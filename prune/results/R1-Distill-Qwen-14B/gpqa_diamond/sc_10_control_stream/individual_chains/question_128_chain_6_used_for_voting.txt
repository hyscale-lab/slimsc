Okay, so I just landed my first big job in a structural biology lab at Stanford. The PI has given me a task to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The amino acid sequence is provided, and I've got four plasmid options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out which plasmid is the right one for this job.

Wait, so the question is about choosing the correct DNA sequence that will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in E. coli. Plasmids usually have the coding sequence for the protein, possibly with some tags or other elements, but I'm guessing the main thing here is getting the correct ORF (open reading frame) that matches the given amino acid sequence.

First, I remember that in molecular cloning, the plasmid's coding sequence should start with the start codon (ATG) and end with the stop codon (usually TAG, TGA, or TAA). So I need to look for the correct reading frame that starts with ATG and ends correctly.

Looking at the options, all of them start with ATG, so that's not the differentiator. But the main thing is the ORF: the DNA sequence should be in the correct frame to produce the given amino acids.

Wait, but the options are very long, so maybe the plasmid contains the correct sequence but perhaps some have the correct reading frame or have the right start and stop codons.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with Met (M), which is correct because the start codon is ATG. So the plasmid's DNA sequence should start with ATG followed by the correct codons.

But looking at the options, all plasmid sequences start with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... So that's the same for options A, B, C, D. Wait, no, let me check. Oh, no, looking again, the options A, B, C, D have similar starts but maybe different lengths or other variations.

Wait, another thing: the correct plasmid should have the ORF in the same reading frame as the provided amino acid sequence. Since E. coli uses a particular start and the plasmid's origin of replication and other elements might affect expression, perhaps the presence of any in-frame stop codons is important. But that's probably too detailed.

Wait, but another consideration: sometimes plasmids are designed with a T7 promoter, which is commonly used in BL21 strains because they have the T7 RNA polymerase. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the ORF. But the question doesn't mention the plasmid's promoter; it just provides the DNA sequences, so maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is the presence of the start codon and the correct reading frame. Let's think about the DNA sequences of the plasmids. Each option presents a DNA sequence that's a coding strand, I believe, starting with ATG.

But the critical point is whether the DNA sequence correctly translates to the given amino acid sequence. So the correct plasmid's DNA should have a sequence that, when read in the correct frame, produces the amino acid sequence.

Another point is the presence of a stop codon. The given amino acid sequence ends with a stop, which is a tryptophan (the last few letters: ...GAPV...). Wait, the given sequence ends with 'VPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD'.

Wait, the last amino acids are 'DSD', which I'm not sure about. But the stop codon in DNA would be TAG, TGA, or TAA, so the DNA would have to end in one of those triplets.

Looking at the options' DNA sequences, I see that each option ends with a certain sequence. Let me check the end of each option.

Option A ends with ...TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Option B ends with ...TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGTCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Option C is shorter. It ends after a certain point. Wait, looking at the line breaks, it seems like option C might be shorter. Let me count the lines. Option C's DNA sequence is presented in 7 lines, while others have more. So option C's sequence is shorter. Hmm, but the given amino acid sequence is longer, so probably the correct plasmid can't be option C because it's too short. So probably C is incorrect.

Option D's DNA sequence looks similar to option B's end. Let me check: it ends with ...TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, perhaps the key is the presence of the correct start and stop codons in frame. Let me think about the very end of the DNA sequence. The stop codon in the DNA would be one of the triplets: TAA, TAG, TGA. Let's look for the last few nucleotides before the end of the plasmid.

Looking at option A, the last few are ...CTGA. So the last codon is CAG, which is Gln. Wait, but that's not a stop codon. Hmm. Similarly, looking at option B: the end is ...ACTGA, so the last codon is TGA. Oh, wait, that is a stop codon. Because TGA is a stop. So the end of option B's sequence is TGA.

Option C's last part is ...ACTGA, same as option B? Wait, no, option C ends earlier. Let me see: option C's last lines are ...TGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last line of option C is ...ACTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So maybe the correct plasmid ends with TGA.

Wait, but the given amino acid sequence doesn't end with a stop codon. Wait, no, the question says the target is the Human P53 protein, which is a full-length protein. So the DNA should include the stop codon after the correct sequence.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake. Because the given amino acid sequence is the actual protein, which includes the start (M) but not the stop. So the DNA plasmid should have the ATG followed by the coding sequence, ending with a stop codon, which is not part of the amino acid sequence.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Looking at option A's last lines: ...GACTGA. So the last codon is TGA. So the DNA ends with TGA.

Option B ends with ...ACTGA, which again is TGA.

Option D also ends with ...ACTGA, same as B.

Wait, but looking more carefully at the last few letters of each option.

Option A: The very last part is GAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last few nucleotides are ACTGA. That's the stop codon TGA.

So all options except C end with TGA, but option C's sequence is shorter and perhaps ends with TGA as well.

Wait, no, let me check each option's ending.

Option A: Ends with ACTGA.

Option B: Ends with ACTGA.

Option C: Ends with ACTGA.

Option D: Ends with ACTGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Another approach: The correct plasmid must have an ORF that starts with ATG and ends with a stop codon, and the rest of the nucleotides must match the codons for the given amino acid sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the presence of a Kozak sequence or Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is important for initiation of translation in prokaryotes. But Shine-Dalgarno is in the plasmid's design, but the given options don't show any of that, as the sequences are likely just the ORFs.

Wait, another key point: E. coli BL21 is often used with a T7 promoter. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the ORF. But the plasmid sequences given don't show any promoter regions, only the coding sequences. So perhaps that's not a factor here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon in the correct frame. The stop codon in the DNA must be in the same reading frame as the start codon.

Looking at the last part of the amino acid sequence: the last few amino acids are ...TRGLTCTGAGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the very end of the amino acid sequence is GAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last line ends with ACTGA, which is the stop codon. So in the DNA, the last codon would be TGA. So the DNA sequence should end with TGA.

Looking at the options, all options (A, B, D) end with TGA as the last codon, as the last triplet is ACTGA for A, B, D, and C. Wait, no, let me recheck.

Option A: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Option B: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA. Same as A.

Option D: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA.

Option C: Ends with ...ACTGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sequences. Let me focus on the actual DNA sequences.

Looking at each option's last lines:

Option A:
...GGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

So the last 6 nucleotides are ACTGA. Wait, no, let me look at the end: ...GACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...CAGACTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Similarly, option B ends with ...GACTCAGACTGA.

Same for D.

Option C's DNA ends with ...CAGACTGA.

Wait, if all options end with TGA, then perhaps that's not the differentiator.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is the presence of any in-frame stop codons before the end.

But that's a lot more involved to check. Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the longest one, but looking at the options, they are all about the same length except C, which is shorter. Since the amino acid sequence is long, the plasmid must be longer, so option C is likely incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me count the number of letters in each option. Each option is a single long string of nucleotides. Since the given amino acid sequence is about 400 residues, the DNA should be about 1200 nucleotides (4*3=12). But looking at the options, each plasmid sequence is way longer than that, so that's probably not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the correct reading frame. The DNA must be in the correct frame to produce the given amino acids. So perhaps one of the options has a reading frame that matches the amino acid sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options has the correct start codon and the correct sequence after, without any frame shifts.

Wait, let me think about the DNA sequences. The start codon is ATG, which is the first three nucleotides in each option.

Then, the next codon is GAG, which codes for Glu (E). The given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSD... So the first amino acid is Met (M), then Glu (E), then Glu (E), Pro (P), etc.

So the DNA sequence should start ATG GAG GAG CGC AGT...

Which it does in all options.

So that's not the issue. Then perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the presence of a Kozak sequence or a ribosome binding site. But E. coli uses the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is usually in the plasmid's design, not necessarily in the coding sequence itself. So that might not be relevant here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when expressing a protein in E. coli, the plasmid may contain a tag, like a His-tag, at the end. But the question doesn't mention any tags, so perhaps all plasmids are intended to produce the untagged protein.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that doesn't have any additional nucleotides after the stop codon, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, the presence of an in-frame stop codon before the end could cause the protein to be truncated. So perhaps the correct plasmid is the one without any such stops.

But without knowing the exact correct sequence, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the main issue is that the correct plasmid must have the correct ORF without any frameshifts or point mutations. So, perhaps one of the plasmids has a mutation in the sequence, like a wrong nucleotide that changes the amino acid.

But without knowing the correct DNA sequence, that's difficult to determine.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that is longer and contains all the necessary nucleotides to code for the entire Human P53 protein. Option C is shorter, so it's probably incorrect.

Looking back, the given amino acid sequence is quite long, so the correct plasmid must be the longest one. But all options except C are about the same length.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me recap.

The question is, which plasmid will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in E. coli BL21.

The correct plasmid must have the ORF that matches the provided amino acid sequence, including the correct start and stop codons.

Looking at the options, the only difference between them is minor variations in the DNA sequence.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is option D.

Wait, wait, looking at the very end of each option. Maybe one of them ends with a TGA stop codon, while others have a different one.

Looking at option A: I think the last few nucleotides are ...ACTGA.

Which is TGA, a stop codon.

Option B: same ending.

Option D: same.

Option C: same.

So all options end with TGA as the last codon.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the presence of a rare codon in the sequence might lead to incorrect expression, but again, without knowing the specific codon usage, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the correct number of nucleotides. The amino acid sequence has 403 residues, so the DNA should be 403*3=1209 nucleotides, plus the start and stop codons, so around 1215 nucleotides. Looking at the options, each is longer than that, but perhaps one is the correct length.

Wait, but all plasmid options provided are the same length, except option C, which is shorter.

Wait, looking at option C, it's presented in 7 lines. Let me count the letters.

But each line in the options has 70 characters, approximately.

Option C has 7 lines: 7 * 70 = 490. So about 490 nucleotides.

The others have more lines: A has 10 lines, B has 10, D has 10. So their lengths are longer.

Given that the amino acid sequence is 403 residues, the DNA should be about 1212 nucleotides. So the correct plasmid should be about that length. Option C is too short, so it's wrong.

So the correct plasmid must be among A, B, D.

Now, the question is, which of these (A, B, D) is the correct one.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the correct plasmid does not have any in-frame stop codons. So, I need to look for the presence of TAG, TGA, or TAA in the DNA sequence.

Wait, but the DNA must end with a stop codon, which is TGA as in all options. So any in-frame stops before that would be a problem.

But without knowing each option's internal sequence, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that matches the given amino acid sequence without any extra nucleotides. But again, without the exact DNA sequence, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, as it's the only one that has a longer sequence, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the start codon is in the correct frame.

Another approach: perhaps the plasmid's ORF is in the same reading frame as the given amino acid sequence. So, the DNA must be read in the same frame as the amino acids.

But all options start with ATG, so the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that uses the correct number of nucleotides, perhaps without any extra nucleotides in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, but I can't assume that.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the correct number of in-frame stop codons. The correct plasmid should have exactly one stop codon at the end. So, any extra stops would be a problem.

But without knowing each option's sequence, I can't determine that.

Wait, maybe the presence of the start codon in the correct frame. All options start with ATG.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because its DNA sequence ends with the same as the given amino acid sequence's end.

Wait, looking at the end of the amino acid sequence, the last part is:

...TRGLTCTGAGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

But looking at the DNA sequences, the end of each plasmid varies in some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that ends with the same nucleotides as the given amino acid sequence's stop.

Wait, the amino acid sequence ends with 'ACTGA', which is the stop codon TGA. So the DNA ends with TGA.

Looking at the options, all options end with TGA as the last codon.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick option D, but I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's the same as option B but with some differences in the middle.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Another approach: maybe the correct plasmid has the correct number of nucleotides to code for the entire sequence.

But without the exact DNA sequence, I can't compare.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the correct plasmid is the one that has the same number of nucleotides as the given amino acid sequence times three, plus the start and stop codons.

The amino acid sequence is 403 residues, so the DNA should be 403*3 + 3 (start) + 3 (stop) = 1215 nucleotides.

Looking at the options, each is about 1200+ nucleotides.

But again, without exact counts, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because in the middle of the sequence, perhaps it has the correct nucleotides.

Wait, looking at the middle part of option D's DNA sequence: ...ATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the middle part seems to match the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the correct answer is probably option D, but I'm not entirely sure, I'll have to make a choice.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that doesn't have any extra nucleotides after the stop codon. Looking at the plasmid sequences, option D ends with ...ACTGA, which is the stop codon. The others also end with the same.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I'll have to go with option D as the correct one, but I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which plasmid will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in *E. coli* BL21, the key considerations are:

1. **Start and Stop Codons**: The correct plasmid must start with the start codon (ATG) and end with a stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA). All options start with ATG and end with TGA, indicating that they all include a stop codon at the end.

2. **Length of the Plasmid**: The amino acid sequence provided is 403 residues long, which corresponds to a DNA sequence of approximately 1212 nucleotides (403 × 3) plus additional nucleotides for the start and stop codons. Option C is significantly shorter than the others, making it unlikely to encode the full-length Human P53 protein.

3. **Presence of Internal Stop Codons**: The correct plasmid should not contain any in-frame stop codons before the final TGA, as these would truncate the protein. Without the exact DNA sequence, it is difficult to confirm the presence or absence of such codons, but this is a critical factor in selecting the correct plasmid.

4. **Consistency with the Amino Acid Sequence**: The DNA sequence must match the given amino acid sequence in the correct reading frame. All options start with ATG and follow the same general structure, but subtle differences in the DNA sequence could lead to mismatches with the amino acid sequence.

Based on the analysis, option C is too short to encode the full-length Human P53 protein and is therefore eliminated. Among options A, B, and D, all appear to include the necessary start and stop codons and are of sufficient length. However, the exact DNA sequence differences make it challenging to definitively choose between them. Given the information provided, option D is selected as the most likely candidate.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I just landed my first big job in a structural biology lab at Stanford. The PI has given me a task to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The amino acid sequence is provided, and I've got four plasmid options to choose from. Hmm, I need to figure out which plasmid is the right one for this job.

Wait, so the question is about choosing the correct DNA sequence that will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in E. coli. Plasmids usually have the coding sequence for the protein, possibly with some tags or other elements, but I'm guessing the main thing here is getting the correct ORF (open reading frame) that matches the given amino acid sequence.

First, I remember that in molecular cloning, the plasmid's coding sequence should start with the start codon (ATG) and end with the stop codon (usually TAG, TGA, or TAA). So I need to look for the correct reading frame that starts with ATG and ends correctly.

Looking at the options, all of them start with ATG, so that's not the differentiator. But the main thing is the ORF: the DNA sequence should be in the correct frame to produce the given amino acids.

Wait, but the options are very long, so maybe the plasmid contains the correct sequence but perhaps some have the correct reading frame or have the right start and stop codons.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with Met (M), which is correct because the start codon is ATG. So the plasmid's DNA sequence should start with ATG followed by the correct codons.

But looking at the options, all plasmid sequences start with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... So that's the same for options A, B, C, D. Wait, no, let me check. Oh, no, looking again, the options A, B, C, D have similar starts but maybe different lengths or other variations.

Wait, another thing: the correct plasmid should have the ORF in the same reading frame as the provided amino acid sequence. Since E. coli uses a particular start and the plasmid's origin of replication and other elements might affect expression, perhaps the presence of any in-frame stop codons is important. But that's probably too detailed.

Wait, but another consideration: sometimes plasmids are designed with a T7 promoter, which is commonly used in BL21 strains because they have the T7 RNA polymerase. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the ORF. But the question doesn't mention the plasmid's promoter; it just provides the DNA sequences, so maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is the presence of the start codon and the correct reading frame. Let's think about the DNA sequences of the plasmids. Each option presents a DNA sequence that's a coding strand, I believe, starting with ATG.

But the critical point is whether the DNA sequence correctly translates to the given amino acid sequence. So the correct plasmid's DNA should have a sequence that, when read in the correct frame, produces the amino acid sequence.

Another point is the presence of a stop codon. The given amino acid sequence ends with a stop, which is a tryptophan (the last few letters: ...GAPV...). Wait, the given sequence ends with 'VPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD'.

Wait, the last amino acids are 'DSD', which I'm not sure about. But the stop codon in DNA would be TAG, TGA, or TAA, so the DNA would have to end in one of those triplets.

Looking at the options' DNA sequences, I see that each option ends with a certain sequence. Let me check the end of each option.

Option A ends with ...TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Option C is shorter. It ends after a certain point. Wait, looking at the line breaks, it seems like option C might be shorter. Let me count the lines. Option C's DNA sequence is presented in 7 lines, while others have more. So option C's sequence is shorter. Hmm, but the given amino acid sequence is longer, so probably the correct plasmid can't be option C because it's too short. So probably C is incorrect.

Option D's DNA sequence looks similar to option B's end. Let me check: it ends with ...TCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, perhaps the key is the presence of the correct start and stop codons in frame. Let me think about the very end of the DNA sequence. The stop codon in the DNA would be one of the triplets: TAA, TAG, TGA. Let's look for the last few nucleotides before the end of the plasmid.

Looking at option A, the last few are ...CTGA. So the last codon is CAG, which is Gln. Wait, but that's not a stop codon. Hmm. Similarly, looking at option B: the end is ...ACTGA, so the last codon is TGA. Oh, wait, that is a stop codon. Because TGA is a stop. So the end of option B's sequence is TGA.

Option C's last part is ...ACTGA, same as option B? Wait, no, option C ends earlier. Let me see: option C's last lines are ...TGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCCCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last line of option C is ...ACTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So maybe the correct plasmid ends with TGA.

Wait, but the given amino acid sequence doesn't end with a stop codon. Wait, no, the question says the target is the Human P53 protein, which is a full-length protein. So the DNA should include the stop codon after the correct sequence.

Wait, I think I must have made a mistake. Because the given amino acid sequence is the actual protein, which includes the start (M) but not the stop. So the DNA plasmid should have the ATG followed by the coding sequence, ending with a stop codon, which is not part of the amino acid sequence.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Looking at option A's last lines: ...GACTGA. So the last codon is TGA. So the DNA ends with TGA.

Option B ends with ...ACTGA, which again is TGA.

Option D also ends with ...ACTGA, same as B.

Wait, but looking more carefully at the last few letters of each option.

Option A: The very last part is GAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last few nucleotides are ACTGA. That's the stop codon TGA.

So all options except C end with TGA, but option C's sequence is shorter and perhaps ends with TGA as well.

Wait, no, let me check each option's ending.

Option A: Ends with ACTGA.

Option B: Ends with ACTGA.

Option C: Ends with ACTGA.

Option D: Ends with ACTGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Another approach: The correct plasmid must have an ORF that starts with ATG and ends with a stop codon, and the rest of the nucleotides must match the codons for the given amino acid sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the presence of a Kozak sequence or Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is important for initiation of translation in prokaryotes. But Shine-Dalgarno is in the plasmid's design, but the given options don't show any of that, as the sequences are likely just the ORFs.

Wait, another key point: E. coli BL21 is often used with a T7 promoter. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the ORF. But the plasmid sequences given don't show any promoter regions, only the coding sequences. So perhaps that's not a factor here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon in the correct frame. The stop codon in the DNA must be in the same reading frame as the start codon.

Looking at the last part of the amino acid sequence: the last few amino acids are ...TRGLTCTGAGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the very end of the amino acid sequence is GAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last line ends with ACTGA, which is the stop codon. So in the DNA, the last codon would be TGA. So the DNA sequence should end with TGA.

Looking at the options, all options (A, B, D) end with TGA as the last codon, as the last triplet is ACTGA for A, B, D, and C. Wait, no, let me recheck.

Option A: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Option B: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA. Same as A.

Option D: Ends with GACTCAGACTGA.

Option C: Ends with ...ACTGA.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sequences. Let me focus on the actual DNA sequences.

Looking at each option's last lines:

Option A:
...GGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

So the last 6 nucleotides are ACTGA. Wait, no, let me look at the end: ...GACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...CAGACTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Similarly, option B ends with ...GACTCAGACTGA.

Same for D.

Option C's DNA ends with ...CAGACTGA.

Wait, if all options end with TGA, then perhaps that's not the differentiator.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is the presence of any in-frame stop codons before the end.

But that's a lot more involved to check. Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the longest one, but looking at the options, they are all about the same length except C, which is shorter. Since the amino acid sequence is long, the plasmid must be longer, so option C is likely incorrect.

Wait, but wait. Let me count the number of letters in each option. Each option is a single long string of nucleotides. Since the given amino acid sequence is about 400 residues, the DNA should be about 1200 nucleotides (4*3=12). But looking at the options, each plasmid sequence is way longer than that, so that's probably not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the correct reading frame. The DNA must be in the correct frame to produce the given amino acids. So perhaps one of the options has a reading frame that matches the amino acid sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options has the correct start codon and the correct sequence after, without any frame shifts.

Wait, let me think about the DNA sequences. The start codon is ATG, which is the first three nucleotides in each option.

Then, the next codon is GAG, which codes for Glu (E). The given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSD... So the first amino acid is Met (M), then Glu (E), then Glu (E), Pro (P), etc.

So the DNA sequence should start ATG GAG GAG CGC AGT...

Which it does in all options.

So that's not the issue. Then perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the presence of a Kozak sequence or a ribosome binding site. But E. coli uses the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is usually in the plasmid's design, not necessarily in the coding sequence itself. So that might not be relevant here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when expressing a protein in E. coli, the plasmid may contain a tag, like a His-tag, at the end. But the question doesn't mention any tags, so perhaps all plasmids are intended to produce the untagged protein.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that doesn't have any additional nucleotides after the stop codon, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, the presence of an in-frame stop codon before the end could cause the protein to be truncated. So perhaps the correct plasmid is the one without any such stops.

But without knowing the exact correct sequence, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the main issue is that the correct plasmid must have the correct ORF without any frameshifts or point mutations. So, perhaps one of the plasmids has a mutation in the sequence, like a wrong nucleotide that changes the amino acid.

But without knowing the correct DNA sequence, that's difficult to determine.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that is longer and contains all the necessary nucleotides to code for the entire Human P53 protein. Option C is shorter, so it's probably incorrect.

Looking back, the given amino acid sequence is quite long, so the correct plasmid must be the longest one. But all options except C are about the same length.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me recap.

The question is, which plasmid will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in E. coli BL21.

The correct plasmid must have the ORF that matches the provided amino acid sequence, including the correct start and stop codons.

Looking at the options, the only difference between them is minor variations in the DNA sequence.

Wait, perhaps the correct plasmid is option D.

Wait, wait, looking at the very end of each option. Maybe one of them ends with a TGA stop codon, while others have a different one.

Looking at option A: I think the last few nucleotides are ...ACTGA.

Which is TGA, a stop codon.

Option B: same ending.

Option D: same.

Option C: same.

So all options end with TGA as the last codon.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the presence of a rare codon in the sequence might lead to incorrect expression, but again, without knowing the specific codon usage, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the correct number of nucleotides. The amino acid sequence has 403 residues, so the DNA should be 403*3=1209 nucleotides, plus the start and stop codons, so around 1215 nucleotides. Looking at the options, each is longer than that, but perhaps one is the correct length.

Wait, but all plasmid options provided are the same length, except option C, which is shorter.

Wait, looking at option C, it's presented in 7 lines. Let me count the letters.

But each line in the options has 70 characters, approximately.

Option C has 7 lines: 7 * 70 = 490. So about 490 nucleotides.

The others have more lines: A has 10 lines, B has 10, D has 10. So their lengths are longer.

Given that the amino acid sequence is 403 residues, the DNA should be about 1212 nucleotides. So the correct plasmid should be about that length. Option C is too short, so it's wrong.

So the correct plasmid must be among A, B, D.

Now, the question is, which of these (A, B, D) is the correct one.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the correct plasmid does not have any in-frame stop codons. So, I need to look for the presence of TAG, TGA, or TAA in the DNA sequence.

Wait, but the DNA must end with a stop codon, which is TGA as in all options. So any in-frame stops before that would be a problem.

But without knowing each option's internal sequence, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that matches the given amino acid sequence without any extra nucleotides. But again, without the exact DNA sequence, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, as it's the only one that has a longer sequence, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the start codon is in the correct frame.

Another approach: perhaps the plasmid's ORF is in the same reading frame as the given amino acid sequence. So, the DNA must be read in the same frame as the amino acids.

But all options start with ATG, so the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that uses the correct number of nucleotides, perhaps without any extra nucleotides in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, but I can't assume that.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the correct number of in-frame stop codons. The correct plasmid should have exactly one stop codon at the end. So, any extra stops would be a problem.

But without knowing each option's sequence, I can't determine that.

Wait, maybe the presence of the start codon in the correct frame. All options start with ATG.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because its DNA sequence ends with the same as the given amino acid sequence's end.

Wait, looking at the end of the amino acid sequence, the last part is:

...TRGLTCTGAGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

But looking at the DNA sequences, the end of each plasmid varies in some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that ends with the same nucleotides as the given amino acid sequence's stop.

Wait, the amino acid sequence ends with 'ACTGA', which is the stop codon TGA. So the DNA ends with TGA.

Looking at the options, all options end with TGA as the last codon.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should pick option D, but I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's the same as option B but with some differences in the middle.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Another approach: maybe the correct plasmid has the correct number of nucleotides to code for the entire sequence.

But without the exact DNA sequence, I can't compare.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the correct plasmid is the one that has the same number of nucleotides as the given amino acid sequence times three, plus the start and stop codons.

The amino acid sequence is 403 residues, so the DNA should be 403*3 + 3 (start) + 3 (stop) = 1215 nucleotides.

Looking at the options, each is about 1200+ nucleotides.

But again, without exact counts, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because in the middle of the sequence, perhaps it has the correct nucleotides.

Wait, looking at the middle part of option D's DNA sequence: ...ATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGAGAGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA.

Wait, the middle part seems to match the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the correct answer is probably option D, but I'm not entirely sure, I'll have to make a choice.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct plasmid is the one that doesn't have any extra nucleotides after the stop codon. Looking at the plasmid sequences, option D ends with ...ACTGA, which is the stop codon. The others also end with the same.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I'll have to go with option D as the correct one, but I'm not certain.


To determine which plasmid will produce the correct Human P53 protein when expressed in *E. coli* BL21, the key considerations are:

1. **Start and Stop Codons**: The correct plasmid must start with the start codon (ATG) and end with a stop codon (TGA, TAG, or TAA). All options start with ATG and end with TGA, indicating that they all include a stop codon at the end.

2. **Length of the Plasmid**: The amino acid sequence provided is 403 residues long, which corresponds to a DNA sequence of approximately 1212 nucleotides (403 × 3) plus additional nucleotides for the start and stop codons. Option C is significantly shorter than the others, making it unlikely to encode the full-length Human P53 protein.

3. **Presence of Internal Stop Codons**: The correct plasmid should not contain any in-frame stop codons before the final TGA, as these would truncate the protein. Without the exact DNA sequence, it is difficult to confirm the presence or absence of such codons, but this is a critical factor in selecting the correct plasmid.

4. **Consistency with the Amino Acid Sequence**: The DNA sequence must match the given amino acid sequence in the correct reading frame. All options start with ATG and follow the same general structure, but subtle differences in the DNA sequence could lead to mismatches with the amino acid sequence.

Based on the analysis, option C is too short to encode the full-length Human P53 protein and is therefore eliminated. Among options A, B, and D, all appear to include the necessary start and stop codons and are of sufficient length. However, the exact DNA sequence differences make it challenging to definitively choose between them. Given the information provided, option D is selected as the most likely candidate.

**Answer: D**
