Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol, and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it can form a buffer solution. But wait, here we have two different salts: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄. What do these salts dissociate into?

KH₂PO₄ (potassium hydrogen phosphate) should dissociate into K⁺, H₂PO₄⁻. Similarly, Na₂HPO₄ (sodium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄^2-. Wait, but wait, the formula given is Na₂HPO4·2H2O. Oh, that's the hydrate. So the formula is Na₂HPO4·2H2O. But when dissolved in water, the 2H2O is part of the structure. So upon dissociation, it would release Na+ ions and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I think these two are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Wait, but the HPO4^2- can also act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Because H3PO4 is triphosphoric acid, and when it loses three protons, you get PO4^3-.

So, the question is asking for [PO4^3-] in the solution.

I think I need to determine how much PO4^3- is present. But wait, how is PO4^3- formed? It comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The relevant equilibrium here would involve HPO4^2- donating a proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. Wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, each step is a deprotonation.

But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that we have a buffer solution. Because they can react with each other:

H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

But since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, their concentrations will affect the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but if I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, how does that affect PO4^3-?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but considering the possible formation of PO4^3- from HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

So for the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low.

But can I calculate it?

Hmm, perhaps I can consider that the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their concentrations. Then, using that pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the buffer equation. Let me think.

First, let me calculate the concentrations of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

The solution volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L.

Molar masses:

KH₂PO₄: 136.09 g/mol → 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007346 mol.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 177.99 g/mol → 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007346 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005614 mol.

These will both be in 0.2 L solution.

So, concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02807 M.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. For KH₂PO₄: each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na₂HPO4·2H2O: each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, yeah, the concentrations are as above.

Now, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps.

Wait, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but which pKa to use?

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → approximately 7.21.

Wait, wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no.

Wait, wait, no, pKa is -log10(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So the pH of the solution would be:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M.

So ratio is 0.02807 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.116.

So pH ≈7.21 + (-0.116) → pH ≈7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The relevant reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094).

Let me calculate [H+]: 10^(-7.094) is about 8.25e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

pH =7.094 → [H+] = 10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.094).

10^(-0.094) is approximately 0.855 (since 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794, 10^(-0.094)= around 0.855).

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.855 = 8.55e-8 M.

So now [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.55e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.55e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (5.05e-14) / (8.55e-8) = approximately 5.9e-7 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 1.8 * 0.02807 * 1e-12 = 0.050526 * 1e-12 = 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.55e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 / 8.55e-8 = (5.0526 / 8.55) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.5905 * 1e-6 ≈ 5.905e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7 → close.

Option B)5.48e-7.

Option D)3.97e-7.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation earlier. Let's do more precise calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.

Ratio = 0.02807 / 0.03673 = ?

Let me compute 0.02807 / 0.03673.

Dividing numerator and denominator by 0.0001: 280.7 / 367.3 → approximately 0.764.

But let me compute more accurately.

0.02807 ÷ 0.03673.

367.3 → 367.3 x 0.0764 is about 280.7?

Wait, 367.3 * 0.764 = let me compute 367.3 * 0.7 = 257.11, 367.3 * 0.064 = approximately 23.4272. So total ≈ 280.537, which is close to 280.7. So the ratio is about 0.764.

Then log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) → log(7.64) + log(1e-1) → 0.8839 -1 → -0.1161. So pH ≈7.21 -0.1161=7.0939.

So pH is approximately 7.094.

Then [H+] = 10^(-7.094) → let me compute this more accurately.

10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7 -0.094) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.094).

What's 10^(-0.094)?

We can compute this using logarithm tables or approximation. Alternatively, using natural logarithm.

ln(10^(-0.094)) = -0.094 * ln(10) ≈ -0.094 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2164.

So e^(-0.2164) ≈ 0.806.

Wait, but 10^(-0.094) = e^(-0.094 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-0.2164).

Compute e^-0.2164. e^0.2164 = approx 1.240 (since e^0.2≈1.2214, e^0.2164 is a bit higher, say around 1.24). So 1/1.24 ≈0.806. So 10^(-0.094) ≈0.806.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.806 ≈8.06e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I had 8.55e-8, which is a bit higher. So which one is more accurate? Let's use the precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute it with more exactness.

Compute 10^(-0.094):

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps a better approach is to use logarithm tables or a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that log(8)=0.9031, so 10^0.9031=8. So 10^(-0.094)=1/(10^0.094).

What's 10^0.094?

We can compute:

We know that 10^0.1≈1.2589.

0.094 is 0.006 less than 0.1.

So perhaps 10^0.094 ≈1.2589 - (derivative at x=0.094) * 0.006.

The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x. So at x=0.094, derivative is ln(10)*10^0.094.

Wait, but that's a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps using a linear approximation.

Let me think: Let’s set x=0.094.

We know that 10^0.1 = 1.258925.

The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x.

At x=0.094, the function increases by (x - 0.1) * ln(10)*10^0.094.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute 10^0.094.

We can write this as e^(0.094 * ln(10)).

ln(10) is approximately 2.302585093.

So 0.094 * 2.302585 ≈0.216445.

e^0.216445 = ?

We can compute e^0.2164.

We know that e^0.2=1.221402758.

e^0.2164 = e^(0.2 + 0.0164) = e^0.2 * e^0.0164.

e^0.0164 ≈1 + 0.0164 + (0.0164)^2/2 ≈1 + 0.0164 + 0.000134 → 1.016534.

So e^0.2164 ≈1.2214 * 1.016534 ≈1.2214 *1.0165 ≈1.241.

So 10^0.094 ≈1.241, so 10^(-0.094) =1/1.241 ≈0.8058.

Therefore, [H+] =1e-7 *0.8058≈8.058e-8 M.

So [H+] ≈8.058e-8 M.

Now, let's compute [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranging, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plug in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02807 M.

[H+]=8.058e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.058e-8).

Let me compute the numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = (1.8 * 0.02807) * 1e-12 = 0.050526 * 1e-12 =5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.058e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] =5.0526e-14 / 8.058e-8 = (5.0526/8.058) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0526 /8.058.

8.058 * 0.627 ≈5.0526.

Wait, 8.058 * 0.627= ?

Let me compute:

8 *0.627=5.016.

0.058 *0.627≈0.0363.

Total ≈5.016 +0.0363=5.0523.

So 5.0526 /8.058≈0.627.

So [PO4^3-] ≈0.627e-6 →6.27e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, I might have made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, let's recompute [PO4^3-] accurately.

Compute numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = (1.8 * 0.02807) * 1e-12.

1.8 *0.02807=0.050526. So 0.050526e-12=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.058e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.058e-8 = (5.0526 /8.058) *1e-6.

5.0526 /8.058: let's compute it accurately.

8.058 into 5.0526.

8.058 *0.627 is 5.0526.

Yes, so 5.0526/8.058=0.627.

So 0.627e-6=6.27e-7.

Looking at options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Option B is 5.48e-7, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the [H+]?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the buffer equation isn't the correct one to use here. Because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So maybe the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-] and [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and then use that pH to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species in solution.

Wait, what's the situation with the phosphate species?

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. In solution, it can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-.

In this solution, we're adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In the solution, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-.

So, perhaps the [PO4^3-] can be calculated using the Ka3 expression.

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is better treated as a polyprotic buffer, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the concentrations more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact moles and concentrations, considering that the solution is 200 mL.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007346 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005614 mol.

So, in 0.2 L, their concentrations are 0.03673 M and 0.02807 M, respectively.

So, the buffer is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈7.207.

Ratio is 0.02807/0.03673=0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈-0.116.

So pH=7.207-0.116=7.091.

So [H+]=10^(-7.091)=8.1e-8 M.

Then, using Ka3=1.8e-12= [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in numbers: (1.8e-12 *0.02807) / (8.1e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12*0.02807=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.1e-8.

So 5.0526e-14/8.1e-8 = approximately 6.24e-7 M.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately: 5.0526e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0526/8.1) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.1 ≈0.6238.

So 0.6238e-6=6.238e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M. So option A is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate to provide H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, respectively. The relevant dissociation step for PO₄³⁻ is:

**HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻**, with \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right),
\]
where \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \) and \(\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\).  

The ratio of concentrations is:
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.03673} \approx 0.764.
\]
\[
\log(0.764) \approx -0.116.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.116 \approx 7.091.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
Using the equilibrium expression for \( K_{a3} \):
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]
- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).
- Substituting values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807) \approx 5.0526 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then, divide by the denominator:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol, and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it can form a buffer solution. But wait, here we have two different salts: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄. What do these salts dissociate into?

KH₂PO₄ (potassium hydrogen phosphate) should dissociate into K⁺, H₂PO₄⁻. Similarly, Na₂HPO₄ (sodium hydrogen phosphate) would dissociate into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄^2-. Wait, but wait, the formula given is Na₂HPO4·2H2O. Oh, that's the hydrate. So the formula is Na₂HPO4·2H2O. But when dissolved in water, the 2H2O is part of the structure. So upon dissociation, it would release Na+ ions and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I think these two are conjugate acid-base pairs. H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). Wait, but the HPO4^2- can also act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? Because H3PO4 is triphosphoric acid, and when it loses three protons, you get PO4^3-.

So, the question is asking for [PO4^3-] in the solution.

I think I need to determine how much PO4^3- is present. But wait, how is PO4^3- formed? It comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The relevant equilibrium here would involve HPO4^2- donating a proton to become PO4^3-.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. Wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 has three dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, each step is a deprotonation.

But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that we have a buffer solution. Because they can react with each other:

H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

But since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, their concentrations will affect the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but if I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, how does that affect PO4^3-?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but considering the possible formation of PO4^3- from HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

So for the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low.

But can I calculate it?

Hmm, perhaps I can consider that the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by their concentrations. Then, using that pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the buffer equation. Let me think.

First, let me calculate the concentrations of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

The solution volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L.

Molar masses:

KH₂PO₄: 136.09 g/mol → 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007346 mol.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 177.99 g/mol → 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007346 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005614 mol.

These will both be in 0.2 L solution.

So, concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03673 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02807 M.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. For KH₂PO₄: each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na₂HPO4·2H2O: each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, yeah, the concentrations are as above.

Now, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps.

Wait, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the pH can be determined using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, but which pKa to use?

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → approximately 7.21.

Wait, wait, no: pKa is -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no.

Wait, wait, no, pKa is -log10(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So the pH of the solution would be:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M.

So ratio is 0.02807 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.116.

So pH ≈7.21 + (-0.116) → pH ≈7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

The relevant reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12. [HPO4^2-] is 0.02807 M. [H+] is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.094).

Let me calculate [H+]: 10^(-7.094) is about 8.25e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

pH =7.094 → [H+] = 10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.094).

10^(-0.094) is approximately 0.855 (since 10^(-0.1) ≈ 0.794, 10^(-0.094)= around 0.855).

So [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.855 = 8.55e-8 M.

So now [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.55e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.55e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ (5.05e-14) / (8.55e-8) = approximately 5.9e-7 M.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = 1.8 * 0.02807 * 1e-12 = 0.050526 * 1e-12 = 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.55e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 / 8.55e-8 = (5.0526 / 8.55) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.5905 * 1e-6 ≈ 5.905e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24e-7 → close.

Option B)5.48e-7.

Option D)3.97e-7.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation earlier. Let's do more precise calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] more accurately.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M.

Ratio = 0.02807 / 0.03673 = ?

Let me compute 0.02807 / 0.03673.

Dividing numerator and denominator by 0.0001: 280.7 / 367.3 → approximately 0.764.

But let me compute more accurately.

0.02807 ÷ 0.03673.

367.3 → 367.3 x 0.0764 is about 280.7?

Wait, 367.3 * 0.764 = let me compute 367.3 * 0.7 = 257.11, 367.3 * 0.064 = approximately 23.4272. So total ≈ 280.537, which is close to 280.7. So the ratio is about 0.764.

Then log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) → log(7.64) + log(1e-1) → 0.8839 -1 → -0.1161. So pH ≈7.21 -0.1161=7.0939.

So pH is approximately 7.094.

Then [H+] = 10^(-7.094) → let me compute this more accurately.

10^(-7.094) = 10^(-7 -0.094) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.094).

What's 10^(-0.094)?

We can compute this using logarithm tables or approximation. Alternatively, using natural logarithm.

ln(10^(-0.094)) = -0.094 * ln(10) ≈ -0.094 * 2.302585 ≈ -0.2164.

So e^(-0.2164) ≈ 0.806.

Wait, but 10^(-0.094) = e^(-0.094 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-0.2164).

Compute e^-0.2164. e^0.2164 = approx 1.240 (since e^0.2≈1.2214, e^0.2164 is a bit higher, say around 1.24). So 1/1.24 ≈0.806. So 10^(-0.094) ≈0.806.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.806 ≈8.06e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I had 8.55e-8, which is a bit higher. So which one is more accurate? Let's use the precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute it with more exactness.

Compute 10^(-0.094):

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0.

But perhaps a better approach is to use logarithm tables or a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that log(8)=0.9031, so 10^0.9031=8. So 10^(-0.094)=1/(10^0.094).

What's 10^0.094?

We can compute:

We know that 10^0.1≈1.2589.

0.094 is 0.006 less than 0.1.

So perhaps 10^0.094 ≈1.2589 - (derivative at x=0.094) * 0.006.

The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x. So at x=0.094, derivative is ln(10)*10^0.094.

Wait, but that's a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps using a linear approximation.

Let me think: Let’s set x=0.094.

We know that 10^0.1 = 1.258925.

The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x.

At x=0.094, the function increases by (x - 0.1) * ln(10)*10^0.094.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me compute 10^0.094.

We can write this as e^(0.094 * ln(10)).

ln(10) is approximately 2.302585093.

So 0.094 * 2.302585 ≈0.216445.

e^0.216445 = ?

We can compute e^0.2164.

We know that e^0.2=1.221402758.

e^0.2164 = e^(0.2 + 0.0164) = e^0.2 * e^0.0164.

e^0.0164 ≈1 + 0.0164 + (0.0164)^2/2 ≈1 + 0.0164 + 0.000134 → 1.016534.

So e^0.2164 ≈1.2214 * 1.016534 ≈1.2214 *1.0165 ≈1.241.

So 10^0.094 ≈1.241, so 10^(-0.094) =1/1.241 ≈0.8058.

Therefore, [H+] =1e-7 *0.8058≈8.058e-8 M.

So [H+] ≈8.058e-8 M.

Now, let's compute [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranging, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plug in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02807 M.

[H+]=8.058e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.058e-8).

Let me compute the numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = (1.8 * 0.02807) * 1e-12 = 0.050526 * 1e-12 =5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.058e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] =5.0526e-14 / 8.058e-8 = (5.0526/8.058) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0526 /8.058.

8.058 * 0.627 ≈5.0526.

Wait, 8.058 * 0.627= ?

Let me compute:

8 *0.627=5.016.

0.058 *0.627≈0.0363.

Total ≈5.016 +0.0363=5.0523.

So 5.0526 /8.058≈0.627.

So [PO4^3-] ≈0.627e-6 →6.27e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, I might have made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, let's recompute [PO4^3-] accurately.

Compute numerator:

1.8e-12 * 0.02807 = (1.8 * 0.02807) * 1e-12.

1.8 *0.02807=0.050526. So 0.050526e-12=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.058e-8.

So 5.0526e-14 /8.058e-8 = (5.0526 /8.058) *1e-6.

5.0526 /8.058: let's compute it accurately.

8.058 into 5.0526.

8.058 *0.627 is 5.0526.

Yes, so 5.0526/8.058=0.627.

So 0.627e-6=6.27e-7.

Looking at options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Option B is 5.48e-7, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation with the [H+]?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the buffer equation isn't the correct one to use here. Because the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So maybe the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the Ka3 and the [HPO4^2-] and [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and then use that pH to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the total phosphate species in solution.

Wait, what's the situation with the phosphate species?

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. In solution, it can exist as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-.

In this solution, we're adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In the solution, the dominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3-.

So, perhaps the [PO4^3-] can be calculated using the Ka3 expression.

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is better treated as a polyprotic buffer, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the concentrations more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact moles and concentrations, considering that the solution is 200 mL.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007346 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005614 mol.

So, in 0.2 L, their concentrations are 0.03673 M and 0.02807 M, respectively.

So, the buffer is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈7.207.

Ratio is 0.02807/0.03673=0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈-0.116.

So pH=7.207-0.116=7.091.

So [H+]=10^(-7.091)=8.1e-8 M.

Then, using Ka3=1.8e-12= [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

Rearranged, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in numbers: (1.8e-12 *0.02807) / (8.1e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12*0.02807=5.0526e-14.

Denominator:8.1e-8.

So 5.0526e-14/8.1e-8 = approximately 6.24e-7 M.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately: 5.0526e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0526/8.1) * 1e-6.

5.0526 /8.1 ≈0.6238.

So 0.6238e-6=6.238e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7 M. So option A is the correct answer.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation equilibria of the phosphate species. The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, which dissociate to provide H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, respectively. The relevant dissociation step for PO₄³⁻ is:

**HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻**, with \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}.
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005614 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005614}{0.2} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right),
\]
where \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \) and \(\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\).  

The ratio of concentrations is:
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.03673} \approx 0.764.
\]
\[
\log(0.764) \approx -0.116.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.116 \approx 7.091.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻]
Using the equilibrium expression for \( K_{a3} \):
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]
- \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).
- Substituting values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807) \approx 5.0526 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then, divide by the denominator:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
