Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found for x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's probability density must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait a second. Oh, because i is sqrt(-1), this is a complex wave function. But when calculating the probability, I should take the square of the absolute value, which is the product of the function and its complex conjugate.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i.

Multiplying them together: |ψ(x)|² = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this over x from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

∫ (a²/(1+x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Calculating the first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding both parts together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root of that gives a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. So around 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The wave function: ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, correct.

Integral of modulus squared from 1 to 3: the first term is a² ln(2), and the second is 0.5. So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So yes, option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the allowed region (between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \)) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i.
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.

Multiplying them together: |ψ(x)|² = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this over x from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

∫ (a²/(1+x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Calculating the first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Adding both parts together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, what's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root of that gives a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. So around 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's probably the answer.

\[

\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option B.
