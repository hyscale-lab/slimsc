Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis... I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds. Specifically, ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by connecting two alkenes.

So, the target molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. Its structure must have a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are 5-isopropyl, 3 and 4 methyl groups. Let me visualize this. The cyclohexene would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, I think. Then, the substituents are on carbons 3,4, and 5.

Wait, the question is about the starting material. Since it's a ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must be a diene, right? Because metathesis typically works with alkenes. So the starting material is likely an octadiene, which upon metathesis will form a ring.

Ring-closing metathesis involves two alkenes. The reaction breaks and reforms double bonds, effectively bringing two ends of the molecule together to form a ring. So the starting molecule is probably a diene where the two double bonds are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring.

The target molecule has substituents at positions 3,4,5. So the starting material, which is a diene, should have substituents in positions that, upon ring closure, will end up at 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the structure. Let's say the starting material is an octadiene. The positions of the double bonds in the starting material will determine where the ring forms.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (the two double bonds in the diene) will cross each other. The metathesis catalyst (like Grubbs catalyst) will break the double bonds and reconnect them in a way that forms the ring.

Let me think about the number of carbons. The target is cyclohexene, so the starting material must have six carbons plus two more for the double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is formed by connecting two ends of the starting diene. So, for example, if the starting material is an octadiene, which is eight carbons, but when it forms a six-membered ring, perhaps the substituents are placed correctly.

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw it out mentally. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the ring, position 1 is the double bond (so between C1 and C2), position 3 has a methyl, position 4 has another methyl, and position 5 has an isopropyl group.

So the starting material would be an octadiene where the substituents are placed such that when the two ends of the diene undergo metathesis, the substituents end up at the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents that are two carbons away from each end. Let me think about the positions.

If the starting material is an octadiene, say, with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7 (so the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents). But that's not correct because the substituents would have to end up in the right positions after the metathesis.

Alternatively, maybe the starting diene has substituents that are in the correct positions for the cyclohexene. Let's imagine the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because the double bonds are at 1 and 7.

Wait, wait. Let's think: The starting material's structure is such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the ends connect to form the six-membered ring. So for an octadiene, positions 1 and 7 have double bonds. So the structure would be 1-7 diene.

Wait, but octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 7 would have a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. But that's not right because that's 1,7-diene would be a nine-carbon molecule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 6. Because when you form a ring via metathesis, the two ends (1 and 6) would connect, making a seven-membered ring? Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the number of carbons.

Wait, the target is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. The starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons. If the starting material is an octadiene, and the ring formed is six-membered, that would require six of the eight carbons to form the ring, leaving two as substituents. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are spaced such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed has the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the positions. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5.

So, in the starting material, the substituents must be at positions that would be three positions away from each end. Because when the diene undergoes metathesis, the ends come together.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. Let me visualize: positions 2 and 6 have double bonds.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. Wait, octa is eight carbons. So numbering from 1 to 8.

So octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure is: CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. Wait, that's not correct because the substituents (3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl) would have to be placed appropriately.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but then when the two double bonds undergo metathesis, which parts would connect?

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (the two double bonds) are each broken, and the catalyst recombines them. So the two alkenes are at the ends, and their ends are connected.

Wait, if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, then the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material would have two double bonds: one between C1 and C2, another between C6 and C7. So the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2= (because it's 1,6-diene)

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is an octadiene with two double bonds. Let me think in terms of the positions of the double bonds.

The target is a cyclohexene, which has six carbons in the ring, so the starting material must have six carbons in a chain that will form the ring, plus two more to form the diene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how the ring forms. Let's say the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at positions a and b, such that when they undergo metathesis, the two ends (from each double bond) connect to form a six-membered ring.

So, for an eight-carbon molecule, to form a six-membered ring, the two double bonds must be positioned so that the two ends (each end of the double bonds) are four carbons apart. Because in the ring, each end is three carbons apart (since 1 and 4 positions would be across the ring), but wait, the ring is six carbons, so to connect 1 and 4, the distance would be three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to imagine the starting material as a diene where the two double bonds are positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, the two ends form a ring. So, for example, in an octadiene, the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7, but that would give a seven-membered ring. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with the two double bonds at positions 1 and 6. So, for example, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. But that doesn't seem to fit the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the substituents end up on the ring. For the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents must be positioned such that during metathesis, they end up in those positions.

Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's nine carbons. No, octa would be eight, so maybe CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents in the starting material. The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So the starting material must have substituents around those positions, perhaps with the double bonds at the ends.

Wait, another approach: ring-closing metathesis typically forms a ring by connecting two alkenes. The two alkenes are at both ends of the molecule. So the starting material would have a diene where the two double bonds are at the ends, and the substituents are in between.

Let me imagine the starting material as 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. No, that's too long. Wait, octa is eight carbons. So positions 1 and 7 can't be, because octa would be 1-8. So 1 and 7 are not possible because that's a nine-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's octa-2,6-diene. So the substituents are at 3 and 4 (the two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). Let me see. When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (2,3 and 6,7) would undergo exchange. So the catalyst would break the double bonds, and the ends would form new bonds, creating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct positions for the double bonds are 1 and 6. Let me think: the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds would break, and the ends would connect.

So, the rings would form between the 2nd carbon and the 7th carbon. Let me count the carbons:

Positions 1 (CH2=) and 2 (CH-), then CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH2, then CH2 (position 7), which is connected via double bond to CH2 (position 8).

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, each double bond is cleaved, and the catalyst facilitates the exchange between the ends. So if we have a diene with two double bonds, the catalyst would break each double bond into two fragments and then recombine them.

Wait, another approach: in a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are at the ends of a diene. So the first double bond is at the beginning, and the second one is somewhere in the middle, such that when they undergo metathesis, the two ends form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that would be nine carbons, which can't be right because the starting material is an octadiene (eight carbons). So, perhaps the correct double bond positions are 1 and 6.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options.

The options are:

A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

B) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

C) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

D) 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

So, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl cyclohexene.

So, the substituents in the starting material must be in positions where, upon closing the ring via metathesis, they end up in correct positions. Let's imagine that the starting material has the substituents 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl, and the double bonds are placed such that when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms correctly.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the double bonds are at 1 and 6. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, that's eight carbons. So positions:

1: CH2=

2: CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH2.

Wait, but the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. Hmm, that would make the starting material octa-1,6-diene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, that's nine carbons. Oh wait, no, octa is eight, so the double bonds are at 1 and 6, so positions 1-2 and 6-7? How? Because for eight carbons, the positions are 1 to 8. So the double bonds would be between 1-2 and between 6-7.

Wait, now the substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, substituents are at 3,4,5. When the ring forms, the ends of the double bonds (positions 2 and 7) will form the ring.

So when the metathesis occurs, the double bonds break and form new bonds. So the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) will connect to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond). So the ring would be formed between C2 and C7.

Wait, but the starting material has eight carbons. So when you form a ring by connecting C2 and C7, the ring would have six members: from C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, and back to C2. Wait, that's six carbons in the ring, which matches the target cyclohexene.

So in this case, the substituents are as follows: C3 and C4 are methyl, and C5 is isopropyl.

So in the starting material, C3 and C4 are methyl, and C5 is isopropyl.

After metathesis, the ring will have substituents at 3,4,5 positions. So option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me see. When the ring forms, the substituents at C3,4,5 in the starting material become the substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the ring. Because in the ring, C1 is the former C2 and C7, and the chain in between becomes the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the positions in the starting material and how they map to the ring.

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene. So the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So the positions in the starting material are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

So substituents are:

3: methyl,

4: methyl,

5: isopropyl.

The double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst will break both double bonds. The ends of the double bonds (positions 2 and 7) will form bonds to form the ring.

So the ring will consist of the chain from position 2 to position 7, which is 6 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7), forming a ring (cyclohexene). The substituents at 3,4,5 will be on the ring at positions 2,3,4 of the new ring. Wait, that can't be right because in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numbering. Let me think again.

In the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle part of the molecule. When the ring is formed, this middle part becomes the middle of the ring.

So, in the ring, the positions would be:

Ring position 1: former position 2,

Ring position 2: former position 3,

Ring position 3: former position 4,

Ring position 4: former position 5,

Ring position 5: former position 6,

Ring position 6: former position 7.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ring positions are numbered based on where the bonds form.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the starting material as:

1: CH2=,

2: CH-,

3: CH2-,

4: CH(CH3)-,

5: CH(CH3)-,

6: CH2-,

7: CH2=,

8: CH2.

Wait, but the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, so the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-8. So the starting material would be:

1: CH2=,

2: CH-,

3: CH2-,

4: CH(CH3)-,

5: CH(CH3)-,

6: CH2-,

7: CH2=,

8: CH2.

Wait, but then the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds break. The two ends (the CH2= ends) would exchange partners, leading to the formation of a new double bond.

So the two ends, position 2 and position 7, would form a new bond. So the ring would be formed from positions 2,3,4,5,6,7, making a six-membered ring.

So the substituents at 3 (CH2-), 4 (CH(CH3)-), 5 (CH(CH3)-) would end up at positions 2,3,4 in the ring.

Wait, but the target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. So perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong in the ring.

In the target, position 1 is the double bond. So the ring is:

1-2: double bond,

3: methyl,

4: methyl,

5: isopropyl.

So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5 (same as the target), and after metathesis, those become positions 3,4,5 in the ring. Because in the ring, the first position is position 2 of the starting material, and the substituents are in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Because when metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 1 and 6, the two ends (positions 2 and 7) form a bond, making a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 in the starting material would correspond to positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the requirements of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds to form a ring. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

The starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly in the target molecule. Additionally, the starting material must have eight carbons (an octadiene) to form the six-membered cyclohexene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. However, this would result in a seven-membered ring upon metathesis, which does not match the six-membered cyclohexene target. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. Upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. When the double bonds undergo metathesis, the ends of the molecule (positions 2 and 7) form a bond, creating a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is correct.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, and the substituents are misplaced. Upon metathesis, the substituents would not align with the target molecule's substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate double bond positions and substituents to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene using ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis...

Wait, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to draw it out mentally. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So in the ring, position 1 is the double bond (so between C1 and C2), position 3 has a methyl, position 4 has another methyl, and position 5 has an isopropyl group.

So the starting material would be an octadiene where the substituents are placed such that when the two ends of the diene undergo metathesis, the substituents end up at the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents that are two carbons away from each end. Let me think about the positions.

If the starting material is an octadiene, say, with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7 (so the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with substituents). But that's not correct because the substituents would have to end up in the right positions after the metathesis.

So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right because the double bonds are at 1 and 7.

Wait, wait. Let's think: The starting material's structure is such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the ends connect to form the six-membered ring. So for an octadiene, positions 1 and 7 have double bonds. So the structure would be 1-7 diene.

Wait, but octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 7 would have a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. But that's not right because that's 1,7-diene would be a nine-carbon molecule. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 6. Because when you form a ring via metathesis, the two ends (1 and 6) would connect, making a seven-membered ring? Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the number of carbons.

Wait, the target is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. The starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons. If the starting material is an octadiene, and the ring formed is six-membered, that would require six of the eight carbons to form the ring, leaving two as substituents. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are spaced such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring formed has the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the positions. The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5.

So, in the starting material, the substituents must be at positions that would be three positions away from each end. Because when the diene undergoes metathesis, the ends come together.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. Let me visualize: positions 2 and 6 have double bonds.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. Wait, octa is eight carbons. So numbering from 1 to 8.

So octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure is: CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. Wait, that's not correct because the substituents (3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl) would have to be placed appropriately.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but then when the two double bonds undergo metathesis, which parts would connect?

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (the two double bonds) are each broken, and the catalyst recombines them. So the two alkenes are at the ends, and their ends are connected.

Wait, if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, then the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material would have two double bonds: one between C1 and C2, another between C6 and C7. So the structure would be:

1: CH2-

2: CH2= (because it's 1,6-diene)

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is an octadiene with two double bonds. Let me think in terms of the positions of the double bonds.

The target is a cyclohexene, which has six carbons in the ring, so the starting material must have six carbons in a chain that will form the ring, plus two more to form the diene.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how the ring forms. Let's say the starting material is an octadiene with double bonds at positions a and b, such that when they undergo metathesis, the two ends (from each double bond) connect to form a six-membered ring.

So, for an eight-carbon molecule, to form a six-membered ring, the two double bonds must be positioned so that the two ends (each end of the double bonds) are four carbons apart. Because in the ring, each end is three carbons apart (since 1 and 4 positions would be across the ring), but wait, the ring is six carbons, so to connect 1 and 4, the distance would be three carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to imagine the starting material as a diene where the two double bonds are positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, the two ends form a ring. So, for example, in an octadiene, the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7, but that would give a seven-membered ring. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with the two double bonds at positions 1 and 6. So, for example, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2. But that doesn't seem to fit the substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the substituents end up on the ring. For the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents must be positioned such that during metathesis, they end up in those positions.

Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's nine carbons. No, octa would be eight, so maybe CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents in the starting material. The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So the starting material must have substituents around those positions, perhaps with the double bonds at the ends.

Wait, another approach: ring-closing metathesis typically forms a ring by connecting two alkenes. The two alkenes are at both ends of the molecule. So the starting material would have a diene where the two double bonds are at the ends, and the substituents are in between.

Let me imagine the starting material as 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. No, that's too long. Wait, octa is eight carbons. So positions 1 and 7 can't be, because octa would be 1-8. So 1 and 7 are not possible because that's a nine-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's octa-2,6-diene. So the substituents are at 3 and 4 (the two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). Let me see. When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (2,3 and 6,7) would undergo exchange. So the catalyst would break the double bonds, and the ends would form new bonds, creating the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct positions for the double bonds are 1 and 6. Let me think: the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds would break, and the ends would connect.

So, the rings would form between the 2nd carbon and the 7th carbon. Let me count the carbons:

Positions 1 (CH2=) and 2 (CH-), then CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH2, then CH2 (position 7), which is connected via double bond to CH2 (position 8).

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, each double bond is cleaved, and the catalyst facilitates the exchange between the ends. So if we have a diene with two double bonds, the catalyst would break each double bond into two fragments and then recombine them.

Wait, another approach: in a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are at the ends of a diene. So the first double bond is at the beginning, and the second one is somewhere in the middle, such that when they undergo metathesis, the two ends form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that would be nine carbons, which can't be right because the starting material is an octadiene (eight carbons). So, perhaps the correct double bond positions are 1 and 6.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options.

The options are:

A) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

B) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

C) 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

D) 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

So, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl cyclohexene.

So, the substituents in the starting material must be in positions where, upon closing the ring via metathesis, they end up in correct positions. Let's imagine that the starting material has the substituents 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl, and the double bonds are placed such that when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms correctly.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the double bonds are at 1 and 6. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, that's eight carbons. So positions:

1: CH2=

2: CH-

3: CH2-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH3)-

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH2.

Wait, but the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. Hmm, that would make the starting material octa-1,6-diene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, that's nine carbons. Oh wait, no, octa is eight, so the double bonds are at 1 and 6, so positions 1-2 and 6-7? How? Because for eight carbons, the positions are 1 to 8. So the double bonds would be between 1-2 and between 6-7.

Wait, now the substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, substituents are at 3,4,5. When the ring forms, the ends of the double bonds (positions 2 and 7) will form the ring.

So when the metathesis occurs, the double bonds break and form new bonds. So the 2nd carbon (from the first double bond) will connect to the 7th carbon (from the second double bond). So the ring would be formed between C2 and C7.

Wait, but the starting material has eight carbons. So when you form a ring by connecting C2 and C7, the ring would have six members: from C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, and back to C2. Wait, that's six carbons in the ring, which matches the target cyclohexene.

So in this case, the substituents are as follows: C3 and C4 are methyl, and C5 is isopropyl.

So in the starting material, C3 and C4 are methyl, and C5 is isopropyl.

After metathesis, the ring will have substituents at 3,4,5 positions. So option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me see. When the ring forms, the substituents at C3,4,5 in the starting material become the substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the ring. Because in the ring, C1 is the former C2 and C7, and the chain in between becomes the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the positions in the starting material and how they map to the ring.

The starting material is octa-1,6-diene. So the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So the positions in the starting material are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

So substituents are:

3: methyl,

4: methyl,

5: isopropyl.

The double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst will break both double bonds. The ends of the double bonds (positions 2 and 7) will form bonds to form the ring.

So the ring will consist of the chain from position 2 to position 7, which is 6 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7), forming a ring (cyclohexene). The substituents at 3,4,5 will be on the ring at positions 2,3,4 of the new ring. Wait, that can't be right because in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numbering. Let me think again.

In the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle part of the molecule. When the ring is formed, this middle part becomes the middle of the ring.

So, in the ring, the positions would be:

Ring position 1: former position 2,

Ring position 2: former position 3,

Ring position 3: former position 4,

Ring position 4: former position 5,

Ring position 5: former position 6,

Ring position 6: former position 7.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the ring positions are numbered based on where the bonds form.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the starting material as:

1: CH2=,

2: CH-,

3: CH2-,

4: CH(CH3)-,

5: CH(CH3)-,

6: CH2-,

7: CH2=,

8: CH2.

Wait, but the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, so the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no, octa is eight carbons, so positions 1-8. So the starting material would be:

1: CH2=,

2: CH-,

3: CH2-,

4: CH(CH3)-,

5: CH(CH3)-,

6: CH2-,

7: CH2=,

8: CH2.

Wait, but then the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7.

So, when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds break. The two ends (the CH2= ends) would exchange partners, leading to the formation of a new double bond.

So the two ends, position 2 and position 7, would form a new bond. So the ring would be formed from positions 2,3,4,5,6,7, making a six-membered ring.

So the substituents at 3 (CH2-), 4 (CH(CH3)-), 5 (CH(CH3)-) would end up at positions 2,3,4 in the ring.

Wait, but the target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. So perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong in the ring.

In the target, position 1 is the double bond. So the ring is:

1-2: double bond,

3: methyl,

4: methyl,

5: isopropyl.

So the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

In the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5 (same as the target), and after metathesis, those become positions 3,4,5 in the ring. Because in the ring, the first position is position 2 of the starting material, and the substituents are in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Because when metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 1 and 6, the two ends (positions 2 and 7) form a bond, making a ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 in the starting material would correspond to positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the target molecule and the requirements of the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds to form a ring. The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

The starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly in the target molecule. Additionally, the starting material must have eight carbons (an octadiene) to form the six-membered cyclohexene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. However, this would result in a seven-membered ring upon metathesis, which does not match the six-membered cyclohexene target. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. Upon metathesis, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. When the double bonds undergo metathesis, the ends of the molecule (positions 2 and 7) form a bond, creating a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is correct.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, and the substituents are misplaced. Upon metathesis, the substituents would not align with the target molecule's substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate double bond positions and substituents to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.
