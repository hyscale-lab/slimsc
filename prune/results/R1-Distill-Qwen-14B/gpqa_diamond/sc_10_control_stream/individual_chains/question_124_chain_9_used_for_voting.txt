Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the question says particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Wait, so initially, with a Lorentz factor gamma of 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds reach. So, the number of particles that reach the walls must depend on their speed and how far they can travel before decaying.

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle is tau, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. Because Lorentz factor affects time dilation. So the particles that reach the detector must live long enough to travel the radius of the detector.

Wait, but the problem says that one third reach the walls. So, their lifetime must be such that the number that decay before reaching the wall is two-thirds, and the ones that make it are one third.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: if a particle has a lifetime tau, then the time it experiences is tau, but in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. So the distance it can travel before decaying is gamma tau multiplied by its speed.

But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance L is approximately gamma tau c.

Wait, but in the initial case, L must be equal to the radius of the detector, right? Because the particles that reach the walls are the ones that traveled 30 meters.

Wait no, wait. The initial setup is that the particles are created at the center. So the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. So if a particle's lifetime is such that it can travel 30 m, then it'll reach the wall.

Wait, but in the problem, only one third of them reach. Hmm. So maybe the average lifetime isn't enough for all of them to reach. Because some decay before.

Wait, perhaps the fraction is determined by the ratio of their lifetime to the proper time needed to reach the wall.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the relation between the time it takes to reach the wall in the lab frame and their proper lifetime.

Wait, let's model this.

In the lab frame, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is time t = radius / speed. Since speed is ~c, t ≈ R/c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 1e-7 s.

The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the particle will decay after time gamma tau. So the particle will reach the wall if gamma tau >= t. Because if the particle's lifetime in the lab is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, then it can reach.

Wait, but in that case, all particles would reach the wall, because gamma is positive, tau is positive. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay is a Poisson process, and the probability that a particle doesn't decay during time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), so the probability to reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, that might make sense. Because the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, so the decay probability is based on that.

So probability P to reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3.

So 1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

But we can write t = R/(beta c). Wait, because the particle's speed isn't exactly c. For ultra-relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1, but maybe I should be precise.

Wait, the problem says ultra-relativistic, so beta is about 1. So maybe beta is approximately 1, so t ≈ R / c.

Wait, but perhaps beta is not exactly 1. Hmm. But maybe in this problem, beta is considered to be 1, so R = c * t, so t = R / c.

So given that, let's proceed.

So, for the initial case:

1/3 = exp( - (R/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (R) / (c gamma tau) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = R/(c gamma tau)

So gamma tau = R/(c ln 3 )

Now, for the new gamma, gamma', we want the probability P' to reach the wall to be 2/3.

So 2/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma' tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma' tau )

Multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = R/(c gamma' tau )

But from the initial case, R/(c gamma tau) = ln 3.

So let me write:

gamma' tau = R/(c ln (3/2 )) 

But from the initial case, R/( c gamma tau) = ln3. So gamma tau = R/(c ln3 )

So substituting into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = R/(c ln(3/2 )) 

But R/(c gamma tau) = ln3, so R/(c) = gamma tau ln3.

Wait, substituting R/(c) = gamma tau ln3 into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = (gamma tau ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2 ) )

So gamma' = gamma * ( ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) ) )

But gamma is 20 in the initial case. So:

gamma' = 20 * (ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

Compute this value.

Let me calculate ln3 ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5)=0.4055.

So gamma' ≈ 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 20 * (2.708) ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, in the initial case, P is 1/3, which is the probability of not decaying in time t. So 1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

So ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma tau) → t/(gamma tau) = ln3 → t = gamma tau ln3.

Wait, but t is R/(beta c), as the time to reach the wall.

So t = R/(beta c) = gamma tau ln3 → R/(beta c) = gamma tau ln3.

So gamma tau = R/(beta c ln3 )

Now, for the new gamma, gamma', the new probability is 2/3.

So 2/3 = exp( - R/(beta c gamma' tau) )

So ln(2/3) = - R/(beta c gamma' tau )

Multiply both sides by -1: ln(3/2) = R/(beta c gamma' tau )

But from the initial case, R/(beta c gamma tau ) = ln3.

So substituting gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = R/(beta c ln(3/2 )) 

But R/(beta c gamma tau ) = ln3 → R/(beta c ) = gamma tau ln3.

Substituting into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = (gamma tau ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

So gamma' = gamma * ( ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

Which is the same as before. So gamma' ≈ 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 54.16.

So the answer should be A) 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' decay probabilities and their Lorentz factors. The probability \( P \) of a particle reaching the detector walls is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for the particle to travel the radius of the detector, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. For ultra-relativistic particles, the time \( t \) is approximately:

\[
t = \frac{R}{\beta c},
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector radius, \( \beta \approx 1 \), and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Initial Case (\( \gamma = 20 \), \( P = \frac{1}{3} \)):
For the initial Lorentz factor \( \gamma = 20 \), the probability of reaching the walls is \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{20 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{20 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot 20 \tau} = \ln(3),
\]

or equivalently:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c} = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### New Case (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \)):
For the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma' \), the probability of reaching the walls is \( P = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

From the initial case, we know \( \frac{R}{\beta c} = 20 \tau \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the new equation:

\[
\frac{20 \tau \ln(3)}{\gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\gamma' = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Calculation:
Using approximate values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma' \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \).

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is **54**.

Wait, that might make sense. Because the particle's lifetime is gamma tau, so the decay probability is based on that.

So probability P to reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, gamma is 20, and P is 1/3.

So 1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

But we can write t = R/(beta c). Wait, because the particle's speed isn't exactly c. For ultra-relativistic speeds, beta is approximately 1, but maybe I should be precise.

Wait, the problem says ultra-relativistic, so beta is about 1. So maybe beta is approximately 1, so t ≈ R / c.

Wait, but perhaps beta is not exactly 1. Hmm. But maybe in this problem, beta is considered to be 1, so R = c * t, so t = R / c.

So given that, let's proceed.

So, for the initial case:

1/3 = exp( - (R/(c)) / (gamma tau) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (R) / (c gamma tau) )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = R/(c gamma tau)

So gamma tau = R/(c ln 3 )

Now, for the new gamma, gamma', we want the probability P' to reach the wall to be 2/3.

So 2/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma' tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(2/3) = - R/(c gamma' tau )

Multiply by -1:

ln(3/2) = R/(c gamma' tau )

But from the initial case, R/(c gamma tau) = ln 3.

So let me write:

gamma' tau = R/(c ln (3/2 )) 

But from the initial case, R/( c gamma tau) = ln3. So gamma tau = R/(c ln3 )

So substituting into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = R/(c ln(3/2 )) 

But R/(c gamma tau) = ln3, so R/(c) = gamma tau ln3.

Wait, substituting R/(c) = gamma tau ln3 into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = (gamma tau ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2 ) )

So gamma' = gamma * ( ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) ) )

But gamma is 20 in the initial case. So:

gamma' = 20 * (ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

Compute this value.

Let me calculate ln3 ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5)=0.4055.

So gamma' ≈ 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 20 * (2.708) ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, in the initial case, P is 1/3, which is the probability of not decaying in time t. So 1/3 = exp( - t/(gamma tau) )

So ln(1/3) = - t/(gamma tau) → t/(gamma tau) = ln3 → t = gamma tau ln3.

Wait, but t is R/(beta c), as the time to reach the wall.

So t = R/(beta c) = gamma tau ln3 → R/(beta c) = gamma tau ln3.

So gamma tau = R/(beta c ln3 )

Now, for the new gamma, gamma', the new probability is 2/3.

So 2/3 = exp( - R/(beta c gamma' tau) )

So ln(2/3) = - R/(beta c gamma' tau )

Multiply both sides by -1: ln(3/2) = R/(beta c gamma' tau )

But from the initial case, R/(beta c gamma tau ) = ln3.

So substituting gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = R/(beta c ln(3/2 )) 

But R/(beta c gamma tau ) = ln3 → R/(beta c ) = gamma tau ln3.

Substituting into gamma' tau:

gamma' tau = (gamma tau ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

So gamma' = gamma * ( ln3 ) / ( ln(3/2) )

Which is the same as before. So gamma' ≈ 20 * (1.0986)/(0.4055) ≈ 54.16.

So the answer should be A) 54.

\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[

\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{20 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot 20 \tau} = \ln(3),
\]

or equivalently:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c} = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### New Case (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \)):
For the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma' \), the probability of reaching the walls is \( P = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the probability formula:

\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R}{\beta c \cdot \gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

From the initial case, we know \( \frac{R}{\beta c} = 20 \tau \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the new equation:

\[
\frac{20 \tau \ln(3)}{\gamma' \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).

Simplifying:

\[
\gamma' = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Calculation:
Using approximate values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma' \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \).

The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is **54**.
