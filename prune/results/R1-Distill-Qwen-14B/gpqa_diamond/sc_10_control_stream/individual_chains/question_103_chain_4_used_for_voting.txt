Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reaction steps. 

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is a ketone. So the structure should be a benzene ring with substituents attached. The substituents are a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, but wait—phenyl groups are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So for benzene, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone? Or is the ketone part attached in a certain way?

Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one), but when it's attached to a benzene ring, it's typically as a ketone group. So the benzene ring is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) as a substituent. So the molecule is acetophenone with additional substituents. 

Wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone (C=O) attached. So in this case, the ketone is on the benzene ring, and there are two other substituents: bromine and nitro groups. So the positions would be relative to the ketone. Let's think: the ketone is in position 1. Then the bromine is in position 3, and the nitro in position 5. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (C=O), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but when you number the ring, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So the numbering is such that the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5. 

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine would be two carbons away (positions 3), and nitro at 5, which is four away? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the positions are 3 and 5 relative to each other. Let me draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So the benzene ring would look like this: positions 1 (C=O), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So that's a meta arrangement between Br and NO2. But wait, the positions are 1,3,5 on the benzene ring. Wait, that would make the substituents all at every other position, so that's possible.

Wait, but wait a minute. The compound is named 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents on the phenyl group are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (the ketone). So the acetophenone part is the ketone attached to the benzene (the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon). So the benzene ring has the ketone at position 1 (let's say), bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So that's a meta arrangement between Br and NO2, and both are para to the ketone? Or wait, no—position 3 and 5 are meta to each other, but each is para to the ketone (since 1 is attached to the ketone, 3 is two positions away, so meta). So the ketone is at 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5. So the three substituents (C=O, Br, NO2) are all on the benzene ring at positions 1,3,5. So that gives a symmetrical arrangement? Or maybe not, but that's the structure.

Now, the goal is to start with benzene and go through a series of reactions to get this compound. The options give different sequences, each with several steps. Each step is a reaction condition, so I need to figure out which sequence correctly builds the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the typical reactions used to introduce substituents on benzene. The main pathways are nitration, bromination, acetylation (using acetyl chloride or similar), and perhaps some reduction steps.

But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is the first substituent introduced, and then the others are added in the correct positions.

But wait, introducing substituents on benzene is tricky because once you add one group, the next substitution will occur in a certain position relative to it, depending on directing effects.

So let's think about the directing effects of different groups. Nitro groups are meta directors. Bromine is typically a meta director as well, unless it's part of a leaving group scenario (like in aromatic substitution where it's a leaving group, but I think in this case, Br is a substituent, so it's a meta director).

But wait, wait. When you introduce a nitro group, it's a strong meta-directing group. When you introduce a Br, it's a meta director as well. Acetophenone (the ketone) is a strong activating group? No, wait: the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group, and it's meta directing. So when the ketone is attached, it will direct incoming substituents to the meta positions.

So the plan is to first introduce the ketone (since it's a meta director), then introduce the nitro group, and then the bromine in the correct positions.

Wait, but the target has both Br and NO2 on the ring, so maybe the order of adding these substituents matters. Let me think.

So, step 1: Benzene to acetophenone. How is that done? Acetophenone is usually made by Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. So step 1 would be CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Once the ketone is on the ring, the next substituents must be added in the meta positions relative to the ketone. But wait, the target has two substituents: Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, but wait, the ketone is at position 1. Then, the nitro would be at position 3 (meta to ketone), and Br at position 5 (which is also meta to ketone but in a different position). Or is the nitro in position 5 relative to the ketone, which is also meta?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the positions again. The benzene ring is a six-membered ring. Let's imagine the acetophenone is at position 1. Then, meta positions are 3 and 5. So adding substituents in positions 3 and 5 would require that we add each substituent in the correct order.

But wait, nitration is a reaction that can be directed by the existing substituent. So after acetophenone is formed, the next substituent will go into the meta position. Let's say we nitrate the acetophenone next. So the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5?

Wait, when you have a meta director, incoming substituents can go into any of the available meta positions. So if the ketone is at position 1, the available meta positions are 3 and 5. Depending on the reaction conditions, the nitro group could go into either. But for the target molecule, it's specifically 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So perhaps the nitro group is at position 5, and the bromine is at position 3. Or vice versa.

Wait, but the target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the ketone.

So the plan is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation)
2. Introduce nitro group in position 5 (meta to ketone)
3. Introduce bromine in position 3 (meta to ketone)

Wait, but wait: after the ketone is introduced, the next substituent will go into a meta position. Let's say we nitrate next. Then the nitro group would be at position 3 or 5. But in the target, it's 5-nitro. Hmm, perhaps that's not the order. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is added before the nitro group.

But wait, wait—another approach. Let's think about the possible steps in each option. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: The steps are i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let's see. So step i is Friedel-Crafts to add the ketone. Then step ii is bromination with FeBr3, which is a typical bromination (electrophilic substitution). So after the ketone is added, Br would enter at the meta position. Then step iii is nitration. So after adding Br, nitrating would depend on where the Br is directing.

Wait, but after adding Br, which is a meta director, the nitration would happen at the meta position relative to Br. But wait, the initial substituent is the ketone, then Br, then nitro. Hmm, maybe this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, let's think about the target molecule: substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1. So we need Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So the first substituent is the ketone. Then, the next substituent can be either Br or nitro in position 3, and the other in position 5.

But the order in which we add substituents affects where each goes. Let's see.

If we first add Br, after the ketone. Since the ketone is meta director, Br would go into position 3 (meta to ketone). Then, nitration would occur.

Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Then, when we nitrate, the nitro group will be directed by the existing substituents. Since Br is a meta director, but the ketone is also a meta director. So where would the nitro group go? Hmm.

Wait, when multiple substituents are present, the directing effect is determined by the most activating group, but since both Br and ketone are deactivating (met directors), the nitro group would enter where possible.

Wait, perhaps in a situation with two meta directors, the incoming group goes into the position that is meta to both, but that's not possible unless the substituents are arranged in a way that allows that. Alternatively, the substituent with the strongest directing effect may dominate. But since both are meta directors, perhaps the nitro group would enter at position 5, which is meta relative to the ketone and para to the Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option.

Option B: Steps are i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that starts with bromination of benzene. So benzene → bromobenzene. Then nitration (adds nitro group as next substituent). Then acylation. Hmm, but acylation requires Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. But bromobenzene is deactivated; Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's a problem. So option B is probably incorrect because after adding Br and nitro (both meta directors), trying to do Friedel-Crafts would fail because the ring is too deactivated. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: Steps are i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm. Starts with nitration of benzene. So benzene → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl—maybe a reduction? Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing condition, perhaps for the nitro group. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine. So step ii would turn nitro into amine. Then step iii is acylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. An amine is strongly activating, so acylation would occur. So acylation of aniline would add a ketone group. But wait, the amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur in the para and ortho positions relative to the amine. But we want the ketone in the position that will direct the other substituents correctly. Hmm, but if we have the amine and then acylation, the ketone would be in the para position relative to the amine. So the nitro group is first, which is meta directing. Then, after reduction, you have an amine, which is ortho/para directing. Then acylation would add the ketone in para to the amine. That might complicate things.

Wait, if the initial steps are nitration (nitro group), then reduction to amine, then Friedel-Crafts acylation. So the ring would have amine and ketone. But wait, Friedel-Crafts can't be done on a ring with an amine because the amine is a strong activating group, but also, after acylation, the ring now has a ketone (deactivating) and an amine (activating). Then step iv is bromination with FeBr3. Now, with both a ketone and an amine, where would the Br go? The amine is ortho/para director, the ketone is meta. So perhaps the Br would go into a position directed by the amine, but perhaps in this scenario, it's possible.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the positions again. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone. So the acetone is in position 1, bromine in 3, nitro in 5. So in this option, after nitration, reduction, acylation, and bromination, would the substituents end up correctly?

Alternatively, maybe this isn't the right approach. Let me look at option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, this starts with nitration again. So benzene → nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine, making phenylamine. Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → this is a diazotization step, typically done at low temps. Then step iv: H3PO2. Oh wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, and in the presence of a diazonium salt, it can do a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but wait, no, H3PO2 is used for reductive elimination, perhaps for introducing Br or Cl. Wait, wait—another possibility: after diazotization, if you treat with H3PO2, it might lead to hydroxylation. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I might be getting this wrong. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, with H2O (acidic), it's hydrolysis to phenol. With CuCN, it's cyanation. With CuX (X=I, Br, Cl), it's substitution to introduce X. So if we have step iii as diazotization, then step iv is H3PO2, which is a reagent used in the thiocyanate reaction or perhaps in the production of amines. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up with other reagents. Alternatively, perhaps this is a step to form a bromine substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization (step iii), the phenol is formed in step iv. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used to reduce certain groups, like in the Birch reduction. Hmm.

This seems complicated. Let me think about the overall approach. The target molecule has three substituents on benzene: C=O, Br, and NO2. The substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So the order of adding substituents probably needs to control where each goes.

But perhaps another approach is to determine the correct order of reactions that would achieve the desired substitution pattern. 

So, considering the substituents: the ketone is a meta director, the nitro is a meta director, and bromine is a meta director. So each substituent directs the next to a meta position.

But wait, the ketone is the first substituent. Then, when adding the nitro group, it would go meta to the ketone. Then, adding Br would go meta to both. But wait, that's not possible because if the substituents are at 1 and 3 (ketone and nitro), adding Br would have to go to a position meta to both. But that might not be possible unless the structure allows.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is to first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone. But ketone introduction via Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. If the ring has nitro and bromine, which are deactivating, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So the ketone must be introduced early, preferably first, because after that, the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Introduce nitro group at the meta position relative to ketone (position 3)
3. Introduce bromine at the meta position relative to ketone (position 5)

Wait, but after step 2, adding nitro in position 3, then adding Br. However, the nitro group is a meta director, which would direct Br to position 5 (meta to nitro). But the ketone is also a meta director, which would direct Br to position 5 as well. So both substituents (nitro and ketone) would direct Br to the same position. So that would be possible.

So the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Nitration: acetophenone → 3-nitroacetophenone.

iii) Bromination: 3-nitroacetophenone → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone?

Wait, wait. Let me think. After acetophenone, when you nitrate, the nitro group goes into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, the next step is bromination. The ring now has ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). The nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go into position 6 (meta to nitro, which is position 3 → position 6 is meta? Wait, let me number the ring correctly.

Let me assign positions:

Positions around the benzene ring: 1 (ketone), 2, 3 (nitro), 4, 5, 6.

Each position is numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is at 1, nitro at 3, then bromine would go into a position that is meta to the nitro group, which is position 6. But wait, that's not position 5. So I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the substituents in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ketone, then the bromine, then the nitro. Let's see.

Step 1: Benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

Step 2: Bromination → Br at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: Nitration → nitro group at position 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br? Or meta to Br?)

Wait, when you have Br at position 3, which is a meta director. So nitration would occur meta to Br, which would be position 6. But we want nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs meta to the ketone, which is position 5. But after adding Br at position 3, would the nitration go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone? Let me think about the directing effects.

When the ring has multiple substituents, the most activating group (if any) will dictate the direction. But in this case, both Br and ketone are deactivating, so they are meta directors.

If the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3), then when nitrating, the possible positions are the ones meta to either substituent.

So position 5 is meta to ketone (1 → 3 and 5 are meta), and position 6 is meta to Br (3 → 6 is meta). So if nitration occurs, it could go to either 5 or 6. But in the target, we need nitro at 5. So perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromine is introduced. Alternatively, maybe the nitration happens first, then bromine, but that requires the ring to have the correct activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone)
3. Brominate → Br at position 5 (meta to ketone and meta to nitro?)

Wait, but with the ketone and nitro at 1 and 3, respectively, where would Br go?

If the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro), then for bromination, the Br would go into a position that's meta to either.

So the available positions are 5 (meta to ketone) and 6 (meta to nitro). So if both substituents are meta directors, the Br could go into either 5 or 6. But in the target, Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, no, wait the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, so substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), with the ketone at 1.

Wait, maybe this process is getting too tangled. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me see:

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine → phenylamine.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho/para to the amine. So the ketone would be added either in position 2 or 4 relative to the amine. But the target has the ketone in position 1, so maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me see:

Option D: i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group? Or perhaps a substitution with Br? Wait, what's the role of H3PO2 here?

Alternatively, maybe this is a way to introduce a Br. Wait, after diazotization, if we treat with H3PO2, perhaps it's a way to substitute the diazonium group with something else. Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Another possibility is that H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to form a bromine via a substitution reaction. But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps this is a step to form a bromine via some other mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: benzene → nitrobenzene → amine → diazonium salt → substitution to introduce Br.

So steps i to iv in option D would be:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → aniline.

iii) Diazotization → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution of diazonium group with Br. Wait, but usually, substitution with Br requires a copper catalyst, like CuBr. Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used in a different way. I'm a bit unsure about this step.

Assuming that step iv successfully replaces the diazonium group with Br, then we have bromobenzene with a nitro group. Wait, no: after reduction, the nitro becomes an amine. Diazotization converts amine to diazonium. Then substitution replaces diazonium with Br. So the product would be bromobenzene, but where is the nitro group?

Wait, no. The initial nitration is in benzene, so you have nitro group at position 1. Then, when you reduce it to amine, it's at position 1. Diazotization forms a diazonium at position 1. Substitution replaces that with Br, so now Br is at position 1. Hmm, but in the target, the Br is at position 3 relative to the ketone. So perhaps this isn't the right approach either.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and the possible synthesis steps. Since the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, which is at position 1.

So the ketone must be introduced first. Then, the next substituents should be added in the correct meta positions.

So the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) to add the ketone. Then, we need to add Br and NO2 in positions 3 and 5.

After adding the ketone, the ring is deactivated, so nitration and bromination will occur in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

So, after adding the ketone:

Step 2: Nitration would add the nitro group in the meta position (position 3 or 5).

Step 3: Bromination would add Br in the meta position (the other position).

But wait, what's the order of nitration and bromination? Let's say we nitrate first, so nitro is at 3. Then bromination would add Br at 5.

Alternatively, if we brominate first, Br would be at 3, then nitration would add nitro at 5.

So the correct sequence after the ketone is to either nitrate then brominate, or brominate then nitrate. Let's see.

In option A, the steps are:

i) Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) → ketone at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, where would nitration occur? The ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So the nitro group can go into position 5 (meta to ketone) or position 6 (meta to Br). But the target requires nitro at 5, which is meta to ketone. So nitration would indeed go to position 5.

Then the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

Wait, but what about the subsequent steps in option A:

iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step iii, we have the correct substituents. But then step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing condition. Maybe this is a step to reduce something, but what? The nitro group is at position 5. If we reduce it, it would become an amine. But in the target, we have a nitro group, so perhaps this step is not needed. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine option A.

Option A's steps:

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Br → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? But target has nitro, so that's a problem. So after step iii, the substituents are correct, but step iv reduces nitro to amine, which would change the structure. So that can't be correct. So the target has nitro, so steps that reduce nitro would be incorrect.

Therefore, option A's steps after step iii are incorrect because they involve steps that would alter the nitro group or other substituents. So option A is not the right one.

Looking again, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me check.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps substitution of diazonium group.

Wait, H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to form a hydroxyl group? Or to substitute with another group. I think it's used in the formation of phenols, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in the presence of a diazonium salt and H3PO2, maybe a bromine is introduced via the Sandmeyer reaction. Wait, no, the Sandmeyer uses CuX. H3PO2 is a different reagent.

Alternatively, H3PO2 is used to reduce certain groups, but in the context of a diazonium salt, perhaps it's used to form an amine again, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm recalling this incorrectly. Maybe H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to introduce a hydroxyl group via hydrolysis. But under acidic conditions, with H3PO2, perhaps it's more about the conditions.

Assuming that step iv is introducing a hydroxyl group via diazonium hydrolysis, then step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then step vi is CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but after step iv, you have a hydroxyl group. Then, step v is bromination. But with a hydroxyl group, which is a strong activating group, the bromination would occur in the ortho and para positions, which might not be what we want.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a substitution to introduce bromine. If step iv is using H3PO2 to substitute the diazonium group with Br, then you'd have Br in the position of the original amine.

So let's imagine:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → aniline (NH2 at position 1).

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at position 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br. So now, Br is at position 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But the ring now has Br at 1, which is a meta director. So the next Br would go into position 3 or 5. But the target only has one Br, so this would add an extra Br, which is not desired.

Hmm, that seems off. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Alternatively, let me think about option C.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Since amine is activating, the acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would occur at ortho and para positions to the amine.

So, the amine is at position 1. The acylation would add ketone at position 3 or 4 (ortho and para). But the target has the ketone at position 1, so this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. If the amine is at position 1, then the acylation would add the ketone at position 3 (meta to the ketone?) Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the target has the ketone at position 1, so the acylation step must introduce the ketone at position 1, which requires that the ring is activated. But if the ring already has an amine, which is activating, then the Friedel-Crafts can proceed. But the ketone would be added in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

So, if the amine is at position 1, and the ketone is added at position 3 (ortho) or 4 (para), then the ketone is not at position 1. Hence, this option doesn't lead to the correct product.

So perhaps option C is not correct either.

Wait, then perhaps option B is the correct one. Let's check again.

Option B steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, bromobenzene is a meta director, so nitration would occur at position 5 (assuming Br is at 1).

So after step ii, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 3.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating groups. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but the ring is deactivated. So acylation won't occur. Hence, this step would fail. So option B is incorrect.

Now, considering all options, perhaps option D is the right one, despite my confusion earlier.

Looking back at option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br, so Br is at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. With Br at 1 and nitro at 1 (now Br), but wait, no, the nitro was reduced to amine, then substituted with Br. So after step iv, the ring has Br at 1.

Wait, no. Let me retrace.

Option D step by step:

1. Benzene → nitro group at position 1 → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro (Fe/HCl) → aniline (NH2 at 1).

3. Diazotize (NaNO2/HCl) → diazonium chloride at 1.

4. Treat with H3PO2 → substitution reaction. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps this replaces the diazonium group with Br. So now, Br is at position 1.

5. Br2/FeBr3 → try to brominate. But with Br already at 1, which is a meta director, the next Br would go to position 3 or 5. But the target only has one Br, so this step would add another, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps step v is a nitration, but looking at option D, step v is Br2/FeBr3, so it's bromination again. So after step iv, the ring has Br at 1. Then step v adds another Br, which is not desired. Hence, option D doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the steps. Let me go back. The target has substituents at 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Nitration → nitro at 3.

3. Bromination → Br at 5.

But I'm not sure which option does that.

Looking at option B, step iii is acylation after Br and nitro. But that won't work because the ring is deactivated.

Option A: After acylation, steps are Br, nitration, then Fe/HCl, which reduces nitro. So that would give an amine, which is not desired.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination, but without any steps that alter the nitro group.

Looking back, none of the options seem to fit perfectly except perhaps option A, but that has steps after nitration that would alter the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to outline the correct steps:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitration to add NO2 at 3.

3. Bromination to add Br at 5.

Which steps would that correspond to? Let's see.

Looking for an option where the first three steps are:

i) Acylation.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Bromination.

Option A does have these steps in this order.

But then steps iv onward are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine? That's a problem.

So the target has nitro, but option A's steps would reduce it. So the steps after iii are incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but option D's steps might involve a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: the synthesis could involve directing the substituents through multiple steps, perhaps using meta directors to position the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but with a different interpretation of the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, but with a different understanding of step iv.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think about each option's steps and see which leads to the desired product.

Option A:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again? But where? The ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3, NH2 at 5.

Wait, but after step iv, the ring has NH2, so step v would nitrate it. NH2 is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur para to it. So nitro would go at position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by the ketone. So maybe nitration would go at position 3 or 5, but those are already occupied by Br and NH2. Not sure.

Option B:

i) Br at 1.

ii) Nitro at 3.

iii) Acetophenone can't be formed because the ring is deactivated.

So option B is out.

Option C:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Acetophenone at 3 or 4.

iv) Br at 3 or 5.

v) Nitro again?

Hmm, not matching.

Option D:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazonium at 1.

iv) Br at 1.

v) Br again? Unlikely.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option A, except that it has steps after the correct nitration which would alter the nitro group.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating option A. Let me think again.

Option A's steps after the nitration:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → re-nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → substitution.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps. Let's imagine:

After step iii, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

Step iv: reduce nitro (5) to NH2 (5).

Step v: nitration. The ring has ketone (1), Br (3), NH2 (5).

NH2 is an activating group, so nitration would occur para to it (position 1 is already taken), so maybe position 3. But position 3 has Br, so perhaps position 5 can't take another nitro. Hmm, this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are incorrect beyond step iii.

Given that, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I must choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct sequence is acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. Let me see which option does that.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetylation → ketone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

Then, the target is achieved. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) in option A might be superfluous or incorrect. But the question is about the correct sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the steps in option A are correct up to step iii, and the rest are not needed. But the question includes all steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are incorrect because after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, but then steps iv onward alter them. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me think again.

Option D: steps are i to vii as follows.

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazonium at 1.

iv) Br at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate again. Maybe here, the ring has Br at 1 and another Br at 3.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But if the ring has two Brs and a nitro, it's highly deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this is impossible.

So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in option A, after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, and the rest of the steps are for something else. But the target has nitro, so steps that alter nitro are a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's sequence leading to the target.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone. So the substituents are at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3).

The correct order is:

1. Acetophenone (COCH3 at 1).

2. Nitration → NO2 at 3 (meta to COCH3).

3. Bromination → Br at 5 (meta to COCH3).

Which steps correspond to this?

Looking at the options:

Option A does this correctly with steps i, ii, iii. So after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents.

But then steps iv to vii in option A are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → substitution.

But in the target, we need nitro, so steps iv and v would alter it. So option A is incorrect, as it reduces the nitro group.

Looking again, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me think again.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction → NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br → Br at 1.

v) Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to Br at 1).

vi) Acetylation → COCH3 at position 5 (meta to Br at 1? Or where?)

Wait, after step iv, the ring has Br at 1. Step v is bromination, which would add Br at 3 or 5 (meta to Br at 1). Then, step vi is acetylation. But with Br and another Br (position 3 or 5), the ring is deactivated. So acetylation won't occur. Hence, this is not possible.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option A. Even though after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, the subsequent steps might not be needed or are incorrect, but the first three steps are correct. But the question asks which sequence leads to the high-yield synthesis, so perhaps the answer is option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The substituents must be introduced in a specific order to ensure they occupy the correct positions relative to each other. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone).
   - At this point, the target structure is achieved with the ketone at 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂. These steps are unnecessary and would alter the structure, as they reduce the nitro group or introduce additional substituents, which are not desired for the target molecule.

### Option B:
1. **Step i**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated due to the presence of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups are already present.

### Option C:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone. However, the amine is a strong activating group, directing the ketone to the ortho or para positions relative to itself, not position 1.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced at position 1.

### Option D:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ substitutes the diazonium group with bromine, introducing bromine at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds another bromine at position 3 (meta to bromine at 1).
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated due to the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups are already present.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the most plausible sequence. Steps i–iii correctly introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions. However, steps iv–vii are unnecessary and would alter the structure, making them unsuitable for the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. Despite this, none of the options perfectly match the desired sequence, and Option A is the closest.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reaction steps. 

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is a ketone. So the structure should be a benzene ring with substituents attached. The substituents are a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, but wait—phenyl groups are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So for benzene, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone? Or is the ketone part attached in a certain way?

Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one), but when it's attached to a benzene ring, it's typically as a ketone group. So the benzene ring is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) as a substituent. So the molecule is acetophenone with additional substituents. 

Wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone (C=O) attached. So in this case, the ketone is on the benzene ring, and there are two other substituents: bromine and nitro groups. So the positions would be relative to the ketone. Let's think: the ketone is in position 1. Then the bromine is in position 3, and the nitro in position 5. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (C=O), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but when you number the ring, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So the numbering is such that the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5. 

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine would be two carbons away (positions 3), and nitro at 5, which is four away? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the positions are 3 and 5 relative to each other. Let me draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So the benzene ring would look like this: positions 1 (C=O), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So that's a meta arrangement between Br and NO2. But wait, the positions are 1,3,5 on the benzene ring. Wait, that would make the substituents all at every other position, so that's possible.

Wait, but wait a minute. The compound is named 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents on the phenyl group are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (the ketone). So the acetophenone part is the ketone attached to the benzene (the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon). So the benzene ring has the ketone at position 1 (let's say), bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So that's a meta arrangement between Br and NO2, and both are para to the ketone? Or wait, no—position 3 and 5 are meta to each other, but each is para to the ketone (since 1 is attached to the ketone, 3 is two positions away, so meta). So the ketone is at 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5. So the three substituents (C=O, Br, NO2) are all on the benzene ring at positions 1,3,5. So that gives a symmetrical arrangement? Or maybe not, but that's the structure.

Now, the goal is to start with benzene and go through a series of reactions to get this compound. The options give different sequences, each with several steps. Each step is a reaction condition, so I need to figure out which sequence correctly builds the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the typical reactions used to introduce substituents on benzene. The main pathways are nitration, bromination, acetylation (using acetyl chloride or similar), and perhaps some reduction steps.

But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is the first substituent introduced, and then the others are added in the correct positions.

But wait, introducing substituents on benzene is tricky because once you add one group, the next substitution will occur in a certain position relative to it, depending on directing effects.

So let's think about the directing effects of different groups. Nitro groups are meta directors. Bromine is typically a meta director as well, unless it's part of a leaving group scenario (like in aromatic substitution where it's a leaving group, but I think in this case, Br is a substituent, so it's a meta director).

But wait, wait. When you introduce a nitro group, it's a strong meta-directing group. When you introduce a Br, it's a meta director as well. Acetophenone (the ketone) is a strong activating group? No, wait: the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group, and it's meta directing. So when the ketone is attached, it will direct incoming substituents to the meta positions.

So the plan is to first introduce the ketone (since it's a meta director), then introduce the nitro group, and then the bromine in the correct positions.

Wait, but the target has both Br and NO2 on the ring, so maybe the order of adding these substituents matters. Let me think.

So, step 1: Benzene to acetophenone. How is that done? Acetophenone is usually made by Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene reacts with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. So step 1 would be CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Once the ketone is on the ring, the next substituents must be added in the meta positions relative to the ketone. But wait, the target has two substituents: Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, but wait, the ketone is at position 1. Then, the nitro would be at position 3 (meta to ketone), and Br at position 5 (which is also meta to ketone but in a different position). Or is the nitro in position 5 relative to the ketone, which is also meta?

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the positions again. The benzene ring is a six-membered ring. Let's imagine the acetophenone is at position 1. Then, meta positions are 3 and 5. So adding substituents in positions 3 and 5 would require that we add each substituent in the correct order.

But wait, nitration is a reaction that can be directed by the existing substituent. So after acetophenone is formed, the next substituent will go into the meta position. Let's say we nitrate the acetophenone next. So the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5?

Wait, when you have a meta director, incoming substituents can go into any of the available meta positions. So if the ketone is at position 1, the available meta positions are 3 and 5. Depending on the reaction conditions, the nitro group could go into either. But for the target molecule, it's specifically 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So perhaps the nitro group is at position 5, and the bromine is at position 3. Or vice versa.

Wait, but the target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the ketone.

So the plan is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation)
2. Introduce nitro group in position 5 (meta to ketone)
3. Introduce bromine in position 3 (meta to ketone)

Wait, but wait: after the ketone is introduced, the next substituent will go into a meta position. Let's say we nitrate next. Then the nitro group would be at position 3 or 5. But in the target, it's 5-nitro. Hmm, perhaps that's not the order. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is added before the nitro group.

But wait, wait—another approach. Let's think about the possible steps in each option. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: The steps are i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let's see. So step i is Friedel-Crafts to add the ketone. Then step ii is bromination with FeBr3, which is a typical bromination (electrophilic substitution). So after the ketone is added, Br would enter at the meta position. Then step iii is nitration. So after adding Br, nitrating would depend on where the Br is directing.

Wait, but after adding Br, which is a meta director, the nitration would happen at the meta position relative to Br. But wait, the initial substituent is the ketone, then Br, then nitro. Hmm, maybe this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, let's think about the target molecule: substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1. So we need Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So the first substituent is the ketone. Then, the next substituent can be either Br or nitro in position 3, and the other in position 5.

But the order in which we add substituents affects where each goes. Let's see.

If we first add Br, after the ketone. Since the ketone is meta director, Br would go into position 3 (meta to ketone). Then, nitration would occur.

Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Then, when we nitrate, the nitro group will be directed by the existing substituents. Since Br is a meta director, but the ketone is also a meta director. So where would the nitro group go? Hmm.

Wait, when multiple substituents are present, the directing effect is determined by the most activating group, but since both Br and ketone are deactivating (met directors), the nitro group would enter where possible.

Wait, perhaps in a situation with two meta directors, the incoming group goes into the position that is meta to both, but that's not possible unless the substituents are arranged in a way that allows that. Alternatively, the substituent with the strongest directing effect may dominate. But since both are meta directors, perhaps the nitro group would enter at position 5, which is meta relative to the ketone and para to the Br.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option.

Option B: Steps are i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that starts with bromination of benzene. So benzene → bromobenzene. Then nitration (adds nitro group as next substituent). Then acylation. Hmm, but acylation requires Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. But bromobenzene is deactivated; Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's a problem. So option B is probably incorrect because after adding Br and nitro (both meta directors), trying to do Friedel-Crafts would fail because the ring is too deactivated. So option B is unlikely.

Option C: Steps are i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm. Starts with nitration of benzene. So benzene → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl—maybe a reduction? Wait, Fe/HCl is a reducing condition, perhaps for the nitro group. Nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine. So step ii would turn nitro into amine. Then step iii is acylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. An amine is strongly activating, so acylation would occur. So acylation of aniline would add a ketone group. But wait, the amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur in the para and ortho positions relative to the amine. But we want the ketone in the position that will direct the other substituents correctly. Hmm, but if we have the amine and then acylation, the ketone would be in the para position relative to the amine. So the nitro group is first, which is meta directing. Then, after reduction, you have an amine, which is ortho/para directing. Then acylation would add the ketone in para to the amine. That might complicate things.

Wait, if the initial steps are nitration (nitro group), then reduction to amine, then Friedel-Crafts acylation. So the ring would have amine and ketone. But wait, Friedel-Crafts can't be done on a ring with an amine because the amine is a strong activating group, but also, after acylation, the ring now has a ketone (deactivating) and an amine (activating). Then step iv is bromination with FeBr3. Now, with both a ketone and an amine, where would the Br go? The amine is ortho/para director, the ketone is meta. So perhaps the Br would go into a position directed by the amine, but perhaps in this scenario, it's possible.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the positions again. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone. So the acetone is in position 1, bromine in 3, nitro in 5. So in this option, after nitration, reduction, acylation, and bromination, would the substituents end up correctly?

Alternatively, maybe this isn't the right approach. Let me look at option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, this starts with nitration again. So benzene → nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine, making phenylamine. Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → this is a diazotization step, typically done at low temps. Then step iv: H3PO2. Oh wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, and in the presence of a diazonium salt, it can do a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but wait, no, H3PO2 is used for reductive elimination, perhaps for introducing Br or Cl. Wait, wait—another possibility: after diazotization, if you treat with H3PO2, it might lead to hydroxylation. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I might be getting this wrong. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, with H2O (acidic), it's hydrolysis to phenol. With CuCN, it's cyanation. With CuX (X=I, Br, Cl), it's substitution to introduce X. So if we have step iii as diazotization, then step iv is H3PO2, which is a reagent used in the thiocyanate reaction or perhaps in the production of amines. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up with other reagents. Alternatively, perhaps this is a step to form a bromine substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization (step iii), the phenol is formed in step iv. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used to reduce certain groups, like in the Birch reduction. Hmm.

This seems complicated. Let me think about the overall approach. The target molecule has three substituents on benzene: C=O, Br, and NO2. The substituents are at positions 1,3,5. So the order of adding substituents probably needs to control where each goes.

But perhaps another approach is to determine the correct order of reactions that would achieve the desired substitution pattern. 

So, considering the substituents: the ketone is a meta director, the nitro is a meta director, and bromine is a meta director. So each substituent directs the next to a meta position.

But wait, the ketone is the first substituent. Then, when adding the nitro group, it would go meta to the ketone. Then, adding Br would go meta to both. But wait, that's not possible because if the substituents are at 1 and 3 (ketone and nitro), adding Br would have to go to a position meta to both. But that might not be possible unless the structure allows.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is to first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone. But ketone introduction via Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. If the ring has nitro and bromine, which are deactivating, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So the ketone must be introduced early, preferably first, because after that, the ring is deactivated.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Introduce nitro group at the meta position relative to ketone (position 3)
3. Introduce bromine at the meta position relative to ketone (position 5)

Wait, but after step 2, adding nitro in position 3, then adding Br. However, the nitro group is a meta director, which would direct Br to position 5 (meta to nitro). But the ketone is also a meta director, which would direct Br to position 5 as well. So both substituents (nitro and ketone) would direct Br to the same position. So that would be possible.

So the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Nitration: acetophenone → 3-nitroacetophenone.

iii) Bromination: 3-nitroacetophenone → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone?

Wait, wait. Let me think. After acetophenone, when you nitrate, the nitro group goes into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, the next step is bromination. The ring now has ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). The nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go into position 6 (meta to nitro, which is position 3 → position 6 is meta? Wait, let me number the ring correctly.

Let me assign positions:

Positions around the benzene ring: 1 (ketone), 2, 3 (nitro), 4, 5, 6.

Each position is numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is at 1, nitro at 3, then bromine would go into a position that is meta to the nitro group, which is position 6. But wait, that's not position 5. So I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the substituents in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ketone, then the bromine, then the nitro. Let's see.

Step 1: Benzene → acetophenone (position 1).

Step 2: Bromination → Br at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: Nitration → nitro group at position 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br? Or meta to Br?)

Wait, when you have Br at position 3, which is a meta director. So nitration would occur meta to Br, which would be position 6. But we want nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs meta to the ketone, which is position 5. But after adding Br at position 3, would the nitration go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone? Let me think about the directing effects.

When the ring has multiple substituents, the most activating group (if any) will dictate the direction. But in this case, both Br and ketone are deactivating, so they are meta directors.

If the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3), then when nitrating, the possible positions are the ones meta to either substituent.

So position 5 is meta to ketone (1 → 3 and 5 are meta), and position 6 is meta to Br (3 → 6 is meta). So if nitration occurs, it could go to either 5 or 6. But in the target, we need nitro at 5. So perhaps the nitration occurs before the bromine is introduced. Alternatively, maybe the nitration happens first, then bromine, but that requires the ring to have the correct activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Benzene → acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (meta to ketone)
3. Brominate → Br at position 5 (meta to ketone and meta to nitro?)

Wait, but with the ketone and nitro at 1 and 3, respectively, where would Br go?

If the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro), then for bromination, the Br would go into a position that's meta to either.

So the available positions are 5 (meta to ketone) and 6 (meta to nitro). So if both substituents are meta directors, the Br could go into either 5 or 6. But in the target, Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, no, wait the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, so substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), with the ketone at 1.

Wait, maybe this process is getting too tangled. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me see:

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine → phenylamine.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, amine is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur ortho/para to the amine. So the ketone would be added either in position 2 or 4 relative to the amine. But the target has the ketone in position 1, so maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me see:

Option D: i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → forms diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe hydrolysis to form a hydroxyl group? Or perhaps a substitution with Br? Wait, what's the role of H3PO2 here?

Alternatively, maybe this is a way to introduce a Br. Wait, after diazotization, if we treat with H3PO2, perhaps it's a way to substitute the diazonium group with something else. Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Another possibility is that H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to form a bromine via a substitution reaction. But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps this is a step to form a bromine via some other mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: benzene → nitrobenzene → amine → diazonium salt → substitution to introduce Br.

So steps i to iv in option D would be:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → aniline.

iii) Diazotization → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution of diazonium group with Br. Wait, but usually, substitution with Br requires a copper catalyst, like CuBr. Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used in a different way. I'm a bit unsure about this step.

Assuming that step iv successfully replaces the diazonium group with Br, then we have bromobenzene with a nitro group. Wait, no: after reduction, the nitro becomes an amine. Diazotization converts amine to diazonium. Then substitution replaces diazonium with Br. So the product would be bromobenzene, but where is the nitro group?

Wait, no. The initial nitration is in benzene, so you have nitro group at position 1. Then, when you reduce it to amine, it's at position 1. Diazotization forms a diazonium at position 1. Substitution replaces that with Br, so now Br is at position 1. Hmm, but in the target, the Br is at position 3 relative to the ketone. So perhaps this isn't the right approach either.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the target molecule and the possible synthesis steps. Since the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone, which is at position 1.

So the ketone must be introduced first. Then, the next substituents should be added in the correct meta positions.

So the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) to add the ketone. Then, we need to add Br and NO2 in positions 3 and 5.

After adding the ketone, the ring is deactivated, so nitration and bromination will occur in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

So, after adding the ketone:

Step 2: Nitration would add the nitro group in the meta position (position 3 or 5).

Step 3: Bromination would add Br in the meta position (the other position).

But wait, what's the order of nitration and bromination? Let's say we nitrate first, so nitro is at 3. Then bromination would add Br at 5.

Alternatively, if we brominate first, Br would be at 3, then nitration would add nitro at 5.

So the correct sequence after the ketone is to either nitrate then brominate, or brominate then nitrate. Let's see.

In option A, the steps are:

i) Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) → ketone at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination, Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, where would nitration occur? The ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So the nitro group can go into position 5 (meta to ketone) or position 6 (meta to Br). But the target requires nitro at 5, which is meta to ketone. So nitration would indeed go to position 5.

Then the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). Which matches the target.

Wait, but what about the subsequent steps in option A:

iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, after step iii, we have the correct substituents. But then step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing condition. Maybe this is a step to reduce something, but what? The nitro group is at position 5. If we reduce it, it would become an amine. But in the target, we have a nitro group, so perhaps this step is not needed. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine option A.

Option A's steps:

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Br → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine? But target has nitro, so that's a problem. So after step iii, the substituents are correct, but step iv reduces nitro to amine, which would change the structure. So that can't be correct. So the target has nitro, so steps that reduce nitro would be incorrect.

Therefore, option A's steps after step iii are incorrect because they involve steps that would alter the nitro group or other substituents. So option A is not the right one.

Looking again, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let me check.

Option D's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps substitution of diazonium group.

Wait, H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to form a hydroxyl group? Or to substitute with another group. I think it's used in the formation of phenols, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in the presence of a diazonium salt and H3PO2, maybe a bromine is introduced via the Sandmeyer reaction. Wait, no, the Sandmeyer uses CuX. H3PO2 is a different reagent.

Alternatively, H3PO2 is used to reduce certain groups, but in the context of a diazonium salt, perhaps it's used to form an amine again, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm recalling this incorrectly. Maybe H3PO2 is used in the presence of a diazonium salt to introduce a hydroxyl group via hydrolysis. But under acidic conditions, with H3PO2, perhaps it's more about the conditions.

Assuming that step iv is introducing a hydroxyl group via diazonium hydrolysis, then step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Then step vi is CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but after step iv, you have a hydroxyl group. Then, step v is bromination. But with a hydroxyl group, which is a strong activating group, the bromination would occur in the ortho and para positions, which might not be what we want.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is a substitution to introduce bromine. If step iv is using H3PO2 to substitute the diazonium group with Br, then you'd have Br in the position of the original amine.

So let's imagine:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → aniline (NH2 at position 1).

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at position 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br. So now, Br is at position 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But the ring now has Br at 1, which is a meta director. So the next Br would go into position 3 or 5. But the target only has one Br, so this would add an extra Br, which is not desired.

Hmm, that seems off. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Alternatively, let me think about option C.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. Since amine is activating, the acylation (Friedel-Crafts) would occur at ortho and para positions to the amine.

So, the amine is at position 1. The acylation would add ketone at position 3 or 4 (ortho and para). But the target has the ketone at position 1, so this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. If the amine is at position 1, then the acylation would add the ketone at position 3 (meta to the ketone?) Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, the target has the ketone at position 1, so the acylation step must introduce the ketone at position 1, which requires that the ring is activated. But if the ring already has an amine, which is activating, then the Friedel-Crafts can proceed. But the ketone would be added in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

So, if the amine is at position 1, and the ketone is added at position 3 (ortho) or 4 (para), then the ketone is not at position 1. Hence, this option doesn't lead to the correct product.

So perhaps option C is not correct either.

Wait, then perhaps option B is the correct one. Let's check again.

Option B steps:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, bromobenzene is a meta director, so nitration would occur at position 5 (assuming Br is at 1).

So after step ii, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 3.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating groups. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but the ring is deactivated. So acylation won't occur. Hence, this step would fail. So option B is incorrect.

Now, considering all options, perhaps option D is the right one, despite my confusion earlier.

Looking back at option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br, so Br is at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. With Br at 1 and nitro at 1 (now Br), but wait, no, the nitro was reduced to amine, then substituted with Br. So after step iv, the ring has Br at 1.

Wait, no. Let me retrace.

Option D step by step:

1. Benzene → nitro group at position 1 → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro (Fe/HCl) → aniline (NH2 at 1).

3. Diazotize (NaNO2/HCl) → diazonium chloride at 1.

4. Treat with H3PO2 → substitution reaction. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps this replaces the diazonium group with Br. So now, Br is at position 1.

5. Br2/FeBr3 → try to brominate. But with Br already at 1, which is a meta director, the next Br would go to position 3 or 5. But the target only has one Br, so this step would add another, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps step v is a nitration, but looking at option D, step v is Br2/FeBr3, so it's bromination again. So after step iv, the ring has Br at 1. Then step v adds another Br, which is not desired. Hence, option D doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the steps. Let me go back. The target has substituents at 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Nitration → nitro at 3.

3. Bromination → Br at 5.

But I'm not sure which option does that.

Looking at option B, step iii is acylation after Br and nitro. But that won't work because the ring is deactivated.

Option A: After acylation, steps are Br, nitration, then Fe/HCl, which reduces nitro. So that would give an amine, which is not desired.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, then nitration, then bromination, but without any steps that alter the nitro group.

Looking back, none of the options seem to fit perfectly except perhaps option A, but that has steps after nitration that would alter the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to outline the correct steps:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Nitration to add NO2 at 3.

3. Bromination to add Br at 5.

Which steps would that correspond to? Let's see.

Looking for an option where the first three steps are:

i) Acylation.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Bromination.

Option A does have these steps in this order.

But then steps iv onward are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine? That's a problem.

So the target has nitro, but option A's steps would reduce it. So the steps after iii are incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are perfect, but option D's steps might involve a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: the synthesis could involve directing the substituents through multiple steps, perhaps using meta directors to position the substituents correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but with a different interpretation of the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, but with a different understanding of step iv.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to think about each option's steps and see which leads to the desired product.

Option A:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br at 3.

iii) Nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again? But where? The ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3, NH2 at 5.

Wait, but after step iv, the ring has NH2, so step v would nitrate it. NH2 is a strong activating group, so nitration would occur para to it. So nitro would go at position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by the ketone. So maybe nitration would go at position 3 or 5, but those are already occupied by Br and NH2. Not sure.

Option B:

i) Br at 1.

ii) Nitro at 3.

iii) Acetophenone can't be formed because the ring is deactivated.

So option B is out.

Option C:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Acetophenone at 3 or 4.

iv) Br at 3 or 5.

v) Nitro again?

Hmm, not matching.

Option D:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazonium at 1.

iv) Br at 1.

v) Br again? Unlikely.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option A, except that it has steps after the correct nitration which would alter the nitro group.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating option A. Let me think again.

Option A's steps after the nitration:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → re-nitration.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → substitution.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps. Let's imagine:

After step iii, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

Step iv: reduce nitro (5) to NH2 (5).

Step v: nitration. The ring has ketone (1), Br (3), NH2 (5).

NH2 is an activating group, so nitration would occur para to it (position 1 is already taken), so maybe position 3. But position 3 has Br, so perhaps position 5 can't take another nitro. Hmm, this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are incorrect beyond step iii.

Given that, perhaps none of the options are correct, but I must choose the best fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct sequence is acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. Let me see which option does that.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetylation → ketone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

Then, the target is achieved. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) in option A might be superfluous or incorrect. But the question is about the correct sequence leading to the target, so perhaps the steps in option A are correct up to step iii, and the rest are not needed. But the question includes all steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option A are incorrect because after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, but then steps iv onward alter them. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D. Let me think again.

Option D: steps are i to vii as follows.

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazonium at 1.

iv) Br at 1.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate again. Maybe here, the ring has Br at 1 and another Br at 3.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But if the ring has two Brs and a nitro, it's highly deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So this is impossible.

So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe in option A, after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, and the rest of the steps are for something else. But the target has nitro, so steps that alter nitro are a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's sequence leading to the target.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl acetone. So the substituents are at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3).

The correct order is:

1. Acetophenone (COCH3 at 1).

2. Nitration → NO2 at 3 (meta to COCH3).

3. Bromination → Br at 5 (meta to COCH3).

Which steps correspond to this?

Looking at the options:

Option A does this correctly with steps i, ii, iii. So after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents.

But then steps iv to vii in option A are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → substitution.

But in the target, we need nitro, so steps iv and v would alter it. So option A is incorrect, as it reduces the nitro group.

Looking again, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me think again.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction → NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotization → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → substitution with Br → Br at 1.

v) Bromination → Br at 3 (meta to Br at 1).

vi) Acetylation → COCH3 at position 5 (meta to Br at 1? Or where?)

Wait, after step iv, the ring has Br at 1. Step v is bromination, which would add Br at 3 or 5 (meta to Br at 1). Then, step vi is acetylation. But with Br and another Br (position 3 or 5), the ring is deactivated. So acetylation won't occur. Hence, this is not possible.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option A. Even though after step iii, the ring has the correct substituents, the subsequent steps might not be needed or are incorrect, but the first three steps are correct. But the question asks which sequence leads to the high-yield synthesis, so perhaps the answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. The substituents must be introduced in a specific order to ensure they occupy the correct positions relative to each other. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Option A:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone).
   - At this point, the target structure is achieved with the ketone at 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These involve Fe/HCl, HNO₃/H₂SO₄, NaNO₂/HCl, and H₃PO₂. These steps are unnecessary and would alter the structure, as they reduce the nitro group or introduce additional substituents, which are not desired for the target molecule.

### Option B:
1. **Step i**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 3 (meta to bromine).
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated due to the presence of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups are already present.

### Option C:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ introduces the ketone. However, the amine is a strong activating group, directing the ketone to the ortho or para positions relative to itself, not position 1.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced at position 1.

### Option D:
1. **Step i**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
4. **Step iv**: H₃PO₂ substitutes the diazonium group with bromine, introducing bromine at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds another bromine at position 3 (meta to bromine at 1).
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ attempts to introduce the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated due to the bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups are already present.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the most plausible sequence. Steps i–iii correctly introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions. However, steps iv–vii are unnecessary and would alter the structure, making them unsuitable for the high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. Despite this, none of the options perfectly match the desired sequence, and Option A is the closest.

ANSWER: A
