Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices come up in things like the Pauli equation or maybe in certain interactions, perhaps axial currents or something. But that's maybe not the main point here.

The question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. So, I need to determine [κ]_M and then see if the theory is renormalizable based on that.

First, I should recall how to find the mass dimension of a coupling constant in a Lagrangian. The idea is that the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c =1), so ∫ d^4x L must be dimensionless. Thus, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in L_int must have dimension 4. Let's look at the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let me figure out the dimensions of each part. Let's list the fields and their dimensions.

In four dimensions, the fields have the following mass dimensions:
- Spinor field ψ: mass dimension 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The kinetic term must have dimension 4. Each ∂_μ has dimension 1, and ψ has dimension 3/2. So i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ has dimension (3/2)*2 + 1 = 4. So yes, ψ is 3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The gauge field A has dimension 1, so the field strength F, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, would have dimension 2. Because each derivative adds 1, and each A is dimension 1. So F is 2.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], so it's built from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is a tensor made from gamma matrices, but its dimension comes from the structure. Since it's constructed from terms involving γ matrices (which are dimensionless) and the commutator, so σ itself is dimensionless. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the sigma tensor is made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Or wait, is it? Let me think. Oh, because sigma is [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which are both dimensionless, so σ is also dimensionless. So the sigma term doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

So now, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let's compute the dimension of each part:

ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3, because sigma is dimensionless. Then F has dimension 2. So the entire term is κ multiplied by (3) * (2) = 6. So the term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So:

[κ] * (3 + 2) = 4? Wait, wait no. Wait, no, each factor in the product contributes their dimensions.

Wait, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. Thus, the entire term has dimension [κ] + 6 = 4. So [κ] must be 4 -6 = -2? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the possible dimensions are 1 or -1. Did I make a mistake here.

Wait, another approach: The Lagrangian terms must have dimension 4. So each field in the term contributes their own dimension, and the coupling constant (κ in this case) must adjust to make the product dimension 4.

So the term is κ times ψ̄ (dim 3/2) times σ_{μν} (dim 0) times ψ (dim 3/2) times F^{μν} (dim 2). So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. So the product of the fields is 9/2. Then κ must have mass dimension 4 - (9/2) = 4 -4.5= -0.5? Hmm, but that's -1/2, which isn't any of the options either. That can't be right. Did I mess up the math?

Wait, let me recalculate:

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless, so contributes 0. F has dimension 2. So the term is:

κ * (ψ̄) * (σ) * (ψ) * F

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

(3/2) * (3/2) is 9/4. Multiply by 2: 9/4 * 2 = 9/2. So the fields contribute 9/2. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so [κ] must be 4 - (9/2) = (8/2 -9/2) = -1/2. Hmm, which is -0.5. But the options are -1 and 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dimension of F. Let me think again. F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1, since in the Maxwell Lagrangian, L is like F^2, which has dimension 4 (since F is dimension 2). Wait, Maxwell's Lagrangian is (1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}, so each F is dimension 2. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of fields. Let's see: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So that's 4 fields: two ψ's (each 3/2), one F (2). Wait, ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. So same as before. So what's the mistake here?

Wait, maybe the term is actually ψ̄ σ^{μν} ψ F_{μν}, right? So the sigma is antisymmetric, but the F is also antisymmetric. So the term is scalar, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each factor. The term is:

κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}

So each ψ is 3/2, σ is dimensionless, F is 2. So the fields contribute (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. Wait, but that's not correct because 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the fields contribute 5, but the coupling is κ, so the entire term must be 4.

So [κ] +5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

Oh! Wait, I think I messed up the approach. The term is a product of fields, so each field's dimension adds. So each ψ (ψ̄ and ψ) is 3/2 each, F is 2, and σ is dimensionless.

So the fields' total dimension is 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3 +2 =5.

So the term is κ multiplied by the product, so [κ] +5 must equal 4 (since each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M is -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that would make option A or C possible.

Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling's mass dimension. The rule is that a theory with coupling dimension [g]_M ≥ 0 is renormalizable. If [g]_M <0, it's nonrenormalizable (and typically a higher-dimensional operator, requiring a UV completion).

In this case, [κ]=-1. So that's less than zero. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So combining the two results: [κ]_M is -1, theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, let me double-check. So the options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable → No because [κ]=-1 <0.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable → [κ]=1>0 → renormalizable, but our calculation says [κ]=-1, so B is out.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → Correct.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable → No, since [κ] is -1.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) for a gauge field has mass dimension \( [F]_M = 2 \).
- The tensor \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), so it is also dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. The fields contribute the following dimensions:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) has the same dimension as \( \psi \): \( [\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \psi \) has dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension \( [F]_M = 2 \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).

The total dimension of the field product is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
The coupling constant \( \kappa \) must ensure the entire term has dimension 4. Thus:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension (\( [g]_M \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as derived above.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Answer: C**

[κ] * (3 + 2) = 4? Wait, wait no. Wait, no, each factor in the product contributes their dimensions.

Wait, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. Thus, the entire term has dimension [κ] + 6 = 4. So [κ] must be 4 -6 = -2? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the possible dimensions are 1 or -1. Did I make a mistake here.

So the product of the fields is 9/2. Then κ must have mass dimension 4 - (9/2) = 4 -4.5= -0.5? Hmm, but that's -1/2, which isn't any of the options either. That can't be right. Did I mess up the math?

Wait, let me recalculate:

Each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless, so contributes 0. F has dimension 2. So the term is:

κ * (ψ̄) * (σ) * (ψ) * F

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

(3/2) * (3/2) is 9/4. Multiply by 2: 9/4 * 2 = 9/2. So the fields contribute 9/2. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so [κ] must be 4 - (9/2) = (8/2 -9/2) = -1/2. Hmm, which is -0.5. But the options are -1 and 1.

So [κ] +5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

Oh! Wait, I think I messed up the approach. The term is a product of fields, so each field's dimension adds. So each ψ (ψ̄ and ψ) is 3/2 each, F is 2, and σ is dimensionless.

So the fields' total dimension is 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3 +2 =5.

So the term is κ multiplied by the product, so [κ] +5 must equal 4 (since each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4). So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M is -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So that would make option A or C possible.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → Correct.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable → No, since [κ] is -1.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The spinor field \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) for a gauge field has mass dimension \( [F]_M = 2 \).
- The tensor \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), so it is also dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. The fields contribute the following dimensions:
- \( \bar{\psi} \) has the same dimension as \( \psi \): \( [\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( \psi \) has dimension \( [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} \).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has dimension \( [F]_M = 2 \).
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless: \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0 \).

The total dimension of the field product is:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
The coupling constant \( \kappa \) must ensure the entire term has dimension 4. Thus:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension (\( [g]_M \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as derived above.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa]_M = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \), not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable.
