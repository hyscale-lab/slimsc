Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll probably have to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy to pick the right choice.

Wait, okay, relative velocity in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. I remember that it's given by the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/c²), but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity of the second with respect to the first would be (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)) but since v1 is larger, the relative speed is v1 - v2 divided by some factor.

Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the frame where the other is moving at v. Oh wait, I think I might have it backwards.

Actually, the relative speed of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c) as seen from the first astronaut's (moving at 0.6c) frame would be u = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. The magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's one part down.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². Wait, but each has their own mass. So for each, I need to calculate their gamma factor, multiply by their mass, and sum the energies.

Wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut moving at 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

The second astronaut moves at 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.4641, so about 3.4641 mc².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 = approximately 5.9641 mc². So the total energy is around 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc². Hmm, so the calculations point towards option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Oh wait, because the relative speed is actually the speed of one from the other's frame. Let me recalculate that.

So, when you have two objects moving at u and v in the same direction, the relative speed u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, but u is the speed of the second as seen from the first's frame, or vice versa?

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the first's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

So the correct option should have v_rel = 0.14c and E ≈5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D is E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed Calculation
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The magnitude of the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy Calculation
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
