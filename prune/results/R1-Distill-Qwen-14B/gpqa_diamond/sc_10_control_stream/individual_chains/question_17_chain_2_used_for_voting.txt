Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's that again? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent—it binds to metal ions. So Ca-EDTA is a complex where EDTA wraps around the calcium ion, forming a stable complex.

The question is asking about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh, so it's not just the concentration of the complex, but the free Ca²+ ions. Right, because some of the EDTA might dissociate, releasing Ca²+.

The given data includes the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 5x10^10. And the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that's too relevant here since K is already given.

So, I remember that the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA form the complex. The formula is something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when you have the complex, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, let me think. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that each complex released one Ca²+ and one EDTA. But wait, is the stoichiometry 1:1? I think Ca-EDTA is a 1:1 complex, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-, forming the complex.

So the initial concentrations are:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (initially, but x will form)
[EDTA^4-] = 0 (initially, but x forms)

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, right? Because K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the reaction favors the product. So the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x is approximately zero compared to 0.02. Therefore, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.)

So, the K expression becomes:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])
=> 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x)
=> 5e10 = 0.02 / x²
Hmm, solving for x.

So rearrange: x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-14 / 1e1 (wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12.

So 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7?

Wait, wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13). 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that math right. Let's compute:

x² = (0.02) / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = (sqrt(4)) * (sqrt(1e-13)) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me look at the options.

Options are:
A) 2.0x10^-2 M
B)5.0x10^-3
C)6.3x10^-7
D)1.0x10^-2

So option C matches the calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I set up the equation correctly?

Because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and the formation constant given is for the complex. Yes, but the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So because K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] is very low.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation equation.

Another approach: the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The dissociation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

But, since [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x (because each dissociation gives one of each), then:

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Which is the same calculation as before.

So yes, x is about 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation equilibrium is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

At equilibrium:
- The concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( K \) is very large, dissociation is minimal).
- The concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options:

- **A)** \( 2.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \) — Incorrect, too large.
- **B)** \( 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \) — Incorrect, too large.
- **C)** \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \) — Correct.
- **D)** \( 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \) — Incorrect, too large.

The correct answer is **C**.

So, I remember that the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA form the complex. The formula is something like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, when you have the complex, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

At equilibrium, let me think. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate.

I think Ca-EDTA is a 1:1 complex, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-, forming the complex.

So the initial concentrations are:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] = 0 (initially, but x will form)
[EDTA^4-] = 0 (initially, but x forms)

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be very small, right? Because K is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the reaction favors the product. So the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x is approximately zero compared to 0.02. Therefore, [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.)

So, the K expression becomes:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])
=> 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x)
=> 5e10 = 0.02 / x²
Hmm, solving for x.

So rearrange: x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 = 4e-14 / 1e1 (wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)*1e-12.

So 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12, which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7?

Wait, wait, let me calculate sqrt(4e-13). 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7 M. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me make sure I did that math right. Let's compute:

x² = (0.02) / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = (sqrt(4)) * (sqrt(1e-13)) = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me look at the options.

Options are:
A) 2.0x10^-2 M
B)5.0x10^-3
C)6.3x10^-7
D)1.0x10^-2

So option C matches the calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I set up the equation correctly?

Because EDTA is a polydentate ligand, and the formation constant given is for the complex. Yes, but the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So because K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca²+] is very low.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation equation.

Another approach: the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M. The dissociation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

But, since [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x (because each dissociation gives one of each), then:

5e10 = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Which is the same calculation as before.

So yes, x is about 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer would be option C.
