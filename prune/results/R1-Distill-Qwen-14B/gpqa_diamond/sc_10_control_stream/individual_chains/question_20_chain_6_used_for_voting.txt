Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is an assumption where nucleons behave like free particles, right? So the question is asking which of the four assumptions together imply this.

Let me read the question again. It says the assumption is that nucleons act like free nucleons, which is the impulse approximation. So I need to pick the three statements that together lead to this.

The four options are numbered 1,2,3,4. The options given are combinations of these. Let me go through each point.

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So this means the force acts on each nucleon separately, not on the nucleus as a whole. That makes sense because if the current only interacts with each, they can be treated as if they're free.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent? Oh, I think this means that only one nucleon is involved in the interaction, and the rest are like a backdrop—so the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction beyond that one nucleon. Like, other nucleons don't influence the process, so the selected one behaves freely.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, non-relativistic quarks. Well, in the impulse approximation, maybe they assume that the internal motion of the nucleon (like the quarks) is not affected by the interaction. Or that the quarks are moving slowly enough that relativistic effects are negligible. Not sure how this ties into the approximation directly, but it's about the internal state of the nucleon.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right. That sounds like saying the nucleon isn't held tightly by the nucleus during the interaction. So it's treated as free because it's not bound, so its motion isn't restricted—like a free particle.

So the impulse approximation would require that the interaction is with individual nucleons, those nucleons aren't bound, and the nucleus doesn't otherwise interfere except for the one nucleon. Let me think about each statement.

Statement 1: If the current only interacts with individual nucleons, that's like considering each as independent. So yes, that's part of the approximation.

Statement 2: The nucleus being transparent apart from the selected nucleon. So the other nucleons don't contribute; only the one nucleon is involved. So the others don't affect the interaction. That would mean that the selected nucleon can be treated as if it's free because the rest don't influence the process.

Statement 3: Quarks are non-relativistic. I'm not entirely clear on how this fits. The impulse approximation might assume that the nucleon's internal structure doesn't change much during the interaction. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their kinetic energies are low, so external forces (like the interaction) don't significantly affect them. But I'm not sure if this is a necessary condition for the impulse approximation. It's an internal property, whereas the other statements are about the interaction with the rest of the nucleus.

Statement 4: The nucleon experiences no binding forces. So it's moving freely. If it's bound, its motion would be affected by the surrounding nucleons, which isn't the case here.

So the approximation requires that the interaction is with individual nucleons (1), the nucleus doesn't interfere beyond that (2), and the nucleon isn't bound (4). Statement 3 might not directly contribute to the approximation. It's more about the internal state of the nucleon.

Wait, but some sources say that in the impulse approximation, the collective motion of nucleons is ignored, and each is treated as if it's free. So the key points are: individual interactions, no effect from other nucleons (nucleus is transparent), and the nucleon isn't bound.

So the three statements are 1, 2, and 4. Which option is that? Let's look at the options.

Option A: 1,2,4. Yes.

Option B: 2,3,4. No, because 3 is about quarks.

Option C:1,2,3. No, because 3 doesn't directly imply the approximation.

Option D:1,3,4. No, because D includes 3.

So the correct answer should be A.

The impulse approximation in nuclear calculations assumes that nucleons behave as free particles. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze the given options:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption implies that the interaction acts on each nucleon separately, treating them as independent entities. This is consistent with the impulse approximation.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that only one nucleon is involved in the interaction, and the rest of the nucleus does not influence the process. This assumption supports the idea that the selected nucleon can be treated as free.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: While this assumption pertains to the internal state of the nucleon, it does not directly contribute to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the interaction with the nucleus and the treatment of nucleons as free particles.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This assumption directly implies that the nucleon is treated as free, as it is not bound by the nuclear forces during the interaction.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. These assumptions ensure that the interaction is treated as if it occurs with individual, free nucleons, ignoring the effects of the nucleus and binding forces. The assumption about non-relativistic quarks (statement 3) is not directly relevant to the impulse approximation.

**Correct Answer: A**
