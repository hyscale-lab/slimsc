Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated in different directions and its dependence on wavelength and angle.

Alright, the problem states that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f in terms of λ.

Wait, I think this has something to do with the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something similar. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle (which is the radiation intensity) depends on the angle θ.

The formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (1/(λ²)) multiplied by sin²θ. Wait, no, more accurately, I think the radiation intensity U is proportional to (d²P/dω²)² divided by something. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to recall the standard formula.

The radiation intensity for an oscillating dipole is given by U = ( (μ₀ * p₀² ω⁴ ) / (12π c³) ) * (1/(4π)) ) * sin²θ. Wait, I might be mixing up the constants, but the key point is the dependence on sin²θ and the wavelength.

Wait, another approach: the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The average power is P_avg = ( (μ₀ μ_A² ω⁴ ) / (6π c³) ), where μ_A is the dipole moment's amplitude. But that's the total power. The power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be this P_avg divided by the solid angle where the power is directed. For a dipole, the radiation is directed predominantly in the equatorial plane (θ=90 degrees), but the exact pattern depends on θ.

Wait, the radiation intensity U is given by U = ( ( μ₀ |p|² ω^4 ) / (12π c³) ) * (1/(4π)) ) * ( sin²θ ). Or maybe I should think in terms of the angular dependence.

Wait, I think the angular distribution for a dipole is sin²θ. So the intensity is maximum when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. But the question here is about θ=30 degrees. So I need to find what fraction of the maximum power is radiated at that angle.

Wait, the maximum intensity occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is sinθ =1, so θ=90 degrees. So the intensity at θ=30 degrees would be (sin30)^2 times the maximum. Because the maximum is at sinθ=1, which is (sin30)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the intensity at θ=30 degrees is 1/4 of the maximum intensity. Wait, but wait, the maximum power is A. Is the intensity A, or is A the total power?

Wait, the problem says the maximum power radiated is A. So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle? Or is A the total power? Hmm, I think that's a crucial point.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says the maximum power thus radiated is A. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The question states that the power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ), and the maximum is A. So A is the maximum value of f(λ,θ) multiplied by the solid angle? Or A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle? Or perhaps the maximum value of the total power.

Wait, let's clarify. The power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). The maximum power would be when f is maximum. So A is the maximum value of f. So if f_max = A, then the intensity at θ=30 degrees is (sin^2 30) * A? Because the angular dependence is sin^2θ.

Yes, that makes sense. So the intensity at any angle θ is A multiplied by sin^2θ. Because the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ=1, so f_max = A.

So at θ=30 degrees, sinθ=0.5, so sin^2θ=0.25. So the fraction of A is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4. So looking at the options, let's see which options have 1/4 as the first part.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1/2, λ^-4

Option B: 1/4, λ^-3

Option C: 1/4, λ^-4

Option D: 3/4, λ^-6

So the fraction is 1/4, so options B and C have that.

The second part is about the form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. From earlier, I think that for dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to 1/(λ^4) multiplied by sin²θ. Because λ is inversely proportional to ω, and the intensity depends on ω^4. Let me think: the Larmor formula for power is P = ( ( μ₀ μ_0² ω^4 ) / (6π c³) ), so the power per unit solid angle would be P/(4π) times sin²θ. Wait, because the total power is spread over 4π steradians, but the intensity in each direction varies as sin²θ.

Wait, the exact form: the radiation intensity U is proportional to (ω^4)/(c^3) multiplied by sin^2θ and something else. Since ω = 2π c / λ, substituting that in, ω^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 / λ^4. So U is proportional to ( (c^4 / λ^4) ) * sin²θ / c^3 ) = (c / λ^4) sin²θ. Wait, but wait, where did I get that from? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the dependence on λ.

Alternatively, knowing that the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ. So the function f(λ,θ) is proportional to 1/λ^4 times sin²θ. So the form of f is λ^-4 multiplied by sin^2θ.

Looking at the options, the second part of the option is the dependence on λ.

So the function f is proportional to λ^-4. So the second part of the correct option should be lambda^-4.

Looking back, options B and C have the fraction as 1/4. Now check their second parts.

Option B: λ^-3 → no, we have λ^-4.

Option C: λ^-4 → yes.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me just make sure about the fraction. Is the fraction of the maximum intensity equal to sin^2(theta) or something else?

Because the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees, which is 1. So the intensity at θ is I = I_max * sin^2(theta). So at 30 degrees, I is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 of I_max, which is A. So the fraction is 1/4, so the first part is 1/4.

Yes, so option C has both parts correct.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which radiates power per unit solid angle as a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional form of \( f \) in terms of \( \lambda \).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and inversely proportional to \( \lambda^4 \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so the intensity is reduced by a factor of \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The functional form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \), as derived from the dependence of the radiation intensity on the wavelength \( \lambda \). Therefore, the correct option must have \( 1/4 \) as the fraction of the maximum power and \( \lambda^{-4} \) as the dependence on \( \lambda \).

Among the given options:
- **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the functional form.
- **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Wait, the exact form: the radiation intensity U is proportional to (ω^4)/(c^3) multiplied by sin^2θ and something else. Since ω = 2π c / λ, substituting that in, ω^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 / λ^4. So U is proportional to ( (c^4 / λ^4) ) * sin²θ / c^3 ) = (c / λ^4) sin²θ. Wait, but wait, where did I get that from? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the dependence on λ.

Alternatively, knowing that the intensity is proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ. So the function f(λ,θ) is proportional to 1/λ^4 times sin²θ. So the form of f is λ^-4 multiplied by sin^2θ.

Looking at the options, the second part of the option is the dependence on λ.

So the function f is proportional to λ^-4. So the second part of the correct option should be lambda^-4.

Looking back, options B and C have the fraction as 1/4. Now check their second parts.

Option B: λ^-3 → no, we have λ^-4.

Option C: λ^-4 → yes.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me just make sure about the fraction. Is the fraction of the maximum intensity equal to sin^2(theta) or something else?

Because the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees, which is 1. So the intensity at θ is I = I_max * sin^2(theta). So at 30 degrees, I is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 of I_max, which is A. So the fraction is 1/4, so the first part is 1/4.

Yes, so option C has both parts correct.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which radiates power per unit solid angle as a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional form of \( f \) in terms of \( \lambda \).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \) and inversely proportional to \( \lambda^4 \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so the intensity is reduced by a factor of \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The functional form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \), as derived from the dependence of the radiation intensity on the wavelength \( \lambda \). Therefore, the correct option must have \( 1/4 \) as the fraction of the maximum power and \( \lambda^{-4} \) as the dependence on \( \lambda \).

Among the given options:
- **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the functional form.
- **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the functional dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
