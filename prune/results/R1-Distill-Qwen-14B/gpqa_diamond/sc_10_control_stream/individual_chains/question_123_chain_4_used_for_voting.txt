Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and something about the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but inertial frames are non-accelerating, right, so that's fine.

The problem is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh wait, I need to find the distance from the ejecta's perspective from the Galaxy's point of view, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame.

I remember that time dilation and length contraction are involved in such problems. So, the key here is probably special relativity because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me think about the speed: 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to something I'm more familiar with. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light, or 20% the speed. Not super high, but not negligible either. So relativistic effects are present.

Wait, but in which frame? Let's clarify the frames. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at the same speed. Oh, right, because velocity is relative. So, the two frames are moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to each other.

So, the question is: in the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover in 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. Wait, but wait, time is different in each frame. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this using the Lorentz transformation. Let's think about the events. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves towards them, and in their own frame, they're stationary. So, when 50 seconds pass in their frame, how much distance have they moved in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, no. The question is about how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I think I need to find the proper time or perhaps use the time dilation formula.

Wait, okay, let me clarify the scenario.

In the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta (S') is moving towards them at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards them at velocity v. So, in S', the Galaxy's velocity is v.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame).

Wait, but wait. The time in S' is 50 seconds. So, the question is, how much time passes in S during that 50 seconds? Because the distance in S (Galaxy's frame) would be v multiplied by the time in S.

So, first I need to find out how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame). Then, multiply that time by the velocity v to get the distance.

So, time dilation. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, which frame is which. Because in the S' frame, the time is t', and the event is moving. So, the time in S would be the proper time or not?

Wait, no. If two events happen at the same place in S, then the time in S is the proper time. But in this case, in S', the events are at the same place (e.g., the front and back of the object, but I'm not sure). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between time in S and time in S' when the events are at the same place in S'. Hmm.

Wait, in this problem, the 50 seconds in S' correspond to the time between two events: the start and the end of the 50-second interval in S'. So, in S', these two events happen at the same location (since the ejecta is moving, but in its own frame, it's stationary, and the galaxy is moving). So, the proper time is t', and the other frame would see a longer time.

Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time between two events, measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. So, if the two events (e.g., the start and end of the 50-second period) occur at the same point in S', then t' is the proper time, and in S, the time would be longer.

So, the time in S, t, is t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, but wait. Let me think: if t' is the proper time, then t = gamma * t' only if the events are at the same location in S'. Since in S', the two events (start and end of the time) are at the same place, then yes, t' is the proper time.

So, yes, the time in S would be t = gamma * t'.

Once I have t, the distance the ejecta moves in S is v * t.

So, let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate gamma.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is 3e5 km/s.

So, v = 0.2 c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

What's sqrt(0.96)? Let me approximate. 0.96 is 24/25, so sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.899/5 ≈ 0.9798.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.

So, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

Then, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is about 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s, t is approximately 51.03 s.

So, distance = 60000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60000 * 51.03 = ?

Let me compute that.

60000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60000 * 1.03 = 60000 * 1 = 60000, plus 60000 * 0.03 = 1800 → 61,800.

So, 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but wait, that's 3,061,800 km. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close. But let me check my calculations again because approximation can cause differences.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute 0.96 under the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.

We know that 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.

Wait, but 24/25 is 0.96, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.

So, 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.02062.

So, t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

So, 50 * 1.02062 = approximately 51.031 s.

Then, v * t = 60000 km/s * 51.031 s = 60000 * 51.031 = ?

Compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 * 0.031 = 1,860.

So, total is 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close, but not exact. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I should be using length contraction instead. Because maybe the distance in the ejecta frame is moving, so the distance we're considering is the proper length or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames. Let me think again.

In the Galaxy frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v. In the S frame, the ejecta is moving. So, from S, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time elapsed in S.

But the problem is that the time we have is in the S' (ejecta) frame. So, we need to relate the time in S' to the time in S.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to consider the distance as measured in each frame. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance they need to cover (the distance between them and the Galaxy) is contracted.

Wait, maybe that's the right way. Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. So, the proper length (distance) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is L0 (unknown), but in the ejecta's frame, that length is length-contracted.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the proper length, but perhaps it's not needed. Hmm, perhaps that's not the way to go.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think about the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame, which is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, t.

But t is the time in the Galaxy's frame during which the ejecta's frame experiences 50 seconds. So, t in S = gamma * t' = (1.0206) *50 ≈ 51.03 s.

So, distance in S is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km, which is 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. But perhaps I should check if I made any miscalculations in gamma or the time.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute (1 - v²/c²) first.

v = 6e4 km/s = 0.2c.

v² = (0.2)^2 c² = 0.04 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206207.

So, t = 50 * 1.0206207 ≈ 51.031 s.

So, distance is 6e4 * 51.031 = 6e4 * 51.031.

6e4 is 60,000 km/s.

So, 60,000 * 51.031 = 

51.031 * 60,000 = ?

51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.031 *60,000 = 1,860.

Total: 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have 3,061,860. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but using the time in the ejecta's frame, but without considering that the time is dilated. So, perhaps the mistake is that I should just multiply v by t', without considering time dilation. But that would be incorrect because the time experienced in different frames is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction is the other way around. Because the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in S, while in S' the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity. The velocity of the ejecta in S is v. So, in S, the ejecta's velocity is v, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in S.

But what is the time in S? Because 50 seconds in S' correspond to more time in S.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing which frame is which. Let me try another approach.

In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta moves at speed v towards the Galaxy. So, in S, the position of the ejecta as a function of time is x = x0 + v * t. Since it's moving towards the center, perhaps x0 is the initial position, but the exact position isn't given, so maybe that's not needed.

But the key is to find the time in S for which the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. That's the time dilation aspect.

So, as before, t = gamma * t'. So, gamma is about 1.0206, t' is 50 s, so t ≈51.03 s.

So, the distance is v * t ≈6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the velocity in the opposite direction, or perhaps I should compute the length contraction instead.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the distance between themselves and the Galaxy is length-contracted. So, if in the Galaxy's frame the distance is L, then in the ejecta's frame it's L' = L / gamma.

But wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, given the time passed in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.

Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. So, the time it takes for the Galaxy to reach the ejecta (if they were at rest) would be t' = L' / v, where L' is the contracted length.

But I don't know L', the proper length. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time. So, 60,000 * 51.03 is 3,061,800. But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000. That's very close. Maybe the approximation of gamma is being considered as exactly 1.02.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

0.96 is 96/100. Let me compute sqrt(96) = approx 9.798... So sqrt(96) is about 9.798, so sqrt(96/100)=0.9798.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, 50 *1.0206 = 51.03.

So, 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the time experienced is t', and the distance they move in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma(t' + (v x')/c²), where x' is the position. Wait, but maybe that's for when the events are not at the same place in S'.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformation for time.

Wait, the Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²).

But in this case, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events are: event 1 is the start of the time interval at (x'=0, t'=0), and event 2 is at (x'=0, t'=50 s). So, in S', x' is the same for both events.

So, for event 1: t' =0, x'=0 → in S, t = gamma (0 + (v *0)/c² ) → t=0.

For event 2: t'=50 s, x'=0 → t = gamma*(50 + (v*0)/c² ) = gamma*50.

So, the time in S is gamma *50 s, which is what I calculated earlier.

So, yes, the time in S is gamma *50, and the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t = v * gamma *50.

So, that gives me 6e4 *1.0206 *50 = 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 2,940,000 km.
B)3,000,000 km.
C)2,880,000 km.
D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm, none is exactly 3,061,800, but D is 3,060,000, which is the closest.

Wait, perhaps the question expects an approximate calculation, ignoring the exact gamma and just using v multiplied by t', but that would be wrong because time in S is longer than t'.

Wait, maybe they're considering the velocity as 60,000 km/s, and time as 50 s, so 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. That would be option B. But that neglects relativistic effects, which are present here.

But the problem says both are inertial frames, so we can't ignore relativity. So, the correct calculation must include gamma.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what's being asked.

Wait, re-reading the question: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So, the approach is correct. So, the distance is 3,061,800 km, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

So, perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma with higher precision.

v = 0.2c.

v² = 0.04 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620725.

So, 50 * gamma ≈51.031036275.

So, 6e4 *51.031036275 = 6e4 *51.031036275 = 60000 *51.031036275 = ?

Compute 60000 *51 = 3,060,000, 60000 *0.031036275 = 1,862.1765.

So, total is 3,060,000 + 1,862.1765 = 3,061,862.1765 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the approximation gamma ≈1.02, leading to 51 s, and 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects, which would give 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option B), but that seems incorrect given that the problem states to consider inertial frames, which implies using relativity.

But perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what the question says. The question specifies the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance using the proper time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is using the velocity as observed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. Option D is 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51. So, exactly 60,000 multiplied by 51.

Since 51 is 50*1.02, which is gamma as 1.02.

So, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02 = 51, and 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.

So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   The time dilation formula relates the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)):  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.2c \),  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
   \]  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \),  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \),  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\( \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D \), which is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This slight discrepancy likely arises from rounding approximations in \( \gamma \). Thus, the best match is option \( D \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). 

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and something about the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but inertial frames are non-accelerating, right, so that's fine.

The problem is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? Oh wait, I need to find the distance from the ejecta's perspective from the Galaxy's point of view, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame.

I remember that time dilation and length contraction are involved in such problems. So, the key here is probably special relativity because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me think about the speed: 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to something I'm more familiar with. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light, or 20% the speed. Not super high, but not negligible either. So relativistic effects are present.

Wait, but in which frame? Let's clarify the frames. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at the same speed. Oh, right, because velocity is relative. So, the two frames are moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to each other.

So, the question is: in the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover in 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. Wait, but wait, time is different in each frame. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this using the Lorentz transformation. Let's think about the events. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy moves towards them, and in their own frame, they're stationary. So, when 50 seconds pass in their frame, how much distance have they moved in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, no. The question is about how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I think I need to find the proper time or perhaps use the time dilation formula.

Wait, okay, let me clarify the scenario.

In the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta (S') is moving towards them at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So, in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards them at velocity v. So, in S', the Galaxy's velocity is v.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame).

Wait, but wait. The time in S' is 50 seconds. So, the question is, how much time passes in S during that 50 seconds? Because the distance in S (Galaxy's frame) would be v multiplied by the time in S.

So, first I need to find out how much time passes in S (Galaxy's frame) when 50 seconds pass in S' (ejecta's frame). Then, multiply that time by the velocity v to get the distance.

So, time dilation. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, which frame is which. Because in the S' frame, the time is t', and the event is moving. So, the time in S would be the proper time or not?

Wait, no. If two events happen at the same place in S, then the time in S is the proper time. But in this case, in S', the events are at the same place (e.g., the front and back of the object, but I'm not sure). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relationship between time in S and time in S' when the events are at the same place in S'. Hmm.

Wait, in this problem, the 50 seconds in S' correspond to the time between two events: the start and the end of the 50-second interval in S'. So, in S', these two events happen at the same location (since the ejecta is moving, but in its own frame, it's stationary, and the galaxy is moving). So, the proper time is t', and the other frame would see a longer time.

Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time between two events, measured in the frame where the events happen at the same place. So, if the two events (e.g., the start and end of the 50-second period) occur at the same point in S', then t' is the proper time, and in S, the time would be longer.

So, the time in S, t, is t = gamma * t' ?

Wait, but wait. Let me think: if t' is the proper time, then t = gamma * t' only if the events are at the same location in S'. Since in S', the two events (start and end of the time) are at the same place, then yes, t' is the proper time.

So, yes, the time in S would be t = gamma * t'.

Once I have t, the distance the ejecta moves in S is v * t.

So, let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate gamma.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. The speed of light c is 3e5 km/s.

So, v = 0.2 c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

What's sqrt(0.96)? Let me approximate. 0.96 is 24/25, so sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.899/5 ≈ 0.9798.

So, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, as I had before.

So, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

Then, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is about 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is v * t.

v is 60,000 km/s, t is approximately 51.03 s.

So, distance = 60000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60000 * 51.03 = ?

Let me compute that.

60000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60000 * 1.03 = 60000 * 1 = 60000, plus 60000 * 0.03 = 1800 → 61,800.

So, 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but wait, that's 3,061,800 km. Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close. But let me check my calculations again because approximation can cause differences.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute 0.96 under the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely.

We know that 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.

Wait, but 24/25 is 0.96, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898.

So, 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.02062.

So, t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

So, 50 * 1.02062 = approximately 51.031 s.

Then, v * t = 60000 km/s * 51.031 s = 60000 * 51.031 = ?

Compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 * 0.031 = 1,860.

So, total is 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close, but not exact. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I should be using length contraction instead. Because maybe the distance in the ejecta frame is moving, so the distance we're considering is the proper length or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the frames. Let me think again.

In the Galaxy frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v. In the S frame, the ejecta is moving. So, from S, the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by the time elapsed in S.

But the problem is that the time we have is in the S' (ejecta) frame. So, we need to relate the time in S' to the time in S.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to consider the distance as measured in each frame. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them, so the distance they need to cover (the distance between them and the Galaxy) is contracted.

Wait, maybe that's the right way. Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. So, the proper length (distance) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is L0 (unknown), but in the ejecta's frame, that length is length-contracted.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the proper length, but perhaps it's not needed. Hmm, perhaps that's not the way to go.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think about the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame, which is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, t.

But t is the time in the Galaxy's frame during which the ejecta's frame experiences 50 seconds. So, t in S = gamma * t' = (1.0206) *50 ≈ 51.03 s.

So, distance in S is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km, which is 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. But perhaps I should check if I made any miscalculations in gamma or the time.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute (1 - v²/c²) first.

v = 6e4 km/s = 0.2c.

v² = (0.2)^2 c² = 0.04 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206207.

So, t = 50 * 1.0206207 ≈ 51.031 s.

So, distance is 6e4 * 51.031 = 6e4 * 51.031.

6e4 is 60,000 km/s.

So, 60,000 * 51.031 = 

51.031 * 60,000 = ?

51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.031 *60,000 = 1,860.

Total: 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have 3,061,860. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km. So, perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame, but using the time in the ejecta's frame, but without considering that the time is dilated. So, perhaps the mistake is that I should just multiply v by t', without considering time dilation. But that would be incorrect because the time experienced in different frames is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction is the other way around. Because the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in S, while in S' the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity. The velocity of the ejecta in S is v. So, in S, the ejecta's velocity is v, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in S.

But what is the time in S? Because 50 seconds in S' correspond to more time in S.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing which frame is which. Let me try another approach.

In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta moves at speed v towards the Galaxy. So, in S, the position of the ejecta as a function of time is x = x0 + v * t. Since it's moving towards the center, perhaps x0 is the initial position, but the exact position isn't given, so maybe that's not needed.

But the key is to find the time in S for which the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. That's the time dilation aspect.

So, as before, t = gamma * t'. So, gamma is about 1.0206, t' is 50 s, so t ≈51.03 s.

So, the distance is v * t ≈6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the velocity in the opposite direction, or perhaps I should compute the length contraction instead.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the distance between themselves and the Galaxy is length-contracted. So, if in the Galaxy's frame the distance is L, then in the ejecta's frame it's L' = L / gamma.

But wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, given the time passed in the ejecta's frame. Hmm.

Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v. So, the time it takes for the Galaxy to reach the ejecta (if they were at rest) would be t' = L' / v, where L' is the contracted length.

But I don't know L', the proper length. So perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply that the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time. So, 60,000 * 51.03 is 3,061,800. But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000. That's very close. Maybe the approximation of gamma is being considered as exactly 1.02.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

0.96 is 96/100. Let me compute sqrt(96) = approx 9.798... So sqrt(96) is about 9.798, so sqrt(96/100)=0.9798.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, 50 *1.0206 = 51.03.

So, 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the time experienced is t', and the distance they move in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma(t' + (v x')/c²), where x' is the position. Wait, but maybe that's for when the events are not at the same place in S'.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Lorentz transformation for time.

Wait, the Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²).

But in this case, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events are: event 1 is the start of the time interval at (x'=0, t'=0), and event 2 is at (x'=0, t'=50 s). So, in S', x' is the same for both events.

So, for event 1: t' =0, x'=0 → in S, t = gamma (0 + (v *0)/c² ) → t=0.

For event 2: t'=50 s, x'=0 → t = gamma*(50 + (v*0)/c² ) = gamma*50.

So, the time in S is gamma *50 s, which is what I calculated earlier.

So, yes, the time in S is gamma *50, and the distance the ejecta travels in S is v * t = v * gamma *50.

So, that gives me 6e4 *1.0206 *50 = 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) 2,940,000 km.
B)3,000,000 km.
C)2,880,000 km.
D)3,060,000 km.

Hmm, none is exactly 3,061,800, but D is 3,060,000, which is the closest.

Wait, perhaps the question expects an approximate calculation, ignoring the exact gamma and just using v multiplied by t', but that would be wrong because time in S is longer than t'.

Wait, maybe they're considering the velocity as 60,000 km/s, and time as 50 s, so 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. That would be option B. But that neglects relativistic effects, which are present here.

But the problem says both are inertial frames, so we can't ignore relativity. So, the correct calculation must include gamma.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what's being asked.

Wait, re-reading the question: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, in the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So, the approach is correct. So, the distance is 3,061,800 km, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

So, perhaps the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma with higher precision.

v = 0.2c.

v² = 0.04 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620725.

So, 50 * gamma ≈51.031036275.

So, 6e4 *51.031036275 = 6e4 *51.031036275 = 60000 *51.031036275 = ?

Compute 60000 *51 = 3,060,000, 60000 *0.031036275 = 1,862.1765.

So, total is 3,060,000 + 1,862.1765 = 3,061,862.1765 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the approximation gamma ≈1.02, leading to 51 s, and 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects, which would give 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option B), but that seems incorrect given that the problem states to consider inertial frames, which implies using relativity.

But perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what the question says. The question specifies the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance using the proper time, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is using the velocity as observed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. Option D is 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51. So, exactly 60,000 multiplied by 51.

Since 51 is 50*1.02, which is gamma as 1.02.

So, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02 = 51, and 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.

So, the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   The time dilation formula relates the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)):  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.2c \),  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206.
   \]  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \),  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \),  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\( \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D \), which is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This slight discrepancy likely arises from rounding approximations in \( \gamma \). Thus, the best match is option \( D \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). 

**Answer: D**
