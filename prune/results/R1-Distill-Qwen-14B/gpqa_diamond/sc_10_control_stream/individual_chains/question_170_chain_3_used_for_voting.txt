Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, does that mean it's a two-component vector? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T or something like that. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors because electrons have spin-1/2.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again. So the formula is something like <S_y> = χ† σ_y χ.

Wait, what's σ_y? Oh yeah, the Pauli matrix for y. The problem gives it as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So I need to construct the matrices and perform the calculations step by step.

First, the state vector χ is [3i; 4], right? Let me write that correctly. The components are χ₁ = 3i and χ₂ = 4.

The expectation value formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/2) * ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩. Oh wait, because the spin operator S is (ℏ/2) σ, so S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y. So when calculating the expectation value, we'll have (ℏ/2) times the expectation of σ_y.

Wait, is that correct? So the spin operator S is given by S = (ℏ/2) σ. So in this problem, S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ℏ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩.

So first, I should compute ⟨σ_y⟩, which is χ† σ_y χ. Then multiply by ℏ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

Let me compute χ† σ_y χ. 

χ† is the conjugate transpose, so for χ = [3i, 4]^T, χ† would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, but wait, wait. Let me think again. If χ is a column vector [a; b], then χ† is [a*, b*], which is a row vector. So χ† here is [ -3, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i. Oh wait, no: (3i)* is -3i? No, wait, no. Wait, (a + ib)* is a - ib. So (3i) is 0 + i*3. Its conjugate is 0 - i*3, which is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original vector is [3i;4]. So χ† is [3i*, 4*]. So 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4 (since it's real). So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i. So yes, χ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, multiply χ† by σ_y. Let me write that out. 

σ_y is the matrix:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So χ† is a row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

So first, the multiplication χ† σ_y: 

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 = (3i²) +0. Wait, because (-3i)*(-i) is 3i². Because (-3i) multiplied by (-i) is (3i²). Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, let me compute each element of the resulting vector:

Wait, wait, no. The multiplication is χ† multiplied by σ_y. So it's a 1x2 vector multiplied by 2x2 matrix, resulting in a 1x2 vector.

So the first component is ( -3i )*(0) + 4*(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

The second component is ( -3i )*(-i) + 4*(0) = (3i²) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the result of χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Then, multiply this result by χ, which is the column vector [3i; 4].

So [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4] is 4i*3i + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

(-3)*4 = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: I think I might have messed up the multiplication steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y is:
Row 1: [0, -i]
Row 2: [i, 0]

So χ† multiplied by σ_y is:

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i² +0. i² is -1, so this is 3*(-1) = -3.

So the resulting vector is [4i, -3].

Then multiply by χ, which is [3i;4], as a column vector.

Wait, no, in matrix multiplication, when you have a 1x2 vector multiplied by a 2x1 vector, it's an inner product.

So [4i, -3] · [3i;4] = 4i *3i + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i =12 i² =12*(-1)= -12.

(-3)*4= -12.

Total: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So χ† σ_y χ = -24.

But wait, in the problem statement, σ_y is given, and the expectation value is (ℏ/2) multiplied by this value. So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but wait! Because the Pauli matrix σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, so when you compute χ† σ_y χ, that's the expectation value of σ_y, which is a dimensionless quantity. Then S_y is (ℏ/2) σ_y, so the expectation is (ℏ/2) times that.

So in this case, we have ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are fractions involving hbar and 25. Hmm. None of the options match -12 hbar. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) -12 hbar /25

B) 12 hbar /25

C) 25 hbar /2

D) -25 hbar /2

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Because the expectation value I calculated is -12 hbar, but that's not an option. So perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is normalized? Because if the state isn't normalized, then the expectation value needs to take that into account. Because the formula is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ), but wait, no, that's for when the state isn't normalized. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized, but in this problem, is the given vector normalized?

Let me check the norm of χ. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. Therefore, when calculating the expectation value, I should divide by the norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is given by (ψ† A ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. But in this case, ψ is given as (3i,4), and the norm is sqrt(25) =5. So the actual state is (1/5)(3i,4).

Wait, but wait, in the way the question is phrased, the state is (3i,4). So perhaps I should normalize the state before calculating the expectation value.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ† S_y ψ)/(ψ† ψ), because the state might not be normalized. Because the given state's norm is 5, so we'd have to adjust.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have a state vector ψ, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, but if ψ isn't normalized, it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So in our case, χ is (3i,4). So the inner product χ† χ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16 =25. So the normalization factor is 25.

So the expectation value is [ (χ† σ_y χ) ] / (χ† χ) ) multiplied by (ℏ/2).

Wait, because S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y.

So let's recompute.

Earlier, I got χ† σ_y χ as -24. So with normalization, the expectation value of σ_y is (-24) / 25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ℏ) /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but why did I get -24 without considering normalization? Because I forgot that the state isn't normalized. Oh yes, that's a common mistake. So the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

So the correct expectation value is (-12 ℏ)/25, which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \chi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \), and \( \chi^\dagger \chi \) ensures normalization.

3. **Conjugate Transpose of \( \chi \)**: The state vector \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) has the conjugate transpose:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \)**:
   - Multiply \( \chi^\dagger \) and \( \sigma_y \):
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - Multiply the result by \( \chi \):
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
     Compute each term:
     \[
     4i \cdot 3i = 12i^2 = -12, \quad -3 \cdot 4 = -12.
     \]
     Summing these gives:
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = -12 - 12 = -24.
     \]

5. **Normalization**: The norm of \( \chi \) is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula for \( \langle S_y \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{-24}{25} \right) = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, does that mean it's a two-component vector? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T or something like that. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors because electrons have spin-1/2.

Wait, what's σ_y? Oh yeah, the Pauli matrix for y. The problem gives it as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So I need to construct the matrices and perform the calculations step by step.

First, the state vector χ is [3i; 4], right? Let me write that correctly. The components are χ₁ = 3i and χ₂ = 4.

The expectation value formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/2) * ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩. Oh wait, because the spin operator S is (ℏ/2) σ, so S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y. So when calculating the expectation value, we'll have (ℏ/2) times the expectation of σ_y.

Wait, is that correct? So the spin operator S is given by S = (ℏ/2) σ. So in this problem, S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ℏ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩.

So first, I should compute ⟨σ_y⟩, which is χ† σ_y χ. Then multiply by ℏ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

Let me compute χ† σ_y χ. 

χ† is the conjugate transpose, so for χ = [3i, 4]^T, χ† would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, but wait, wait. Let me think again. If χ is a column vector [a; b], then χ† is [a*, b*], which is a row vector. So χ† here is [ -3, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i. Oh wait, no: (3i)* is -3i? No, wait, no. Wait, (a + ib)* is a - ib. So (3i) is 0 + i*3. Its conjugate is 0 - i*3, which is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original vector is [3i;4]. So χ† is [3i*, 4*]. So 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4 (since it's real). So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is a complex number. Its conjugate is -3i. So yes, χ† is [-3i, 4].

Now, multiply χ† by σ_y. Let me write that out. 

σ_y is the matrix:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So χ† is a row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

So first, the multiplication χ† σ_y: 

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 = (3i²) +0. Wait, because (-3i)*(-i) is 3i². Because (-3i) multiplied by (-i) is (3i²). Since i² is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

Wait, let me compute each element of the resulting vector:

Wait, wait, no. The multiplication is χ† multiplied by σ_y. So it's a 1x2 vector multiplied by 2x2 matrix, resulting in a 1x2 vector.

So the first component is ( -3i )*(0) + 4*(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

The second component is ( -3i )*(-i) + 4*(0) = (3i²) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So the result of χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Then, multiply this result by χ, which is the column vector [3i; 4].

So [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4] is 4i*3i + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

(-3)*4 = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: I think I might have messed up the multiplication steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y is:
Row 1: [0, -i]
Row 2: [i, 0]

So χ† multiplied by σ_y is:

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = 3i² +0. i² is -1, so this is 3*(-1) = -3.

So the resulting vector is [4i, -3].

Then multiply by χ, which is [3i;4], as a column vector.

Wait, no, in matrix multiplication, when you have a 1x2 vector multiplied by a 2x1 vector, it's an inner product.

So [4i, -3] · [3i;4] = 4i *3i + (-3)*4.

Compute each term:

4i *3i =12 i² =12*(-1)= -12.

(-3)*4= -12.

Total: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So χ† σ_y χ = -24.

But wait, in the problem statement, σ_y is given, and the expectation value is (ℏ/2) multiplied by this value. So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but wait! Because the Pauli matrix σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, so when you compute χ† σ_y χ, that's the expectation value of σ_y, which is a dimensionless quantity. Then S_y is (ℏ/2) σ_y, so the expectation is (ℏ/2) times that.

So in this case, we have ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ℏ)/2 = -12 ℏ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are fractions involving hbar and 25. Hmm. None of the options match -12 hbar. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) -12 hbar /25

B) 12 hbar /25

C) 25 hbar /2

D) -25 hbar /2

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Because the expectation value I calculated is -12 hbar, but that's not an option. So perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is normalized? Because if the state isn't normalized, then the expectation value needs to take that into account. Because the formula is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ), but wait, no, that's for when the state isn't normalized. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized, but in this problem, is the given vector normalized?

Let me check the norm of χ. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. Therefore, when calculating the expectation value, I should divide by the norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value is given by (ψ† A ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. But in this case, ψ is given as (3i,4), and the norm is sqrt(25) =5. So the actual state is (1/5)(3i,4).

Wait, but wait, in the way the question is phrased, the state is (3i,4). So perhaps I should normalize the state before calculating the expectation value.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ† S_y ψ)/(ψ† ψ), because the state might not be normalized. Because the given state's norm is 5, so we'd have to adjust.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have a state vector ψ, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, but if ψ isn't normalized, it's ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So in our case, χ is (3i,4). So the inner product χ† χ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16 =25. So the normalization factor is 25.

So the expectation value is [ (χ† σ_y χ) ] / (χ† χ) ) multiplied by (ℏ/2).

Wait, because S_y = (ℏ/2) σ_y.

So let's recompute.

Earlier, I got χ† σ_y χ as -24. So with normalization, the expectation value of σ_y is (-24) / 25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ℏ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ℏ) /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but why did I get -24 without considering normalization? Because I forgot that the state isn't normalized. Oh yes, that's a common mistake. So the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

So the correct expectation value is (-12 ℏ)/25, which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \chi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \), and \( \chi^\dagger \chi \) ensures normalization.

3. **Conjugate Transpose of \( \chi \)**: The state vector \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) has the conjugate transpose:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \)**:
   - Multiply \( \chi^\dagger \) and \( \sigma_y \):
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   - Multiply the result by \( \chi \):
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
     Compute each term:
     \[
     4i \cdot 3i = 12i^2 = -12, \quad -3 \cdot 4 = -12.
     \]
     Summing these gives:
     \[
     \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = -12 - 12 = -24.
     \]

5. **Normalization**: The norm of \( \chi \) is:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula for \( \langle S_y \rangle \):
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{-24}{25} \right) = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

7. **Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Answer: A
