Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges move, they generate both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about potentials, not the fields directly. So I need to think about how potentials are expressed for a moving charge.

The setup is a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, because the field at tr is what affects the point r at time t, since t > tr. So there's a retarded time involved here.

I think the scalar potential V is due to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. For a static charge, V would just be q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated.

Wait, for the scalar potential from a moving charge, it's not just the static solution anymore. I remember that the scalar potential can be expressed in terms of the retarded time. The scalar potential equation is something like (q/(4πε0)) multiplied by a term involving the distance and the speed. Or maybe it's more about the position and velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static case. I think the general expression for the scalar potential V(r, t) when the charge is moving is given by:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε0) * [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r + ... ) ]

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I remember that the scalar potential includes a term that accounts for the motion. Maybe it's related to the displacement vector d. Let me think. The displacement vector d is from the retarded position (where the charge was at time tr) to the current position r. So d = r - r', where r' is the position at time tr. So the magnitude of d is |d|.

But when the charge is moving, the potentials involve terms that depend on the velocity v of the charge. So perhaps the denominator in the potential expressions has a term involving c (speed of light) and the velocity.

In the options, I see expressions like (d c - d · v), or (d c + d · v). Oh right, I think the denominator comes from the term [d - (v/c²) t_r], but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, the expression for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v/c²) t_r)] but that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, I think the denominator is (d c) minus dot product of d and v, but scaled appropriately.

Looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)), and option D has (d c + d · v). Hmm, which one is correct.

Wait, in the context of retarded potentials, the denominator is often (r - (v/c) t_r), but in terms of d and v, perhaps it would be something like d c - (d · v) because d is the vector from the retarded point to the current point r.

Wait, let me think about the exact form. The scalar potential for a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v * t_r)/c²)]

But wait, t_r is the retarded time, which is the time it took for the influence to reach the point r. Alternatively, if the charge is moving, the position at the retarded time is r' = s(tr), and the vector from r' to r is d = r - r'.

In terms of velocity, v is the velocity at time tr, so v = dr'/dt evaluated at tr.

Hmm, perhaps the denominator should involve the term d c - (d · v) because when you consider the motion, you have to account for the time it takes the influence to travel. So maybe the denominator is (d c - (d · v)).

In terms of potentials, the scalar potential V would have this denominator multiplied by something. Let me look at the options.

Option C: V is qc over (4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v). So which is correct?

Wait, let me think about the units. The denominator must have units of length. Let's see, d has units of meters, v has units of m/s, and c is m/s. So d c would be meters * m/s = m²/s. Hmm, but that's not meters. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the denominator is d multiplied by c, minus the dot product of d and v. Let's compute the units: d (meters) times c (m/s) → m^2/s. The dot product d·v is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator has same units, so the overall expression is dimensionless. That can't be right because the denominator should be length. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d) but without the factors of c and so on. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the expression for the potentials in the context of retarded potentials.

I think the potentials for a moving charge involve terms like (r - (v/c^2) t), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by the Liénard expressions.

Wait, recalling the expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge:

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) [ 1 / |r - (v t)/c² | ] or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait no, more accurately, the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ].

Wait, or is it [1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]?

Wait, let me think about the expression for the scalar potential. When the charge is moving, the potential due to the charge at a point r at time t is not just 1/r but involves a term that corrects for the motion.

I remember that the electric field of a moving charge can be expressed as the gradient of the scalar potential plus the time derivative of the vector potential. But the potentials themselves are more complex.

Alternatively, for a charge in motion, the scalar potential is similar to the static case but modified by the motion. I think the expression involves (1 + (v/c)^2) or something like that in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential due to a charge in motion is given by the same expression as in the static case, but with r replaced by a sort of " retarded " position. So, perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ]

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I think the denominator in the potential expressions can be written as (d c - (d · v)), but scaled with appropriate factors to get the correct dimensions.

Wait, let's think about the denominator in the options. For option C, it's (d c - d · v). The unit of d is meters, c is m/s, so d c is m*(m/s) = m²/s. Similarly, d · v is (m)*(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator would be (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s, which is the same as (d c - (d · v)).

But for a potential, the denominator should have units of length, not m²/s. So perhaps there's a missing factor. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the terms. Let me think again. In the denominator, perhaps it's (d c) minus (v · d) — but where c is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (v · d)) multiplied by some factor. Wait, another thought: The term (d c - v · d) would be (d (c) - (d · v)).

Hmm, but the units don't add up. Maybe I'm missing some factors of time or other constants. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)/c), which would make the units correct.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Suppose d is in meters (m), c is m/s, v is m/s.

d * c → m*(m/s) = m²/s.

d · v → m*(m/s) = m²/s.

So (d c - d · v) → (m²/s - m²/s) = m²/s. But the denominator should be in meters because the potential is q/(4πε0 * something in meters). So (d c - d·v) can't be the denominator, because that would give 1/(m²/s) which is s/m, but we need 1/m.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (d c) - (v · d). Oh wait, that's what option C has. So let's see, but the units wouldn't add up. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d) multiplied by some other term, like 1/c or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (d c - v · d) divided by c, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz transformation approach. The scalar potential transforms under Lorentz transformations. But I’m not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potentials in terms of the expressions when the charge is moving with velocity v. The potentials would then be functions that include terms of velocity.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is moving, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity. So for a charge at rest, A is zero, but when it's moving, A is non-zero.

Looking at the options, A and B have A proportional to v² or v. Option C and D have A proportional to v.

So for a moving charge, A can't be zero, so options C and D are possible for A.

Now, the scalar potential. For a static charge, V is q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, V would have a more complicated form, possibly including terms with velocity.

So, let's look again at the options. Option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), and A as (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c + d·v)), and A as (μ0 q v)/(4π (d c + d·v)).

Hmm, so both C and D have similar structures, but with a plus or minus in the denominator.

Wait, another thought: The displacement vector d is from the retarded position to the current position. So, when the charge is moving, the displacement is r - r', where r' is the position at time tr. So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

In the denominator, (d c - d · v) would involve the vector d multiplied by c, minus the dot product of d and v. So, perhaps this is related to the term (d c - v · d) which would be written as (d × (c)) · something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)).

Wait, maybe I can think of the term in the denominator as (d - (v/c^2) t_r) multiplied by c, leading to (d c - (v t_r)/c). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The potentials for a moving charge are given by the Lienard potentials. Let me try to recall their form.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) [ 1/(r - (v t_r)/c²) ] or something like that. Wait, but r is the vector from the charge to the observation point at the current time. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the potentials can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ], and A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c) [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ]

But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, looking for an expression involving (d c - d·v):

If d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, then d = r - r'(tr), where r'(tr) is the position of the charge at the retarded time.

So, r'(tr) = s(tr), and the vector from s(tr) to r is d.

So, if the charge is moving with velocity v at time tr, then the displacement in space due to the charge's motion over time (t - tr) is v (t - tr) + higher-order terms (assuming acceleration is not too large).

Wait, but the term (t - tr) is the time it takes for the influence to reach the observer from the point of emission. Hmm, perhaps the denominator in the potentials includes a term that accounts for the charge's motion during that time.

Alternatively, the denominator comes from the fact that the charge's position when it emitted the field was s(tr), but the field is observed at a later time, so the influence has to catch up with the moving charge.

Wait, I think the denominator would involve the term (d c - v · d) because when the charge is moving, the effective distance the field has to travel is not just d but adjusted by the component of the velocity in the direction of d.

Wait, if d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, then the time it takes for the field to reach the observer is approximately (d · v)/c², because the charge's velocity affects the position. Hmm, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d).

Wait, but let me think about the speed of light. The field emitted at time tr from the charge's position r' = s(tr) must travel the distance d to reach r. But if the charge is moving, then the field's position at time t would have to account for how much the charge has moved in the mean time.

Alternatively, the denominator would be d - (v (t - tr)), but with appropriate scaling.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (d c - v · d) divided by c. So if I have:

denominator = (d c - v · d)/c = d - (v · d)/c².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact form. Let's instead look at the options again.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), A = (μ0 qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v).

Which one is correct? Let me think about the sign.

From the point of view of the displacement d, if the charge is moving away from the observation point, then the actual distance the field has to cover is longer, so the denominator would be larger, making the potential smaller. So, if the charge is moving in the same direction as d (d·v positive), the denominator would be larger (because d c - d·v could be smaller if d·v is positive, but wait, if d·v is positive, then d c - d·v would be smaller, which would make the denominator smaller, increasing the potential. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observer, d·v would be negative, so the denominator would be d c - (negative term), making it larger. So the potential would be smaller, which makes sense because the charge is approaching, so the effective distance is less.

Alternatively, I might be getting the signs mixed up. Maybe the denominator should be (d c + d·v), which would be the case in option D. If the charge is moving towards the observer, d·v would be negative, making the denominator smaller, leading to a larger potential. That might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)), which would adjust for the component of the velocity in the direction of d. So, if the charge is moving away, v and d are in the same direction, so v · d is positive, making the denominator larger, so V would be smaller. That makes sense because the charge is moving away, so the field would have to travel a longer distance.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observer, v · d is negative (because d points from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, so if the charge is moving towards the observer, v is in the direction opposite to d). So v · d would be negative, making the denominator smaller, so V would be larger. Which makes sense: the charge is closer now, so the potential is higher.

So, according to this reasoning, the denominator should be (d c - d·v), which is option C's denominator.

So, V would be (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)).

Then, the vector potential A would be (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), which is option C's A.

But wait, why is the scalar potential multiplied by c? Because the denominator has units of length, right? Let me check the units.

Let me compute the units for option C's V:

(qc) has units of (C)*(m/s). 4πε0 has units of (C²/(N·m²)). So (qc)/[4πε0 (d c - d·v)] → (C*(m/s)) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the denominator's units:

(d c - d·v) → (m*(m/s) ) - (m*(m/s)) → (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s. So denominator is [ (m²/s) ].

So numerator: (C * m/s).

Denominator: [ (C²/(N·m²)) ) * (m²/s) ) ] → (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) = C²/(N·s).

So, V has units: (C * m/s) / (C²/(N·s)) ) → (N·s * m/s) / C → (N·m) / C.

But since 1 N·m = 1 J and 1 J/C = 1 V. So the units are volts, which matches. So the units for option C's V are correct.

For the A option:

μ0 has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²).

So, (μ0 q c v) → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg·m³/(s^4·A²).

The denominator is same as before, [4π (d c - d·v)] → same as m²/s.

So, A's units: (kg·m³/(s^4·A²)) / (m²/s) ) → kg·m/(s^3·A²).

But the unit of A is Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla and A is related to B via B = ∇×A). Alternatively, the unit of A is Weber per square meter times meter → Weber per meter. Weber is V·s, so Weber per meter is (V·s)/m.

Wait, let me compute it another way. The unit of A is (kg·m/(s²·A))).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard expression for the vector potential.

The vector potential A has units of T·m² (tesla times square meters). But let's see the units based on the expression:

(μ0 q v ) / [ (d c - d·v) ]

μ0: H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²)

q: C = A·s

v: m/s

So, numerator:

μ0 * q * v → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (A s) * (m/s) ) → kg·m²/(s²·A) * (1/s) ) → kg·m²/(s^3·A).

Denominator: (d c - d·v) → m²/s.

So overall, A's units: (kg·m²/(s^3·A)) ) / (m²/s) ) → (kg·m²/(s^3·A)) ) * (s/m²) ) → kg/(s^2·A).

Wait, what's the unit for vector potential A? Let me recall: The unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m), because B is measured in Tesla, and A is integrated around a loop to give magnetic flux (B·A, which is in Weber, which is T·m²). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Maxwell equations. The unit analysis might be getting too complicated, so I'll try to proceed with the assumption that option C is correct.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are related to the fields. The electric field E is related to the scalar potential by E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The magnetic field B is ∇×A.

But since the charge is moving, we have to account for the vector potential and its time derivative. However, perhaps this isn't the easiest way to approach the problem.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are as follows: The scalar potential is (q/(4πε0)) * [ (1/(d c - d·v)) ] multiplied by c. So V = q c / [4πε0 (d c - d·v)].

Which would be option C's V.

Then, the vector potential A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), which matches option C.

So, I think option C is the correct one.

To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the retarded position by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials must account for the motion of the charge and the finite speed of light \( c \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \). However, for a moving charge, the scalar potential is modified to include the effects of motion.
   - The denominator in the potential expressions must include a term that accounts for the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \). The correct form is proportional to \( \frac{1}{d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \).
   - This ensures that the units are consistent and the motion of the charge is properly incorporated. The scalar potential becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is related to the scalar potential. Its general form is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]
   - This ensures that the vector potential is consistent with the scalar potential and satisfies Maxwell's equations.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the standard form of the vector potential for a moving charge.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \), but the scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which does not account for the motion of the charge.
   - **Option C:** Correct. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are expressed in terms of \( \frac{1}{d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} \), which correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect because the denominator in both potentials is \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which does not correctly account for the retarded effects of the charge's motion.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, \quad \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]

Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges move, they generate both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about potentials, not the fields directly. So I need to think about how potentials are expressed for a moving charge.

The setup is a charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, because the field at tr is what affects the point r at time t, since t > tr. So there's a retarded time involved here.

I think the scalar potential V is due to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. For a static charge, V would just be q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated.

Wait, for the scalar potential from a moving charge, it's not just the static solution anymore. I remember that the scalar potential can be expressed in terms of the retarded time. The scalar potential equation is something like (q/(4πε0)) multiplied by a term involving the distance and the speed. Or maybe it's more about the position and velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static case. I think the general expression for the scalar potential V(r, t) when the charge is moving is given by:

V(r, t) = q/(4πε0) * [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r + ... ) ]

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I remember that the scalar potential includes a term that accounts for the motion. Maybe it's related to the displacement vector d. Let me think. The displacement vector d is from the retarded position (where the charge was at time tr) to the current position r. So d = r - r', where r' is the position at time tr. So the magnitude of d is |d|.

But when the charge is moving, the potentials involve terms that depend on the velocity v of the charge. So perhaps the denominator in the potential expressions has a term involving c (speed of light) and the velocity.

In the options, I see expressions like (d c - d · v), or (d c + d · v). Oh right, I think the denominator comes from the term [d - (v/c²) t_r], but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, the expression for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is V = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v/c²) t_r)] but that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, I think the denominator is (d c) minus dot product of d and v, but scaled appropriately.

Looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v)), and option D has (d c + d · v). Hmm, which one is correct.

Wait, in the context of retarded potentials, the denominator is often (r - (v/c) t_r), but in terms of d and v, perhaps it would be something like d c - (d · v) because d is the vector from the retarded point to the current point r.

Wait, let me think about the exact form. The scalar potential for a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [1/(d - (v * t_r)/c²)]

But wait, t_r is the retarded time, which is the time it took for the influence to reach the point r. Alternatively, if the charge is moving, the position at the retarded time is r' = s(tr), and the vector from r' to r is d = r - r'.

In terms of velocity, v is the velocity at time tr, so v = dr'/dt evaluated at tr.

Hmm, perhaps the denominator should involve the term d c - (d · v) because when you consider the motion, you have to account for the time it takes the influence to travel. So maybe the denominator is (d c - (d · v)).

In terms of potentials, the scalar potential V would have this denominator multiplied by something. Let me look at the options.

Option C: V is qc over (4πε0 (d c - d·v)). Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v). So which is correct?

Wait, let me think about the units. The denominator must have units of length. Let's see, d has units of meters, v has units of m/s, and c is m/s. So d c would be meters * m/s = m²/s. Hmm, but that's not meters. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the denominator is d multiplied by c, minus the dot product of d and v. Let's compute the units: d (meters) times c (m/s) → m^2/s. The dot product d·v is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator has same units, so the overall expression is dimensionless. That can't be right because the denominator should be length. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d) but without the factors of c and so on. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the expression for the potentials in the context of retarded potentials.

I think the potentials for a moving charge involve terms like (r - (v/c^2) t), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by the Liénard expressions.

Wait, recalling the expressions for the potentials due to a moving charge:

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) [ 1 / |r - (v t)/c² | ] or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait no, more accurately, the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) [ 1 / ( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ].

Wait, or is it [1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]?

Wait, let me think about the expression for the scalar potential. When the charge is moving, the potential due to the charge at a point r at time t is not just 1/r but involves a term that corrects for the motion.

I remember that the electric field of a moving charge can be expressed as the gradient of the scalar potential plus the time derivative of the vector potential. But the potentials themselves are more complex.

Alternatively, for a charge in motion, the scalar potential is similar to the static case but modified by the motion. I think the expression involves (1 + (v/c)^2) or something like that in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential due to a charge in motion is given by the same expression as in the static case, but with r replaced by a sort of " retarded " position. So, perhaps it's V = (q/(4πε0)) * [ 1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ]

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I think the denominator in the potential expressions can be written as (d c - (d · v)), but scaled with appropriate factors to get the correct dimensions.

Wait, let's think about the denominator in the options. For option C, it's (d c - d · v). The unit of d is meters, c is m/s, so d c is m*(m/s) = m²/s. Similarly, d · v is (m)*(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator would be (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s, which is the same as (d c - (d · v)).

But for a potential, the denominator should have units of length, not m²/s. So perhaps there's a missing factor. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the terms. Let me think again. In the denominator, perhaps it's (d c) minus (v · d) — but where c is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (v · d)) multiplied by some factor. Wait, another thought: The term (d c - v · d) would be (d (c) - (d · v)).

Hmm, but the units don't add up. Maybe I'm missing some factors of time or other constants. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)/c), which would make the units correct.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Suppose d is in meters (m), c is m/s, v is m/s.

d * c → m*(m/s) = m²/s.

d · v → m*(m/s) = m²/s.

So (d c - d · v) → (m²/s - m²/s) = m²/s. But the denominator should be in meters because the potential is q/(4πε0 * something in meters). So (d c - d·v) can't be the denominator, because that would give 1/(m²/s) which is s/m, but we need 1/m.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (d c) - (v · d). Oh wait, that's what option C has. So let's see, but the units wouldn't add up. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d) multiplied by some other term, like 1/c or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (d c - v · d) divided by c, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lorentz transformation approach. The scalar potential transforms under Lorentz transformations. But I’m not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potentials in terms of the expressions when the charge is moving with velocity v. The potentials would then be functions that include terms of velocity.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is moving, the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity. So for a charge at rest, A is zero, but when it's moving, A is non-zero.

Looking at the options, A and B have A proportional to v² or v. Option C and D have A proportional to v.

So for a moving charge, A can't be zero, so options C and D are possible for A.

Now, the scalar potential. For a static charge, V is q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, V would have a more complicated form, possibly including terms with velocity.

So, let's look again at the options. Option C has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), and A as (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D has V as (qc)/(4πε0 (d c + d·v)), and A as (μ0 q v)/(4π (d c + d·v)).

Hmm, so both C and D have similar structures, but with a plus or minus in the denominator.

Wait, another thought: The displacement vector d is from the retarded position to the current position. So, when the charge is moving, the displacement is r - r', where r' is the position at time tr. So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

In the denominator, (d c - d · v) would involve the vector d multiplied by c, minus the dot product of d and v. So, perhaps this is related to the term (d c - v · d) which would be written as (d × (c)) · something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)).

Wait, maybe I can think of the term in the denominator as (d - (v/c^2) t_r) multiplied by c, leading to (d c - (v t_r)/c). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The potentials for a moving charge are given by the Lienard potentials. Let me try to recall their form.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε0)) [ 1/(r - (v t_r)/c²) ] or something like that. Wait, but r is the vector from the charge to the observation point at the current time. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the potentials can be written as:

V = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ], and A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c) [1/(r - (v/c²) t_r) ]

But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, looking for an expression involving (d c - d·v):

If d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, then d = r - r'(tr), where r'(tr) is the position of the charge at the retarded time.

So, r'(tr) = s(tr), and the vector from s(tr) to r is d.

So, if the charge is moving with velocity v at time tr, then the displacement in space due to the charge's motion over time (t - tr) is v (t - tr) + higher-order terms (assuming acceleration is not too large).

Wait, but the term (t - tr) is the time it takes for the influence to reach the observer from the point of emission. Hmm, perhaps the denominator in the potentials includes a term that accounts for the charge's motion during that time.

Alternatively, the denominator comes from the fact that the charge's position when it emitted the field was s(tr), but the field is observed at a later time, so the influence has to catch up with the moving charge.

Wait, I think the denominator would involve the term (d c - v · d) because when the charge is moving, the effective distance the field has to travel is not just d but adjusted by the component of the velocity in the direction of d.

Wait, if d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, then the time it takes for the field to reach the observer is approximately (d · v)/c², because the charge's velocity affects the position. Hmm, perhaps the denominator is (d c - v · d).

Wait, but let me think about the speed of light. The field emitted at time tr from the charge's position r' = s(tr) must travel the distance d to reach r. But if the charge is moving, then the field's position at time t would have to account for how much the charge has moved in the mean time.

Alternatively, the denominator would be d - (v (t - tr)), but with appropriate scaling.

Wait, maybe the denominator is (d c - v · d) divided by c. So if I have:

denominator = (d c - v · d)/c = d - (v · d)/c².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact form. Let's instead look at the options again.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)), A = (μ0 qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D: denominator is (d c + d·v).

Which one is correct? Let me think about the sign.

From the point of view of the displacement d, if the charge is moving away from the observation point, then the actual distance the field has to cover is longer, so the denominator would be larger, making the potential smaller. So, if the charge is moving in the same direction as d (d·v positive), the denominator would be larger (because d c - d·v could be smaller if d·v is positive, but wait, if d·v is positive, then d c - d·v would be smaller, which would make the denominator smaller, increasing the potential. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observer, d·v would be negative, so the denominator would be d c - (negative term), making it larger. So the potential would be smaller, which makes sense because the charge is approaching, so the effective distance is less.

Alternatively, I might be getting the signs mixed up. Maybe the denominator should be (d c + d·v), which would be the case in option D. If the charge is moving towards the observer, d·v would be negative, making the denominator smaller, leading to a larger potential. That might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)), which would adjust for the component of the velocity in the direction of d. So, if the charge is moving away, v and d are in the same direction, so v · d is positive, making the denominator larger, so V would be smaller. That makes sense because the charge is moving away, so the field would have to travel a longer distance.

Alternatively, if the charge is moving towards the observer, v · d is negative (because d points from the charge's position at tr to the observation point, so if the charge is moving towards the observer, v is in the direction opposite to d). So v · d would be negative, making the denominator smaller, so V would be larger. Which makes sense: the charge is closer now, so the potential is higher.

So, according to this reasoning, the denominator should be (d c - d·v), which is option C's denominator.

So, V would be (qc)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)).

Then, the vector potential A would be (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), which is option C's A.

But wait, why is the scalar potential multiplied by c? Because the denominator has units of length, right? Let me check the units.

Let me compute the units for option C's V:

(qc) has units of (C)*(m/s). 4πε0 has units of (C²/(N·m²)). So (qc)/[4πε0 (d c - d·v)] → (C*(m/s)) / [ (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the denominator's units:

(d c - d·v) → (m*(m/s) ) - (m*(m/s)) → (m²/s - m²/s) → m²/s. So denominator is [ (m²/s) ].

So numerator: (C * m/s).

Denominator: [ (C²/(N·m²)) ) * (m²/s) ) ] → (C²/(N·m²)) * (m²/s) ) = C²/(N·s).

So, V has units: (C * m/s) / (C²/(N·s)) ) → (N·s * m/s) / C → (N·m) / C.

But since 1 N·m = 1 J and 1 J/C = 1 V. So the units are volts, which matches. So the units for option C's V are correct.

For the A option:

μ0 has units of H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²).

So, (μ0 q c v) → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * C * (m/s) * (m/s) → kg·m³/(s^4·A²).

The denominator is same as before, [4π (d c - d·v)] → same as m²/s.

So, A's units: (kg·m³/(s^4·A²)) / (m²/s) ) → kg·m/(s^3·A²).

But the unit of A is Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla and A is related to B via B = ∇×A). Alternatively, the unit of A is Weber per square meter times meter → Weber per meter. Weber is V·s, so Weber per meter is (V·s)/m.

Wait, let me compute it another way. The unit of A is (kg·m/(s²·A))).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard expression for the vector potential.

The vector potential A has units of T·m² (tesla times square meters). But let's see the units based on the expression:

(μ0 q v ) / [ (d c - d·v) ]

μ0: H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²)

q: C = A·s

v: m/s

So, numerator:

μ0 * q * v → (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (A s) * (m/s) ) → kg·m²/(s²·A) * (1/s) ) → kg·m²/(s^3·A).

Denominator: (d c - d·v) → m²/s.

So overall, A's units: (kg·m²/(s^3·A)) ) / (m²/s) ) → (kg·m²/(s^3·A)) ) * (s/m²) ) → kg/(s^2·A).

Wait, what's the unit for vector potential A? Let me recall: The unit of A is Tesla·meter (T·m), because B is measured in Tesla, and A is integrated around a loop to give magnetic flux (B·A, which is in Weber, which is T·m²). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the Maxwell equations. The unit analysis might be getting too complicated, so I'll try to proceed with the assumption that option C is correct.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are related to the fields. The electric field E is related to the scalar potential by E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. The magnetic field B is ∇×A.

But since the charge is moving, we have to account for the vector potential and its time derivative. However, perhaps this isn't the easiest way to approach the problem.

Wait, perhaps the potentials are as follows: The scalar potential is (q/(4πε0)) * [ (1/(d c - d·v)) ] multiplied by c. So V = q c / [4πε0 (d c - d·v)].

Which would be option C's V.

Then, the vector potential A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)), which matches option C.

So, I think option C is the correct one.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is separated from the retarded position by the vector \( \vec{d} \). The potentials must account for the motion of the charge and the finite speed of light \( c \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a static charge, \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \). However, for a moving charge, the scalar potential is modified to include the effects of motion.
   - The denominator in the potential expressions must include a term that accounts for the displacement vector \( \vec{d} \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \). The correct form is proportional to \( \frac{1}{d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \).
   - This ensures that the units are consistent and the motion of the charge is properly incorporated. The scalar potential becomes:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is related to the scalar potential. Its general form is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
     \]
   - This ensures that the vector potential is consistent with the scalar potential and satisfies Maxwell's equations.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the standard form of the vector potential for a moving charge.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect because the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \), but the scalar potential \( V \) is given as \( \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which does not account for the motion of the charge.
   - **Option C:** Correct. The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are expressed in terms of \( \frac{1}{d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}} \), which correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion.
   - **Option D:** Incorrect because the denominator in both potentials is \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which does not correctly account for the retarded effects of the charge's motion.

### Conclusion:
The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in **Option C**:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}, \quad \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}.
\]
