Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using some spectroscopic data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the IR and 1H NMR data provided.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So for n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

Calculating: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three double bonds, or two double bonds and a ring, or one double bond and two rings, etc. But more likely, it's a benzene ring (which is three degrees right there) and perhaps another double bond or an amide group.

Looking at the IR data: Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are broad, probably N-H stretches from an amide or maybe an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or ketone. But wait, amides typically have a carbonyl around 1650 cm^-1, but maybe if it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups, it could be higher. Alternatively, esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740, so that's a strong possibility.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is likely a CH2CH3 group, the triplet suggests it's next to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3 or CH2CH2O-something.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an NH group, but as a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 2, which might not fit an NH2. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group, but why would that be broad? Or perhaps an amine group, but then again, the integration is 2, which is a bit confusing.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, 2H. A quartet usually means coupling with two neighboring protons. So, perhaps this is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Maybe it's part of an ester group, like OCH2CH3, but wait, the ethyl group is at 1.20 ppm as a triplet. So maybe the 4.5 ppm is another OCH2 group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions, each causing the protons to split into doublets.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. The substituents could be an amide group and another group like an ethoxy or an ester.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. Wait, but the substituents would be in meta positions, not para. So that might not fit the NMR, which suggests para substitution. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the benzamide is at the 4 position, with an ethoxy group. That would make the substituents in para positions. That fits the aromatic NMR. Let me think about the structure. The benzamide would have a CONH group at position 4, and an ethoxy group at position 4? No, wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents would be at 4 and something else. Wait, maybe the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ar-NH-CO-R, where R is something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. But looking at the NMR, the ethyl group is at 1.20 ppm, and the 4.5 ppm quartet seems like an OCH2 group. Wait, propionate would have a CH2CH2COO group. So maybe the ethyl is from the ester. But the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, 2H—could that be the NH of the amine?

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with a COOEt (ethyl ester) and an NH2 group at the para position. So the substituents would be at positions 4 (NH2) and 1 (COOEt), but actually, 4-aminobenzoate would have the COOEt and NH2 in the para positions.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR: the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which would happen if the substituents are para to each other. So for D, the benzene has a COOEt group and an NH2 group in para positions. That makes sense. Then the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. But wait, if the substituents are in para, then the aromatic protons would be at the ortho positions relative to each substituent. So for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (if we number that way), then each substituent would have two adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5), which would couple with each other.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in meta positions, but that would give a different splitting pattern. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

Now, considering the IR. If the compound is an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1650 cm^-1. But the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is more in line with an ester or a ketone. So perhaps the compound is an ester, not an amide.

Looking at the options again, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group and an NH2 group in para positions. So, the carbonyl in the ester would show up around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR data.

The 1H NMR: let's break down each peak.

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is the CH2CH3 group from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 suggests it's attached to a CH2. So OCOOCH2CH3? Wait, no, ethyl ester would be OCOOCH2CH3. Wait, wait, I think I got that wrong. The ethyl ester would be OCOOCH2CH3. So the OCH2CH3 group. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm, which is what we see. So that fits.

What about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That could be the NH2 group. Wait, but if it's an amine, we'd expect a peak around 1.5-3 ppm, but amines can show up as broad peaks. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is some other group. Wait, looking at D's structure: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester is at position 1, and the amino group at position 4.

Wait, wait, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – that's a quartet integrating to 2H. So maybe it's the OCH2 group from the ester. So the OCH2 in the ester would be next to the CH3, which is a triplet. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group with 3H. So the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data.

So that explains the 4.5 ppm quartet as the OCH2 from the ethyl ester.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – perhaps this is the amino group. But wait, amino protons in NMR usually are either broad singlets or multiplets. But the integration is 2H, which is a bit confusing because an amino group has two protons. So maybe this is the NH2 group. But the shift at 4.0 is a bit high for an NH2; amines are usually around 1-5 ppm but more like 1.5-3 for secondary amines, but primary amines can be upfield. Wait, but in D, it's an ethyl ester and an amino group. The amino group would be a primary amine. But in the NMR, the peak is a broad singlet. So perhaps it's the NH2 group.

Wait, but the coupling in the aromatic region. Let's think: if the benzene is 4-substituted with COOEt and NH2, then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (next to COOEt) and positions 3 and 5 (next to NH2). So the protons adjacent to COOEt would be deshielded and appear at higher ppm (like 8.0 ppm), and those adjacent to NH2 would be more shielded (like 7.0 ppm). So the doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to these positions. That makes sense.

So putting it all together:

IR shows ester carbonyl (1720 cm^-1) and possible N-H (broad bands at 3420 and 3325).

NMR shows ethyl group, ester OCH2, and two doublets for para-substituted benzene with substituents that deshield and shield the protons differently.

Looking at the options again:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That fits the NMR and IR data.

Wait, but what about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (CONH2) attached to a benzene that has an ethoxy group. The IR would show a carbonyl around 1650 cm^-1, which doesn't match the 1720. So this option is probably not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If propionate is the ester, then the structure would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the ethyl group would be longer. But the NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), which is typical for an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So if it's a propionate (CH2CH2COO-), the CH2 groups would be split differently. The triplet at 1.20 suggests a simple ethyl group, not a longer chain. So this might not fit.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group attached to the benzene at position 3. So the substituents would be ethoxy and amide in meta positions. The aromatic protons would likely be a triplet or something else, not two doublets. So the NMR suggests para substitution, so this is unlikely.

So the only option that fits all the data, especially the IR and the NMR, is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The compound C9H11NO2 has a molecular formula corresponding to a degree of unsaturation of 3, suggesting a benzene ring (3 degrees) and possibly a carbonyl group. The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, indicative of N-H stretches, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester. The ¹H NMR data provides further clues:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, consistent with a CH₂CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl ester.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, possibly corresponding to an NH₂ group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely the OCH₂ group of an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

Analyzing the options:

1. **Option A (3-ethoxybenzamide)**: This structure has a benzamide group and an ethoxy group in the meta position. However, the NMR data suggests para substitution, making this option unlikely.

2. **Option B (N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide)**: This structure has a formamide group and an ethoxy group in the para position. However, the IR data indicates a carbonyl group around 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more consistent with an ester than an amide. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C (4-aminophenyl propionate)**: This structure has an amino group and a propionate ester. However, the NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm, consistent with an ethyl group, not a longer propionate chain. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate)**: This structure has a para-substituted benzene ring with an ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) and an amino group (NH₂). The IR data matches the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the NMR data aligns with the ethyl group (1.20 ppm, t), the OCH₂ group (4.5 ppm, q), the NH₂ group (4.0 ppm, bs), and the para-substituted aromatic protons (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, d). This option fits all the data.

Based on the spectroscopic evidence, the compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using some spectroscopic data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the IR and 1H NMR data provided.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So for n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

Calculating: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 -14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three double bonds, or two double bonds and a ring, or one double bond and two rings, etc. But more likely, it's a benzene ring (which is three degrees right there) and perhaps another double bond or an amide group.

Looking at the IR data: Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are broad, probably N-H stretches from an amide or maybe an amine. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or ketone. But wait, amides typically have a carbonyl around 1650 cm^-1, but maybe if it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups, it could be higher. Alternatively, esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740, so that's a strong possibility.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is likely a CH2CH3 group, the triplet suggests it's next to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl group, like OCH2CH3 or CH2CH2O-something.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an NH group, but as a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 2, which might not fit an NH2. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group, but why would that be broad? Or perhaps an amine group, but then again, the integration is 2, which is a bit confusing.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, 2H. A quartet usually means coupling with two neighboring protons. So, perhaps this is a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Maybe it's part of an ester group, like OCH2CH3, but wait, the ethyl group is at 1.20 ppm as a triplet. So maybe the 4.5 ppm is another OCH2 group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 indicate coupling between adjacent protons. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions, each causing the protons to split into doublets.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. The substituents could be an amide group and another group like an ethoxy or an ester.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group in the 3 position. Wait, but the substituents would be in meta positions, not para. So that might not fit the NMR, which suggests para substitution. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the benzamide is at the 4 position, with an ethoxy group. That would make the substituents in para positions. That fits the aromatic NMR. Let me think about the structure. The benzamide would have a CONH group at position 4, and an ethoxy group at position 4? No, wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituents would be at 4 and something else. Wait, maybe the formamide is attached to the benzene. So the structure is Ar-NH-CO-R, where R is something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So that would be a benzene ring with an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. But looking at the NMR, the ethyl group is at 1.20 ppm, and the 4.5 ppm quartet seems like an OCH2 group. Wait, propionate would have a CH2CH2COO group. So maybe the ethyl is from the ester. But the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, 2H—could that be the NH of the amine?

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with a COOEt (ethyl ester) and an NH2 group at the para position. So the substituents would be at positions 4 (NH2) and 1 (COOEt), but actually, 4-aminobenzoate would have the COOEt and NH2 in the para positions.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR: the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which would happen if the substituents are para to each other. So for D, the benzene has a COOEt group and an NH2 group in para positions. That makes sense. Then the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. But wait, if the substituents are in para, then the aromatic protons would be at the ortho positions relative to each substituent. So for example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (if we number that way), then each substituent would have two adjacent protons (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5), which would couple with each other.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in meta positions, but that would give a different splitting pattern. So the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

Now, considering the IR. If the compound is an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1650 cm^-1. But the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm^-1, which is more in line with an ester or a ketone. So perhaps the compound is an ester, not an amide.

Looking at the options again, D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Its structure would be a benzene ring with a COOEt group and an NH2 group in para positions. So, the carbonyl in the ester would show up around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the IR data.

The 1H NMR: let's break down each peak.

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is the CH2CH3 group from the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.2 suggests it's attached to a CH2. So OCOOCH2CH3? Wait, no, ethyl ester would be OCOOCH2CH3. Wait, wait, I think I got that wrong. The ethyl ester would be OCOOCH2CH3. So the OCH2CH3 group. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2 ppm, which is what we see. So that fits.

What about the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)? That could be the NH2 group. Wait, but if it's an amine, we'd expect a peak around 1.5-3 ppm, but amines can show up as broad peaks. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is some other group. Wait, looking at D's structure: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester is at position 1, and the amino group at position 4.

Wait, wait, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – that's a quartet integrating to 2H. So maybe it's the OCH2 group from the ester. So the OCH2 in the ester would be next to the CH3, which is a triplet. So the OCH2 would be a quartet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group with 3H. So the OCH2 would appear as a quartet around 4.5 ppm, which matches the data.

So that explains the 4.5 ppm quartet as the OCH2 from the ethyl ester.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – perhaps this is the amino group. But wait, amino protons in NMR usually are either broad singlets or multiplets. But the integration is 2H, which is a bit confusing because an amino group has two protons. So maybe this is the NH2 group. But the shift at 4.0 is a bit high for an NH2; amines are usually around 1-5 ppm but more like 1.5-3 for secondary amines, but primary amines can be upfield. Wait, but in D, it's an ethyl ester and an amino group. The amino group would be a primary amine. But in the NMR, the peak is a broad singlet. So perhaps it's the NH2 group.

Wait, but the coupling in the aromatic region. Let's think: if the benzene is 4-substituted with COOEt and NH2, then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (next to COOEt) and positions 3 and 5 (next to NH2). So the protons adjacent to COOEt would be deshielded and appear at higher ppm (like 8.0 ppm), and those adjacent to NH2 would be more shielded (like 7.0 ppm). So the doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm would correspond to these positions. That makes sense.

So putting it all together:

IR shows ester carbonyl (1720 cm^-1) and possible N-H (broad bands at 3420 and 3325).

NMR shows ethyl group, ester OCH2, and two doublets for para-substituted benzene with substituents that deshield and shield the protons differently.

Looking at the options again:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That fits the NMR and IR data.

Wait, but what about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (CONH2) attached to a benzene that has an ethoxy group. The IR would show a carbonyl around 1650 cm^-1, which doesn't match the 1720. So this option is probably not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If propionate is the ester, then the structure would be OCOCH2CH2CH3. So the ethyl group would be longer. But the NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), which is typical for an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So if it's a propionate (CH2CH2COO-), the CH2 groups would be split differently. The triplet at 1.20 suggests a simple ethyl group, not a longer chain. So this might not fit.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group attached to the benzene at position 3. So the substituents would be ethoxy and amide in meta positions. The aromatic protons would likely be a triplet or something else, not two doublets. So the NMR suggests para substitution, so this is unlikely.

So the only option that fits all the data, especially the IR and the NMR, is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
