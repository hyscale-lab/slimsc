Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is about measuring observables P and Q in a particular order. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's a vector with three components. So I guess it's in a three-dimensional space, probably in a basis like the standard basis states |1>, |2>, |3>.

The matrix for operator P is given. Let me write it down:

P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, so the process is: first measure P, which gives 0, then measure Q, which gives -1. But wait, no, the way the question is phrased, I think it's the other way around. Wait, no: if you measure Q just after P, the order is P first, then Q. So the state after measuring P would be the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, from that state, you measure Q.

So to find the probability, I think I need to do two things:

1. Find the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P on the initial state.
2. Then, find the probability of measuring -1 for Q given that the state is now the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in P.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of projection.

Wait, but first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, especially the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the state as a vector, apply the projection onto the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0, find the probability, and then from that projected state, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the state after measuring P=0, then compute the expectation or probability for Q.

Wait, let's start with the initial state vector. The state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me normalize it, because states should be normalized. The norm is the square root of the sum of squares of the components.

Wait, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

But maybe I can proceed without normalizing yet. Let me see.

First, let's find all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Looking at P's matrix:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, what are the eigenvalues of this matrix? Let me think. It's a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues by looking for symmetry or patterns.

Wait, the matrix seems to have some symmetry. Let me see. The rows and columns are symmetric in some way. For instance, the first and third elements in the rows and columns have some symmetry, perhaps indicating that there are eigenvectors aligned along certain axes.

Alternatively, perhaps guess that there are eigenvalues of 1 and -1, and 0.

Wait, let's find the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps compute the eigenvalues.

But perhaps an easier approach is to find the eigenvectors. Let's look for eigenvectors by solving (P - λ I) v = 0.

So for each possible λ, solving (0 - λ, 1/√2, 0; 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2; 0, 1/√2, 0 - λ) times (v1, v2, v3) = 0.

This might be a bit involved, but let's try to find eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I can see that for λ = 0, the equations are:

Row 1: (0)(v1) + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + (0)v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero. Then from row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the general form is (a, 0, -a).

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize that vector.

The norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Hmm, so the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but are there other eigenvalues? Let's check for λ=1.

So for λ=1, the matrix (P - I) is:

Row 1: -1, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, -1, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -1.

So the equations are:

- v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1) = v2 - (1/√2)v3.

Wait, substituting v1 from the first equation into the second.

v1 = (1/√2) v2.

So substitute into the second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) ) - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0.

(1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2 v3) = 0.

Multiply all terms by 2√2 to eliminate denominators:

√2 v2 - 2√2 v2 + 2 v3 = 0.

Wait, √2 v2 from (1/2 v2)*2√2 = (1/2)(2√2) v2 )= √2 v2.

But I'm not sure that's the right approach. Let me compute:

(1/2 v2) - v2 = (-1/2 v2).

So equation becomes (-1/2 v2) + (1/√2 v3) )= 0.

Multiply both sides by 2√2:

-√2 v2 + 2 v3 = 0 → 2 v3 = √2 v2 → v3 = (√2/2) v2 = (1/√2) v2.

So from first equation, v1 = (1/√2) v2; third equation, v3 = (1/√2) v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1/√2, 1, 1/√2).

Wait, because if v2 =1, then v1 = 1/√2, v3=1/√2.

So the vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). Let's normalize this.

The norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ) → which simplifies to (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2). Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the norm of [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]:

(1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) )= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) = (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)).

But perhaps more accurately, the normalized vector is (1, √2, 1) scaled by 1/(sqrt( (1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (1)^2 )) )= 1/(sqrt(1 + 2 +1 )) = 1/sqrt(4) = 1/2.

So the vector is (1, √2, 1) * (1/2) = [1/2, √2/2, 1/2 ].

Alternatively, perhaps better to express the eigenvectors as:

Eigenvector for λ=1: (1, √2, 1)/2.

Wait, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Similarly, perhaps λ=-1 is also an eigenvalue, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1, given that the trace is zero.

Wait, the trace is zero. So if the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and we have 0, 1, -1, that adds to zero. So that could make sense.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

We want to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So this is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenspace for 0 is spanned by (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector is:

⟨e|ψ⟩, where e is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ) ] / sqrt(6).

Wait, wait. |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). So the actual components are (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So the inner product with e (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6) * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(6) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, wait. That calculation: let me redo it.

Compute e^† ψ:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) + (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-2) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3).

So the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector e, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the state becomes a multiple of e.

Now, we need to measure Q. So the state is e, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Q's matrix is diagonal:

[1 0 0;

0 0 0;

0 0 -1.]

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, because Q is diagonal.

So |1> is (1,0,0)^T, |2> is (0,1,0)^T, |3> is (0,0,1)^T.

The eigenvectors for Q=1 is |1>, Q=-1 is |3>, and Q=0 is |2>.

So the state after measuring P=0 is e = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared norm of the projection of e onto the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1, which is |3>.

Compute the inner product of e and |3>:

⟨3 | e⟩ = (0,0,1) * (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) ) = [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] / sqrt(2) )= (-1)/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. No, because when you measure P first, the state collapses, and then measure Q on the new state. So the probabilities aren't independent; the second measurement is done on the state after the first.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 in that order, which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the order of the measurements? The question says "measure Q just after the measurement of P." So P is measured first, then Q.

Yes, that's what I did: first P, then Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability as the product of the amplitude for P=0 and then for Q=-1 in the state after P=0.

Wait, so the probability is 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1 after that), giving 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

To solve the problem, we analyze the measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) in sequence. The initial state of the system is given as \( |ψ\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), which is normalized to \( |ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator \( P \) has the matrix representation:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared overlap between the initial state \( |ψ\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |e_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_0 | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle 1 | - \langle 3 | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -1 - 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle e_0 | ψ \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the eigenvector \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal, with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is \( |e_{-1}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared overlap between \( |e_0\rangle \) and \( |e_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is about measuring observables P and Q in a particular order. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that's a vector with three components. So I guess it's in a three-dimensional space, probably in a basis like the standard basis states |1>, |2>, |3>.

The matrix for operator P is given. Let me write it down:

P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, so the process is: first measure P, which gives 0, then measure Q, which gives -1. But wait, no, the way the question is phrased, I think it's the other way around. Wait, no: if you measure Q just after P, the order is P first, then Q. So the state after measuring P would be the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, from that state, you measure Q.

So to find the probability, I think I need to do two things:

1. Find the probability of measuring 0 when measuring P on the initial state.
2. Then, find the probability of measuring -1 for Q given that the state is now the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in P.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of projection.

Wait, but first, I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, especially the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the state as a vector, apply the projection onto the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0, find the probability, and then from that projected state, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the state after measuring P=0, then compute the expectation or probability for Q.

Wait, let's start with the initial state vector. The state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me normalize it, because states should be normalized. The norm is the square root of the sum of squares of the components.

Wait, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

But maybe I can proceed without normalizing yet. Let me see.

First, let's find all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

Looking at P's matrix:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Hmm, what are the eigenvalues of this matrix? Let me think. It's a 3x3 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues by looking for symmetry or patterns.

Wait, the matrix seems to have some symmetry. Let me see. The rows and columns are symmetric in some way. For instance, the first and third elements in the rows and columns have some symmetry, perhaps indicating that there are eigenvectors aligned along certain axes.

Alternatively, perhaps guess that there are eigenvalues of 1 and -1, and 0.

Wait, let's find the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps compute the eigenvalues.

But perhaps an easier approach is to find the eigenvectors. Let's look for eigenvectors by solving (P - λ I) v = 0.

So for each possible λ, solving (0 - λ, 1/√2, 0; 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2; 0, 1/√2, 0 - λ) times (v1, v2, v3) = 0.

This might be a bit involved, but let's try to find eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps I can see that for λ = 0, the equations are:

Row 1: (0)(v1) + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)v1 + (0)v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero. Then from row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the general form is (a, 0, -a).

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize that vector.

The norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Hmm, so the eigenvalue 0 has eigenvector (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but are there other eigenvalues? Let's check for λ=1.

So for λ=1, the matrix (P - I) is:

Row 1: -1, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, -1, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -1.

So the equations are:

- v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1) = v2 - (1/√2)v3.

Wait, substituting v1 from the first equation into the second.

v1 = (1/√2) v2.

So substitute into the second equation:

(1/√2)*(1/√2 v2) ) - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0.

(1/2 v2) - v2 + (1/√2 v3) = 0.

Multiply all terms by 2√2 to eliminate denominators:

√2 v2 - 2√2 v2 + 2 v3 = 0.

Wait, √2 v2 from (1/2 v2)*2√2 = (1/2)(2√2) v2 )= √2 v2.

But I'm not sure that's the right approach. Let me compute:

(1/2 v2) - v2 = (-1/2 v2).

So equation becomes (-1/2 v2) + (1/√2 v3) )= 0.

Multiply both sides by 2√2:

-√2 v2 + 2 v3 = 0 → 2 v3 = √2 v2 → v3 = (√2/2) v2 = (1/√2) v2.

So from first equation, v1 = (1/√2) v2; third equation, v3 = (1/√2) v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1/√2, 1, 1/√2).

Wait, because if v2 =1, then v1 = 1/√2, v3=1/√2.

So the vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2). Let's normalize this.

The norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2, so norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ) → which simplifies to (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2). Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the norm of [1/√2, 1, 1/√2]:

(1/√2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/√2)^2 = (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) )= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/√2, 1, 1/√2) / sqrt(2) = (1/(2), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(2)).

But perhaps more accurately, the normalized vector is (1, √2, 1) scaled by 1/(sqrt( (1)^2 + (√2)^2 + (1)^2 )) )= 1/(sqrt(1 + 2 +1 )) = 1/sqrt(4) = 1/2.

So the vector is (1, √2, 1) * (1/2) = [1/2, √2/2, 1/2 ].

Alternatively, perhaps better to express the eigenvectors as:

Eigenvector for λ=1: (1, √2, 1)/2.

Wait, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Similarly, perhaps λ=-1 is also an eigenvalue, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1, given that the trace is zero.

Wait, the trace is zero. So if the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and we have 0, 1, -1, that adds to zero. So that could make sense.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

We want to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So this is the squared norm of the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

The eigenspace for 0 is spanned by (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So the projection of |ψ> onto this eigenvector is:

⟨e|ψ⟩, where e is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So compute the inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1)(1) + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ) ] / sqrt(6).

Wait, wait. |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). So the actual components are (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So the inner product with e (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) is:

( (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2/sqrt(6) * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(6) * (-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, wait. That calculation: let me redo it.

Compute e^† ψ:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + ( (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) ) + (-1)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-2) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3), so denominator is 2 sqrt(3).

So the inner product is (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector e, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the state becomes a multiple of e.

Now, we need to measure Q. So the state is e, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Q's matrix is diagonal:

[1 0 0;

0 0 0;

0 0 -1.]

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, because Q is diagonal.

So |1> is (1,0,0)^T, |2> is (0,1,0)^T, |3> is (0,0,1)^T.

The eigenvectors for Q=1 is |1>, Q=-1 is |3>, and Q=0 is |2>.

So the state after measuring P=0 is e = (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is the squared norm of the projection of e onto the eigenvector of Q with eigenvalue -1, which is |3>.

Compute the inner product of e and |3>:

⟨3 | e⟩ = (0,0,1) * (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) ) = [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)] / sqrt(2) )= (-1)/sqrt(2).

The magnitude squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. No, because when you measure P first, the state collapses, and then measure Q on the new state. So the probabilities aren't independent; the second measurement is done on the state after the first.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 in that order, which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in the order of the measurements? The question says "measure Q just after the measurement of P." So P is measured first, then Q.

Yes, that's what I did: first P, then Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability as the product of the amplitude for P=0 and then for Q=-1 in the state after P=0.

Wait, so the probability is 1/3 (for P=0) multiplied by 1/2 (for Q=-1 after that), giving 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) in sequence. The initial state of the system is given as \( |ψ\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), which is normalized to \( |ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator \( P \) has the matrix representation:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared overlap between the initial state \( |ψ\rangle \) and the eigenvector \( |e_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_0 | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle 1 | - \langle 3 | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \left( -1 - 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle e_0 | ψ \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the eigenvector \( |e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal, with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is \( |e_{-1}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared overlap between \( |e_0\rangle \) and \( |e_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
\langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
\left| \langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
