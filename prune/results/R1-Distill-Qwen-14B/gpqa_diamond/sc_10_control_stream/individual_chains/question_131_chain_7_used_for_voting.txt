Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down step by step.

Alright, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key part is the NOESY NMR data. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay, I need to figure out the structure of the anhydride first, right? Because the reaction is between the anhydride and the cyclopentadiene.

So, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride by losing a molecule of water from adjacent carboxylic acid groups. But wait, if the starting acid has a cis-alkene, how does that affect the structure? Maybe the alkene is between the two carboxylic acid groups.

Wait, but when a diacid is dehydrated, it usually forms either an acid anhydride or possibly a cyclic anhydride. I think in this case, since it's a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride might have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, with the alkene being part of the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure because of the dehydration.

Let me think about the NMR data for the anhydride. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high shift, so maybe it's an aromatic proton or perhaps an olefinic proton. But wait, if the starting material had a cis-alkene, dehydration would form an anhydride, possibly an annulated ring with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is around where a carbon with a double bond (sp²) might be, and 165 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). So, for the anhydride, that makes sense because anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. But wait, in an anhydride, the carbonyls are typically around 170-185 ppm. Hmm, but 165 is a bit lower, maybe an ester or something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's not an anhydride but a cyclic structure like a cyclic diester or something else. Alternatively, the anhydride might have a structure where the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, lowering its chemical shift.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So all the protons in that environment are equivalent. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, or perhaps it's a proton on a ring that's symmetric.

Wait, another thought: for the anhydride, the structure might be such that there's a bridge or a ring, making the protons equivalent. For example, if it's a bicyclic structure, the protons could be all equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a bicyclic structure, like a bicyclo compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where all the protons are equivalent, such as a cyclopropane ring with substituents?

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a maleic anhydride analog. Wait, maleic anhydride has two double bonds, but in this case, the starting material is a cis-alkene. So dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond in the ring.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR. A single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a proton on a double bond, in a cis configuration, but it's a singlet. That would mean all the protons are equivalent. So maybe it's a bridgehead proton, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans configuration, but that wouldn't lead to a singlet. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7 ppm signal is not from a proton on the anhydride but from another group. Wait, but the anhydride's structure is such that all the protons in a certain environment are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopropane. If the anhydride is a cyclic structure with a three-membered ring, like a substituted cyclopropane, maybe the protons on the ring are equivalent, giving a singlet.

Alternatively, the anhydride could be a simple structure where all the non-carbonyl protons are in a single environment. For example, if the anhydride has two carbonyl groups and some equivalent groups attached, like methyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the reaction. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a diene, probably undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the anhydride as a dienophile.

Yes, that makes sense. Anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the reaction between the cyclopentadiene and the anhydride would form a six-membered ring via cycloaddition.

So the structure of the dienophile (the anhydride) will influence the product. Now, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That structure would have four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentene ring.

Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is the diene, but with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4? Hmm. So the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on 1,2,3,4. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has conjugated double bonds (positions 1-2 and 3-4), but the numbering would be 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond, making it a conjugated diene. Hmm, but adding methyl groups on 1,2,3,4 would make it a substituted diene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4, and methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the ring has four substituents, all methyl groups.

So when this diene reacts with the anhydride (the dienophile), they undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition to form a six-membered ring. The endo rule might influence the major product, but perhaps in this case, the structure of the dienophile and substituents affect the regiochemistry.

So the product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps with an oxygen bridge (from the anhydride) and substituents from the cyclopentadiene.

But wait, the molecular formula for both products is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular formula.

The anhydride is from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH, but with a cis-alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the anhydride would have the formula O=C-O-C-O=C- with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure, like a cyclic diacid anhydride. For example, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. So its structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: one between carbons 1-2 (O=C-O-) and another between 2-3 (double bond between two carbons, each attached to an oxygen).

But in this case, the NMR data is different. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. In maleic anhydride, the protons are in the 6-7 ppm range, but they are split into a pair of doublets because of the two equivalent protons on the double bond. But in this case, the 1H NMR is a single peak, which suggests that all the protons are equivalent. So maybe the dienophile is a structure where the protons on the double bond are all equivalent.

Alternatively, if the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, perhaps substituted in such a way that the two protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but wait. If the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, like having substituents that make the two protons on the double bond equivalent, that could lead to a singlet. For example, if the substituents are symmetrical, like two methyl groups, then the two protons would be equivalent and give a singlet.

So if the anhydride is something like (Z)-butenedioic acid anhydride, but that may not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the protons on the double bond are replaced by something else, like being part of a ring where they're all equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a bicyclo structure, making all the protons equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted compound where the two protons on the double bond are in an identical environment, leading to a singlet.

Wait, another approach: the dienophile has a single peak at 7 ppm (1H NMR), so perhaps it's a proton that's in a unique environment, but all equivalent. For example, maybe there are four equivalent protons, but that would integrate to four, not one. Or perhaps it's a single type of proton, like a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is not a proton on the dienophile but from elsewhere. Wait, but the dienophile is the anhydride, so perhaps it's a methyl group attached to the anhydride. Wait, if the anhydride has a methyl group, then the 1H NMR would show a singlet at around 1 ppm for methyl groups, but here it's at 7 ppm. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the dienophile has a conjugated system where the protons are all equivalent. Maybe a cyclopropane ring with an anhydride group. If the ring is symmetric, the protons would be equivalent and appear as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted cyclohexene or similar.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic compound like bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride or something similar. Such structures can have equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, and its structure has equivalent protons in certain positions. If the anhydride is attached in a symmetric way, the protons on the double bond might be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

For example, in endo-norbornene-dicarboxylic anhydride, the protons on the bridgehead would be equivalent. Wait, norbornene has a bridge, and the protons on the bridge could be equivalent, but the double bond is in a position that might not have protons. Wait, norbornene has a double bond in the bridge, so the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.

In this structure, the two bridgehead carbons (positions 1 and 4) would each have one proton. If the anhydride is formed between the two adjacent carboxylic acid groups, then the structure could have the two bridgehead protons being equivalent, leading to a singlet in the 1H NMR.

Wait, but norbornene's bridgehead protons are usually axial and equatorial, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In norbornene, the bridgehead positions (1 and 4) have one proton each. If the structure is symmetric, those two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. But where would they appear in the NMR?

In norbornene, the bridgehead protons are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. But the question says 7 ppm. Hmm, that's higher, more like a vinyl proton. So maybe the dienophile has a double bond with protons, which are equivalent and thus a singlet.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the singlet is at 7 ppm. So those would be vinyl protons. So if the dienophile has a double bond with two equivalent protons, that would give a singlet. For example, in a substituted cyclopropane with a double bond, but that's a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is 1,2-dimethylcyclobutene, but that might not form an anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted ethylene. For example, if the anhydride is a structure like O=C-O-CR2=CR2, where the substituents R are such that the two protons on the double bond (CR2 and CR2) are equivalent. So, for example, if the two groups on each CR2 are the same, the two protons would be equivalent and give a singlet.

Wait, but in that case, the two protons would be trans or cis, but in a symmetric environment, leading to a singlet. So perhaps the dienophile is a symmetric anhydride with a double bond, like a substituted maleic anhydride where the substituents are the same on both sides.

Alternatively, the dienophile could be a substituted cyclohexene with an anhydride group. But this is getting a bit vague.

Let me think about the cycloaddition. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, and methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the ring has four substituents, all methyl.

When this reacts with the dienophile (the anhydride), a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. The diene (cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile (anhydride) from either the endo or exo approach.

The product would be a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The substituents from the diene would be the methyl groups, and the dienophile would contribute the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

Wait, but the molecular formula for the products is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular formulas.

The anhydride (dienophile) must have a certain formula. Let's say the dienophile is a cyclic diacid anhydride. For example, butenedioic anhydride would be (HOOCCH2CH2COOH) losing water to form the anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's subtract the diene's formula to find the dienophile's formula.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The formula for cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) adds 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So the diene's formula is C5 + C4 = C9, H6 + H12 = H18. But wait, the structure is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Let me count the carbons: the cyclopentene has 5 carbons, and four methyl groups (each adds one carbon), so 5 +4=9 carbons, and each methyl has three hydrogens. The diene itself without substituents is C5H6. Each methyl adds three H and one C. So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So total formula is C9 H18.

Wait, but the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. So the actual structure is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups attached. The formula for this would be C9 H12. Because cyclopentadiene is C5 H6, and adding four CH3 groups: each CH3 adds one C and three H, so four CH3 add 4 C and 12 H. So 5+4=9 C, 6+12=18 H. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, cyclopentadiene is C5H6. When you add four methyl groups (each is CH3), each CH3 adds one C and three H. So four CH3 add 4 C and 12 H. So total is C5+4=9 C, and H6 +12=18 H. So the diene is C9 H18. Wait, but that seems too high. Because adding four methyl groups to a conjugated diene would have the formula C9 H14? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. Structure: it's a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, making it a conjugated diene. The formula is C5 H6. When you add four methyl groups, each CH3, to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So each of those carbons gets a methyl. So each methyl adds one C and three H, but the ring itself has a certain number of H already.

Wait, the cyclopentadiene before substitution has five H on the ring (since each carbon in the ring has one H except where the double bonds are). Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure of 1,3-cyclopentadiene is cyclopentene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Each carbon in a cyclopentene has two H if it's a CH2 group, but in a conjugated diene, the structure is more like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, with double bonds. Wait, no, that's not possible because a cyclopentene with two double bonds would have a non-aromatic structure, which is not possible for a five-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which would have a structure where the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a cumulene (allene). But that's not possible in a five-membered ring. So I think the correct structure is a conjugated diene, but I might be getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene with another double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the reaction.

The Diels-Alder reaction between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (anhydride) will form a six-membered ring. The dienophile's part (the anhydride) contributes two carbons (from the carbonyl groups), and the diene contributes four carbons. So the product will have 4 (from diene) + 2 (from dienophile) =6 ring carbons. Plus substituents.

But the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's subtract the diene's formula (C9 H18) from the product's formula (C13 H16 O3) to find the dienophile's formula.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder adds together the diene and dienophile, but without loss of any atoms. Wait, wait: the dienophile is the anhydride, which is derived from a diacid. Let's see: a diacid would be HOOC-(something)-COOH, and losing water forms the anhydride.

But perhaps I should calculate the dienophile's formula.

The product is C13 H16 O3. The diene is C9 H18. So the dienophile would contribute (C13 - C9) = C4, (H16 - H18) = H-2, and O3.

Wait, but that can't be right because the dienophile must have O in its formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the dienophile's formula.

The Diels-Alder product has the combined atoms of the diene and dienophile. So:

Dienophile: let's say it's an anhydride with formula Cx Hy O2 (since anhydrides are typically O2-containing). Because the dienophile is the product of dehydration of a diacid, which would lose two H2O molecules. Wait, no: dehydration of a diacid (HOOC-R-COOH) would lose one H2O to form a cyclic anhydride (O=C-O-R-C=O perhaps). So the formula of the anhydride would be (HOOC-R-COOH) minus H2O: so (HOOC-R-COOH) is Cn+2 H2n+2 O4, and the anhydride would be Cn+2 H2n O3.

But perhaps the dienophile (anhydride) is a five-membered ring, like maleic anhydride, which is C4 H2 O3.

Wait, maleic anhydride is (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) dehydrated? No, wait, maleic anhydride is actually the anhydride of maleic acid, which is HO2CCHCHCO2H. Dehydration forms a five-membered ring: O=C-(CHCH)-O-C=O. So the formula is C4 H2 O3.

So if the dienophile is C4 H2 O3, then the product formula would be diene (C9 H18) + dienophile (C4 H2 O3) = C13 H20 O3. But the product's formula is C13 H16 O3. That's a discrepancy of 4 H. Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps the dienophile is not maleic anhydride but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile has a different formula. Let me calculate:

Product formula: C13 H16 O3.

Dienophile formula: let's say it's Cm Hn O3.

Diene formula: diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's calculate that.

The base cyclopentadiene is C5 H6 (as a conjugated diene). Each methyl group adds (CH3), which contributes one C and three H. Four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So the diene's formula is C5 +4 C = C9, H6 +12 H=H18. So diene is C9 H18.

So the product is C13 H16 O3. So dienophile must contribute (13 -9) C =4 C, (16 H -18 H) = -2 H, and O3.

Wait, but dienophile can't have negative H. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, the dienophile is C4 H4 O3. Because then:

Dienophile: C4 H4 O3.

Diene: C9 H18.

Product: C9 +4 =C13, H18 +4 = H22. But product is H16. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I messed up the diene's formula. Let me try again.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The parent structure is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has the formula C5 H6. Each methyl group adds one C and three H. So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H.

So the diene's formula is C5 +4 C = C9, H6 +12 H = H18. So the diene is C9 H18.

The product is C13 H16 O3. Dienophile must contribute (13 -9)=4 C, (16 -18)= -2 H, and O3.

Wait, that can't be right because dienophile can't contribute negative H. So perhaps the dienophile has less H than the product.

Wait, another approach: the Diels-Alder reaction adds the diene (4 pi electrons) and the dienophile (2 pi electrons), forming a six-membered ring. The product would have the combined atoms of both reactants. So:

Product formula = diene formula + dienophile formula.

So, Product: C13 H16 O3.

Dienophile: ?

Diene: C9 H18.

So, dienophile must be C13 -9 = C4, H16 -18 = H-2, O3.

But negative H doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the diene's formula.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is not C9 H18. Let me recount.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

The base cyclopentadiene is C5 H6 (conjugated diene). Each methyl group is a CH3 substituent on the ring. Adding four CH3 groups: each contributes one C and three H. So 4*(CH3) adds 4 C and 12 H. So the diene is C5 +4=9 C, H6 +12=18 H. So diene is C9 H18, as before.

So the product has C13 H16 O3.

So dienophile must be C4 H-2 O3, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is not a simple anhydride. Maybe it's another compound. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. So the dienophile is the anhydride, which should have two carboxylic groups joined by an oxygen bridge.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a six-membered ring anhydride, like phthalic anhydride. Phthalic anhydride is C8 H6 O3. If the dienophile is phthalic anhydride, then:

Product formula would be diene (C9 H18) + dienophile (C8 H6 O3) = C17 H24 O3. But the product is C13 H16 O3. That's way too big. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a smaller anhydride, maybe maleic anhydride, which is C4 H2 O3. Then the product would be C9 +4 =13 C, H18 +2 =20 H, and O3. But the product is C13 H16 O3. So 20 H vs product's 16 H. So that's a discrepancy of four H.

Hmm, perhaps the dienophile is maleic anhydride, and in the Diels-Alder reaction, two H are lost (as water?), but I don't think DA reactions lose H; they're [4+2] cycloadditions, so no loss of H. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, but with less H. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile's formula is C4 H4 O3. Then diene is C9 H18, so product would be C13 H22 O3. Still not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the NMR data for the dienophile again.

The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests sp² hybridized protons, like vinyl protons.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is likely a sp² carbon (maybe a double bond), and 165 could be a carbonyl.

So the dienophile has a double bond (137 ppm) and a carbonyl (165 ppm). So perhaps it's a substituted ethylene with two carbonyl groups attached. For example, the dienophile might be a structure like O=C-R-CH2-C=O, but that might not form an anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two carbonyl groups and a double bond. Its 1H NMR shows two sets of doublets (the two protons on the double bond). But in this problem, the 1H NMR shows a single peak, so maybe the substituents on the double bond are symmetric.

So, if the dienophile is maleic anhydride, but with substituents that make the two protons equivalent, like having the same groups on both ends of the double bond.

Wait, for example, if the dienophile is (E)-butenedioic anhydride, but that might not be symmetric. Alternatively, if the substituents on the double bond are the same, like two methyl groups, then the protons would be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is something like (Z)- or (E)- substituted maleic anhydride with symmetric substituents. For instance, if the substituents are both methyl groups on each end of the double bond, the two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

So, if the dienophile is O=C-(CH2CH3)-CH2-C=O, but that's not an anhydride. Wait, no, the anhydride would have the structure O=C-O-C-O=C-. So, perhaps the substituents are attached to the oxygen atoms? Or perhaps the substituents are on the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride where the substituents on the double bond are the same. For example, O=C-O-CR2=CR2, where R is the same on both sides. Then the two protons on the double bond (CR2 and CR2) would be equivalent, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR.

So, in that case, the 1H NMR would show a singlet for the two equivalent protons. The integration would be 2H, but in the problem, it's a single peak, so maybe it's a quartet or something else. Wait, but the problem says a single peak, which could mean a singlet, but I'm not sure about the integration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton that's not on the double bond. Wait, but the 7 ppm is a high shift, more likely to be a double bond proton.

So, putting this together, the dienophile's structure has a double bond with two equivalent protons, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR.

Now, when this reacts with the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene), it forms a Diels-Alder adduct. The endo rule suggests that the more substituted product would be the major product.

Now, the two products have the same molecular formula, so perhaps they are diastereomers, or maybe they differ in the position of substituents.

The NOESY NMR data is about the major and minor products. NOESY detects through-space proximity, so a cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space. So in the major product, there's a cross-peak between two protons that are near each other in the structure.

In the major product, the cross-peak connects which two resonances?

Looking at the options:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, the cross-peak connects these two protons. So in the structure, the two protons (or groups) are close in space.

The options suggest that the cross-peak is between a singlet and another group.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state places the substituents on the same face, leading to certain stereochemistry. The substituents from the diene (methyl groups) and the dienophile (the anhydride's substituents) would be positioned in a certain way.

But perhaps the cross-peak is due to axial-equatorial protons or something else.

Wait, perhaps the cross-peak is between a methyl group (singlet at ~1 ppm) and another proton that's near it in space.

Option C is two singlets at ~1 and ~1.7 ppm, each integrating to 6H. That would suggest two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Option A is a 6H singlet (maybe methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (perhaps a bridgehead proton or an axial proton).

Alternatively, option B has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure.

The Diels-Alder product would have the diene's substituents (four methyl groups) and the dienophile's substituents (e.g., the anhydride's substituents, perhaps two more substituents) in positions around the six-membered ring.

Assuming the dienophile is symmetric, the substituents would be on opposite sides of the ring.

In the major product, which is the endo product, the substituents are positioned on the same face.

So, in the major product, there would be two sets of methyl groups: those from the diene and perhaps some from the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which, as we thought earlier, has a structure like O=C-O-C-O=C-. But perhaps in the Diels-Alder product, the two oxygen atoms are in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile contributes an oxygen bridge, and the substituents are the two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The adduct would have two ester groups (from the anhydride) attached to the six-membered ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to visualize the product.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with four carbons from the diene and two from the dienophile. The substituents from the diene (four methyl groups) would be on carbons 1 and 4 of the new ring (if the diene is the conjugated diene). The dienophile's substituents (the anhydride's groups) would be on carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, the dienophile's structure would have two carbonyl groups, so in the adduct, those would be positioned as ester groups on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the adduct has two ester groups attached to the ring, and the rest are the diene's substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the NOESY cross-peak. The major product has a cross-peak, so two protons are close in space, which suggests they are on adjacent atoms or in close proximity.

Option A connects a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (probably methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So, a methyl group and a proton that's next to it.

Option D connects a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. That might be an axial proton and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

Alternatively, the cross-peak could be between two methyl groups that are close, but that's not an option. Or between a methyl group and an adjacent proton.

Hmm. Another approach: the NOESY cross-peak suggests that these two protons are close in space, which often occurs when they are on adjacent carbons or in a ring structure.

Wait, in the major product, perhaps one of the substituents from the diene is near a proton from the dienophile's part.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product has a bridge or a ring where some protons are close in space.

Wait, the product's molecular formula is C13 H16 O3. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N:

(2*13 +2 -16 -0 +0)/2 = (28-16)/2=6. So 6 degrees: likely a ring and some double bonds. The Diels-Alder product has a six-membered ring (1 ring, 1 degree) and the anhydride part has two carbonyl groups (2 double bonds, 2 degrees). So 3 degrees from those, plus perhaps others. So the product might have a ring and two double bonds.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with a single ring, which is one double bond (since it's a cycloadduct), but wait, the Diels-Alder adds a conjugated diene and a dienophile, so the product has a six-membered ring with a single ring and perhaps a substituent double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a bridge, leading to another ring, which would account for more degrees of unsaturation.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the answer options again.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

A 6H singlet suggests six equivalent protons, perhaps two sets of three each, or a single group with six H, like two equivalent CH3 groups each contributing 3 H (but 3*2=6). So maybe two methyl groups.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule places substituents on the same face, so the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen groups) would be near the substituents from the diene.

In the major product, perhaps the two methyl groups from the diene are close to the oxygen-bearing CH2 group from the dienophile.

So, in the structure, the methyl groups are near the oxygen, leading to the cross-peak between the methyl and the CH2 protons.

If option B is correct, that would connect a 6H singlet (from two methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (from a CH2O group). If these are close in space, they would show a cross-peak in NOESY.

Alternatively, option D connects a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. That might be a bridgehead proton and a CH2O group.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the 1H NMR data in the major product. The cross-peak is between two resonances.

If the 6H singlet is at ~1.7 ppm, that's around where methyl groups attached to a ring or adjacent to an electronegative atom would appear. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or ester linkage.

So, in the structure, the two methyl groups (6H) are near the CH2O group, leading to their NOE interaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, and the 2H is from a CH2 next to an oxygen. If these are on the same face of the ring, they would be close enough for NOE.

So, in the major product (endo transition state), the substituents from the dienophile (like the CH2O groups) would be on the same face as the methyl groups from the diene. Thus, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product would be between the 6H methyl singlet and the 2H CH2O singlet.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, option B is a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So the cross-peak connects these two groups, meaning their protons are close in the structure.

In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are on the opposite face, making the NOE interaction very weak or absent. That would explain why the minor product lacks a cross-peak.

So the correct answer would be option B.

The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key distinction between the products is revealed by the 2D NOESY NMR spectra, where the major product shows a cross-peak, while the minor product does not. The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride (Dienophile):**
   - The anhydride is derived from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent vinyl protons, and its 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp² carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This suggests a symmetric anhydride structure, likely with a double bond and two carbonyl groups.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction:**
   - The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has four methyl groups and a conjugated diene system. The reaction with the anhydride forms a six-membered ring via a [4+2] cycloaddition. The major product is favored by the endo rule, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the ring.

3. **NOESY NMR Data:**
   - The NOESY spectrum detects through-space proximity between protons. In the major product, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are in close spatial proximity, likely due to the stereochemistry of the endo product. The minor product lacks this proximity, resulting in no or a weak cross-peak.

4. **Analysis of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial relationship in the major product.
   - **Option B:** A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom). This matches the expected proximity of methyl groups and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group in the major product.
   - **Option C:** Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups, which does not explain the cross-peak in the major product.
   - **Option D:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial relationship in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (CH2 group adjacent to oxygen). This is consistent with the stereochemistry of the endo product, where methyl groups and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group are in close spatial proximity.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down step by step.

Alright, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H spectrum has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key part is the NOESY NMR data. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay, I need to figure out the structure of the anhydride first, right? Because the reaction is between the anhydride and the cyclopentadiene.

So, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride by losing a molecule of water from adjacent carboxylic acid groups. But wait, if the starting acid has a cis-alkene, how does that affect the structure? Maybe the alkene is between the two carboxylic acid groups.

Wait, but when a diacid is dehydrated, it usually forms either an acid anhydride or possibly a cyclic anhydride. I think in this case, since it's a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride might have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, with the alkene being part of the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure because of the dehydration.

Let me think about the NMR data for the anhydride. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high shift, so maybe it's an aromatic proton or perhaps an olefinic proton. But wait, if the starting material had a cis-alkene, dehydration would form an anhydride, possibly an annulated ring with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is around where a carbon with a double bond (sp²) might be, and 165 is likely a carbonyl (C=O). So, for the anhydride, that makes sense because anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. But wait, in an anhydride, the carbonyls are typically around 170-185 ppm. Hmm, but 165 is a bit lower, maybe an ester or something else. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's not an anhydride but a cyclic structure like a cyclic diester or something else. Alternatively, the anhydride might have a structure where the carbonyl is part of a conjugated system, lowering its chemical shift.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So all the protons in that environment are equivalent. Maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl, or perhaps it's a proton on a ring that's symmetric.

Wait, another thought: for the anhydride, the structure might be such that there's a bridge or a ring, making the protons equivalent. For example, if it's a bicyclic structure, the protons could be all equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a bicyclic structure, like a bicyclo compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where all the protons are equivalent, such as a cyclopropane ring with substituents?

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a maleic anhydride analog. Wait, maleic anhydride has two double bonds, but in this case, the starting material is a cis-alkene. So dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond in the ring.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR. A single peak at 7 ppm. If it's a proton on a double bond, in a cis configuration, but it's a singlet. That would mean all the protons are equivalent. So maybe it's a bridgehead proton, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans configuration, but that wouldn't lead to a singlet. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7 ppm signal is not from a proton on the anhydride but from another group. Wait, but the anhydride's structure is such that all the protons in a certain environment are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopropane. If the anhydride is a cyclic structure with a three-membered ring, like a substituted cyclopropane, maybe the protons on the ring are equivalent, giving a singlet.

Alternatively, the anhydride could be a simple structure where all the non-carbonyl protons are in a single environment. For example, if the anhydride has two carbonyl groups and some equivalent groups attached, like methyl groups.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the reaction. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a diene, probably undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the anhydride as a dienophile.

Yes, that makes sense. Anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the reaction between the cyclopentadiene and the anhydride would form a six-membered ring via cycloaddition.

So the structure of the dienophile (the anhydride) will influence the product. Now, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That structure would have four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentene ring.

Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is the diene, but with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4? Hmm. So the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on 1,2,3,4. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has conjugated double bonds (positions 1-2 and 3-4), but the numbering would be 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond, making it a conjugated diene. Hmm, but adding methyl groups on 1,2,3,4 would make it a substituted diene.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4, and methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the ring has four substituents, all methyl groups.

So when this diene reacts with the anhydride (the dienophile), they undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition to form a six-membered ring. The endo rule might influence the major product, but perhaps in this case, the structure of the dienophile and substituents affect the regiochemistry.

So the product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps with an oxygen bridge (from the anhydride) and substituents from the cyclopentadiene.

But wait, the molecular formula for both products is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular formula.

The anhydride is from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH, but with a cis-alkene. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the anhydride would have the formula O=C-O-C-O=C- with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure, like a cyclic diacid anhydride. For example, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. So its structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: one between carbons 1-2 (O=C-O-) and another between 2-3 (double bond between two carbons, each attached to an oxygen).

But in this case, the NMR data is different. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. In maleic anhydride, the protons are in the 6-7 ppm range, but they are split into a pair of doublets because of the two equivalent protons on the double bond. But in this case, the 1H NMR is a single peak, which suggests that all the protons are equivalent. So maybe the dienophile is a structure where the protons on the double bond are all equivalent.

Alternatively, if the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, perhaps substituted in such a way that the two protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but wait. If the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, like having substituents that make the two protons on the double bond equivalent, that could lead to a singlet. For example, if the substituents are symmetrical, like two methyl groups, then the two protons would be equivalent and give a singlet.

So if the anhydride is something like (Z)-butenedioic acid anhydride, but that may not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the protons on the double bond are replaced by something else, like being part of a ring where they're all equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is a bicyclo structure, making all the protons equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted compound where the two protons on the double bond are in an identical environment, leading to a singlet.

Wait, another approach: the dienophile has a single peak at 7 ppm (1H NMR), so perhaps it's a proton that's in a unique environment, but all equivalent. For example, maybe there are four equivalent protons, but that would integrate to four, not one. Or perhaps it's a single type of proton, like a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm peak is not a proton on the dienophile but from elsewhere. Wait, but the dienophile is the anhydride, so perhaps it's a methyl group attached to the anhydride. Wait, if the anhydride has a methyl group, then the 1H NMR would show a singlet at around 1 ppm for methyl groups, but here it's at 7 ppm. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the dienophile has a conjugated system where the protons are all equivalent. Maybe a cyclopropane ring with an anhydride group. If the ring is symmetric, the protons would be equivalent and appear as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted cyclohexene or similar.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic compound like bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride or something similar. Such structures can have equivalent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, and its structure has equivalent protons in certain positions. If the anhydride is attached in a symmetric way, the protons on the double bond might be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

For example, in endo-norbornene-dicarboxylic anhydride, the protons on the bridgehead would be equivalent. Wait, norbornene has a bridge, and the protons on the bridge could be equivalent, but the double bond is in a position that might not have protons. Wait, norbornene has a double bond in the bridge, so the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.

In this structure, the two bridgehead carbons (positions 1 and 4) would each have one proton. If the anhydride is formed between the two adjacent carboxylic acid groups, then the structure could have the two bridgehead protons being equivalent, leading to a singlet in the 1H NMR.

Wait, but norbornene's bridgehead protons are usually axial and equatorial, but I'm not sure. Let me think. In norbornene, the bridgehead positions (1 and 4) have one proton each. If the structure is symmetric, those two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. But where would they appear in the NMR?

In norbornene, the bridgehead protons are typically around 1.5-2.5 ppm. But the question says 7 ppm. Hmm, that's higher, more like a vinyl proton. So maybe the dienophile has a double bond with protons, which are equivalent and thus a singlet.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the singlet is at 7 ppm. So those would be vinyl protons. So if the dienophile has a double bond with two equivalent protons, that would give a singlet. For example, in a substituted cyclopropane with a double bond, but that's a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is 1,2-dimethylcyclobutene, but that might not form an anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted ethylene. For example, if the anhydride is a structure like O=C-O-CR2=CR2, where the substituents R are such that the two protons on the double bond (CR2 and CR2) are equivalent. So, for example, if the two groups on each CR2 are the same, the two protons would be equivalent and give a singlet.

Wait, but in that case, the two protons would be trans or cis, but in a symmetric environment, leading to a singlet. So perhaps the dienophile is a symmetric anhydride with a double bond, like a substituted maleic anhydride where the substituents are the same on both sides.

Alternatively, the dienophile could be a substituted cyclohexene with an anhydride group. But this is getting a bit vague.

Let me think about the cycloaddition. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, and methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the ring has four substituents, all methyl.

When this reacts with the dienophile (the anhydride), a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. The diene (cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile (anhydride) from either the endo or exo approach.

The product would be a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile. The substituents from the diene would be the methyl groups, and the dienophile would contribute the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

Wait, but the molecular formula for the products is C13H16O3. Let me calculate the molecular formulas.

The anhydride (dienophile) must have a certain formula. Let's say the dienophile is a cyclic diacid anhydride. For example, butenedioic anhydride would be (HOOCCH2CH2COOH) losing water to form the anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's subtract the diene's formula to find the dienophile's formula.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The formula for cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each -CH3) adds 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So the diene's formula is C5 + C4 = C9, H6 + H12 = H18. But wait, the structure is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Let me count the carbons: the cyclopentene has 5 carbons, and four methyl groups (each adds one carbon), so 5 +4=9 carbons, and each methyl has three hydrogens. The diene itself without substituents is C5H6. Each methyl adds three H and one C. So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So total formula is C9 H18.

Wait, but the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. So the actual structure is a five-membered ring with four methyl groups attached. The formula for this would be C9 H12. Because cyclopentadiene is C5 H6, and adding four CH3 groups: each CH3 adds one C and three H, so four CH3 add 4 C and 12 H. So 5+4=9 C, 6+12=18 H. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, cyclopentadiene is C5H6. When you add four methyl groups (each is CH3), each CH3 adds one C and three H. So four CH3 add 4 C and 12 H. So total is C5+4=9 C, and H6 +12=18 H. So the diene is C9 H18. Wait, but that seems too high. Because adding four methyl groups to a conjugated diene would have the formula C9 H14? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. Structure: it's a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, making it a conjugated diene. The formula is C5 H6. When you add four methyl groups, each CH3, to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. So each of those carbons gets a methyl. So each methyl adds one C and three H, but the ring itself has a certain number of H already.

Wait, the cyclopentadiene before substitution has five H on the ring (since each carbon in the ring has one H except where the double bonds are). Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure of 1,3-cyclopentadiene is cyclopentene with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Each carbon in a cyclopentene has two H if it's a CH2 group, but in a conjugated diene, the structure is more like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, with double bonds. Wait, no, that's not possible because a cyclopentene with two double bonds would have a non-aromatic structure, which is not possible for a five-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which would have a structure where the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a cumulene (allene). But that's not possible in a five-membered ring. So I think the correct structure is a conjugated diene, but I might be getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentene with another double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead think about the reaction.

The Diels-Alder reaction between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (anhydride) will form a six-membered ring. The dienophile's part (the anhydride) contributes two carbons (from the carbonyl groups), and the diene contributes four carbons. So the product will have 4 (from diene) + 2 (from dienophile) =6 ring carbons. Plus substituents.

But the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's subtract the diene's formula (C9 H18) from the product's formula (C13 H16 O3) to find the dienophile's formula.

Wait, no. The Diels-Alder adds together the diene and dienophile, but without loss of any atoms. Wait, wait: the dienophile is the anhydride, which is derived from a diacid. Let's see: a diacid would be HOOC-(something)-COOH, and losing water forms the anhydride.

But perhaps I should calculate the dienophile's formula.

The product is C13 H16 O3. The diene is C9 H18. So the dienophile would contribute (C13 - C9) = C4, (H16 - H18) = H-2, and O3.

Wait, but that can't be right because the dienophile must have O in its formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the dienophile's formula.

The Diels-Alder product has the combined atoms of the diene and dienophile. So:

Dienophile: let's say it's an anhydride with formula Cx Hy O2 (since anhydrides are typically O2-containing). Because the dienophile is the product of dehydration of a diacid, which would lose two H2O molecules. Wait, no: dehydration of a diacid (HOOC-R-COOH) would lose one H2O to form a cyclic anhydride (O=C-O-R-C=O perhaps). So the formula of the anhydride would be (HOOC-R-COOH) minus H2O: so (HOOC-R-COOH) is Cn+2 H2n+2 O4, and the anhydride would be Cn+2 H2n O3.

But perhaps the dienophile (anhydride) is a five-membered ring, like maleic anhydride, which is C4 H2 O3.

Wait, maleic anhydride is (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) dehydrated? No, wait, maleic anhydride is actually the anhydride of maleic acid, which is HO2CCHCHCO2H. Dehydration forms a five-membered ring: O=C-(CHCH)-O-C=O. So the formula is C4 H2 O3.

So if the dienophile is C4 H2 O3, then the product formula would be diene (C9 H18) + dienophile (C4 H2 O3) = C13 H20 O3. But the product's formula is C13 H16 O3. That's a discrepancy of 4 H. Hmm. So that suggests that perhaps the dienophile is not maleic anhydride but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile has a different formula. Let me calculate:

Product formula: C13 H16 O3.

Dienophile formula: let's say it's Cm Hn O3.

Diene formula: diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's calculate that.

The base cyclopentadiene is C5 H6 (as a conjugated diene). Each methyl group adds (CH3), which contributes one C and three H. Four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So the diene's formula is C5 +4 C = C9, H6 +12 H=H18. So diene is C9 H18.

So the product is C13 H16 O3. So dienophile must contribute (13 -9) C =4 C, (16 H -18 H) = -2 H, and O3.

Wait, but dienophile can't have negative H. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, the dienophile is C4 H4 O3. Because then:

Dienophile: C4 H4 O3.

Diene: C9 H18.

Product: C9 +4 =C13, H18 +4 = H22. But product is H16. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I messed up the diene's formula. Let me try again.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The parent structure is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has the formula C5 H6. Each methyl group adds one C and three H. So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H.

So the diene's formula is C5 +4 C = C9, H6 +12 H = H18. So the diene is C9 H18.

The product is C13 H16 O3. Dienophile must contribute (13 -9)=4 C, (16 -18)= -2 H, and O3.

Wait, that can't be right because dienophile can't contribute negative H. So perhaps the dienophile has less H than the product.

Wait, another approach: the Diels-Alder reaction adds the diene (4 pi electrons) and the dienophile (2 pi electrons), forming a six-membered ring. The product would have the combined atoms of both reactants. So:

Product formula = diene formula + dienophile formula.

So, Product: C13 H16 O3.

Dienophile: ?

Diene: C9 H18.

So, dienophile must be C13 -9 = C4, H16 -18 = H-2, O3.

But negative H doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the diene's formula.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is not C9 H18. Let me recount.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

The base cyclopentadiene is C5 H6 (conjugated diene). Each methyl group is a CH3 substituent on the ring. Adding four CH3 groups: each contributes one C and three H. So 4*(CH3) adds 4 C and 12 H. So the diene is C5 +4=9 C, H6 +12=18 H. So diene is C9 H18, as before.

So the product has C13 H16 O3.

So dienophile must be C4 H-2 O3, which is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is not a simple anhydride. Maybe it's another compound. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid, which is dehydrated to an anhydride. So the dienophile is the anhydride, which should have two carboxylic groups joined by an oxygen bridge.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a six-membered ring anhydride, like phthalic anhydride. Phthalic anhydride is C8 H6 O3. If the dienophile is phthalic anhydride, then:

Product formula would be diene (C9 H18) + dienophile (C8 H6 O3) = C17 H24 O3. But the product is C13 H16 O3. That's way too big. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a smaller anhydride, maybe maleic anhydride, which is C4 H2 O3. Then the product would be C9 +4 =13 C, H18 +2 =20 H, and O3. But the product is C13 H16 O3. So 20 H vs product's 16 H. So that's a discrepancy of four H.

Hmm, perhaps the dienophile is maleic anhydride, and in the Diels-Alder reaction, two H are lost (as water?), but I don't think DA reactions lose H; they're [4+2] cycloadditions, so no loss of H. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride, but with less H. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is something else.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile's formula is C4 H4 O3. Then diene is C9 H18, so product would be C13 H22 O3. Still not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the NMR data for the dienophile again.

The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests sp² hybridized protons, like vinyl protons.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is likely a sp² carbon (maybe a double bond), and 165 could be a carbonyl.

So the dienophile has a double bond (137 ppm) and a carbonyl (165 ppm). So perhaps it's a substituted ethylene with two carbonyl groups attached. For example, the dienophile might be a structure like O=C-R-CH2-C=O, but that might not form an anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride has two carbonyl groups and a double bond. Its 1H NMR shows two sets of doublets (the two protons on the double bond). But in this problem, the 1H NMR shows a single peak, so maybe the substituents on the double bond are symmetric.

So, if the dienophile is maleic anhydride, but with substituents that make the two protons equivalent, like having the same groups on both ends of the double bond.

Wait, for example, if the dienophile is (E)-butenedioic anhydride, but that might not be symmetric. Alternatively, if the substituents on the double bond are the same, like two methyl groups, then the protons would be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is something like (Z)- or (E)- substituted maleic anhydride with symmetric substituents. For instance, if the substituents are both methyl groups on each end of the double bond, the two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

So, if the dienophile is O=C-(CH2CH3)-CH2-C=O, but that's not an anhydride. Wait, no, the anhydride would have the structure O=C-O-C-O=C-. So, perhaps the substituents are attached to the oxygen atoms? Or perhaps the substituents are on the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted maleic anhydride where the substituents on the double bond are the same. For example, O=C-O-CR2=CR2, where R is the same on both sides. Then the two protons on the double bond (CR2 and CR2) would be equivalent, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR.

So, in that case, the 1H NMR would show a singlet for the two equivalent protons. The integration would be 2H, but in the problem, it's a single peak, so maybe it's a quartet or something else. Wait, but the problem says a single peak, which could mean a singlet, but I'm not sure about the integration.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton that's not on the double bond. Wait, but the 7 ppm is a high shift, more likely to be a double bond proton.

So, putting this together, the dienophile's structure has a double bond with two equivalent protons, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR.

Now, when this reacts with the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene), it forms a Diels-Alder adduct. The endo rule suggests that the more substituted product would be the major product.

Now, the two products have the same molecular formula, so perhaps they are diastereomers, or maybe they differ in the position of substituents.

The NOESY NMR data is about the major and minor products. NOESY detects through-space proximity, so a cross-peak indicates that two protons are close to each other in space. So in the major product, there's a cross-peak between two protons that are near each other in the structure.

In the major product, the cross-peak connects which two resonances?

Looking at the options:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So, the cross-peak connects these two protons. So in the structure, the two protons (or groups) are close in space.

The options suggest that the cross-peak is between a singlet and another group.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state places the substituents on the same face, leading to certain stereochemistry. The substituents from the diene (methyl groups) and the dienophile (the anhydride's substituents) would be positioned in a certain way.

But perhaps the cross-peak is due to axial-equatorial protons or something else.

Wait, perhaps the cross-peak is between a methyl group (singlet at ~1 ppm) and another proton that's near it in space.

Option C is two singlets at ~1 and ~1.7 ppm, each integrating to 6H. That would suggest two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Option A is a 6H singlet (maybe methyl groups) and a 1H doublet (perhaps a bridgehead proton or an axial proton).

Alternatively, option B has a 6H singlet and a 2H singlet.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure.

The Diels-Alder product would have the diene's substituents (four methyl groups) and the dienophile's substituents (e.g., the anhydride's substituents, perhaps two more substituents) in positions around the six-membered ring.

Assuming the dienophile is symmetric, the substituents would be on opposite sides of the ring.

In the major product, which is the endo product, the substituents are positioned on the same face.

So, in the major product, there would be two sets of methyl groups: those from the diene and perhaps some from the dienophile.

Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which, as we thought earlier, has a structure like O=C-O-C-O=C-. But perhaps in the Diels-Alder product, the two oxygen atoms are in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile contributes an oxygen bridge, and the substituents are the two carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The adduct would have two ester groups (from the anhydride) attached to the six-membered ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to visualize the product.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with four carbons from the diene and two from the dienophile. The substituents from the diene (four methyl groups) would be on carbons 1 and 4 of the new ring (if the diene is the conjugated diene). The dienophile's substituents (the anhydride's groups) would be on carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, the dienophile's structure would have two carbonyl groups, so in the adduct, those would be positioned as ester groups on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the adduct has two ester groups attached to the ring, and the rest are the diene's substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the NOESY cross-peak. The major product has a cross-peak, so two protons are close in space, which suggests they are on adjacent atoms or in close proximity.

Option A connects a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (probably methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. So, a methyl group and a proton that's next to it.

Option D connects a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. That might be an axial proton and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

Alternatively, the cross-peak could be between two methyl groups that are close, but that's not an option. Or between a methyl group and an adjacent proton.

Hmm. Another approach: the NOESY cross-peak suggests that these two protons are close in space, which often occurs when they are on adjacent carbons or in a ring structure.

Wait, in the major product, perhaps one of the substituents from the diene is near a proton from the dienophile's part.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product has a bridge or a ring where some protons are close in space.

Wait, the product's molecular formula is C13 H16 O3. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N:

(2*13 +2 -16 -0 +0)/2 = (28-16)/2=6. So 6 degrees: likely a ring and some double bonds. The Diels-Alder product has a six-membered ring (1 ring, 1 degree) and the anhydride part has two carbonyl groups (2 double bonds, 2 degrees). So 3 degrees from those, plus perhaps others. So the product might have a ring and two double bonds.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring with a single ring, which is one double bond (since it's a cycloadduct), but wait, the Diels-Alder adds a conjugated diene and a dienophile, so the product has a six-membered ring with a single ring and perhaps a substituent double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a bridge, leading to another ring, which would account for more degrees of unsaturation.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the answer options again.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

A 6H singlet suggests six equivalent protons, perhaps two sets of three each, or a single group with six H, like two equivalent CH3 groups each contributing 3 H (but 3*2=6). So maybe two methyl groups.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule places substituents on the same face, so the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen groups) would be near the substituents from the diene.

In the major product, perhaps the two methyl groups from the diene are close to the oxygen-bearing CH2 group from the dienophile.

So, in the structure, the methyl groups are near the oxygen, leading to the cross-peak between the methyl and the CH2 protons.

If option B is correct, that would connect a 6H singlet (from two methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (from a CH2O group). If these are close in space, they would show a cross-peak in NOESY.

Alternatively, option D connects a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. That might be a bridgehead proton and a CH2O group.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the 1H NMR data in the major product. The cross-peak is between two resonances.

If the 6H singlet is at ~1.7 ppm, that's around where methyl groups attached to a ring or adjacent to an electronegative atom would appear. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or ester linkage.

So, in the structure, the two methyl groups (6H) are near the CH2O group, leading to their NOE interaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, and the 2H is from a CH2 next to an oxygen. If these are on the same face of the ring, they would be close enough for NOE.

So, in the major product (endo transition state), the substituents from the dienophile (like the CH2O groups) would be on the same face as the methyl groups from the diene. Thus, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product would be between the 6H methyl singlet and the 2H CH2O singlet.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, option B is a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So the cross-peak connects these two groups, meaning their protons are close in the structure.

In the minor product, perhaps the substituents are on the opposite face, making the NOE interaction very weak or absent. That would explain why the minor product lacks a cross-peak.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key distinction between the products is revealed by the 2D NOESY NMR spectra, where the major product shows a cross-peak, while the minor product does not. The task is to identify which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride (Dienophile):**
   - The anhydride is derived from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent vinyl protons, and its 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp² carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This suggests a symmetric anhydride structure, likely with a double bond and two carbonyl groups.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction:**
   - The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has four methyl groups and a conjugated diene system. The reaction with the anhydride forms a six-membered ring via a [4+2] cycloaddition. The major product is favored by the endo rule, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the ring.

3. **NOESY NMR Data:**
   - The NOESY spectrum detects through-space proximity between protons. In the major product, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are in close spatial proximity, likely due to the stereochemistry of the endo product. The minor product lacks this proximity, resulting in no or a weak cross-peak.

4. **Analysis of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial relationship in the major product.
   - **Option B:** A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom). This matches the expected proximity of methyl groups and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group in the major product.
   - **Option C:** Two 6H singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups, which does not explain the cross-peak in the major product.
   - **Option D:** A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial relationship in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (CH2 group adjacent to oxygen). This is consistent with the stereochemistry of the endo product, where methyl groups and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group are in close spatial proximity.

**Answer: B**
