Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum. 

Hmm, let's tackle each step one by one. 

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I've heard that when vicinal dihalides (like dibromides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions, typically E2 mechanisms. So, elimination would form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent positions. When KOH is used in elimination, it should form an alkene. 

Wait, but wait. If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination leads to a bridge structure. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the elimination would form a double bond between the two carbon atoms where the bromines were. So, the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is part of a bridge. The 1 and 3 positions might be adjacent in such a way that elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. 

Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule says that double bonds don't form at bridgehead positions in bicyclic compounds unless the ring is large enough to accommodate the strain. Adamantane has a structure that's four fused cyclohexane rings, right? So, if the elimination occurs across two bridgehead carbons, perhaps it can form a double bond. I think adamantane's structure allows for bridgehead double bonds because of its diamond-like structure. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something like that. 

The NMR data for product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but product 1 is from elimination, which should form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Oh wait, KOH could be in a different condition? Or perhaps it's not elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1650 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with excess KOH and high temperature, substitution is less likely because E2 is favored. 

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is that KOH could cause a cleavage of the C-Br bond. Wait, if there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so when treated with a strong base, it would eliminate to form an alkene. But earlier I thought product 1 has a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. But wait, how would that happen from a dihalide? Oh! Wait a minute, perhaps it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination is a cyclopropane or something else. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the IR data again. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. Wait, but substitution would likely require a good leaving group and perhaps a different mechanism. But KOH is a strong base, and high temperatures usually favor elimination. Hmm. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a gem-diolate, which then undergoes elimination. Oh wait, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Wait, no, the product has a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. 

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH forms an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Epoxides form from dihalides via epoxidation, but that would require specific conditions, maybe like a peracid, which isn't the case here. 

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, in some cases, vicinal dihalides can undergo elimination to form ketones, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where two eliminations occur to form a carbonyl. So, each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps two eliminations across adjacent positions would form a carbonyl. 

Wait, maybe it's a cleavage reaction. Vicinal dihalides can undergo cleavage with strong bases to form ketones or other carbonyl compounds. Oh! Yes, the cleavage of vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihaloalkanes) with strong bases can produce ketones if the starting material was a geminal dihalide. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, not geminal. Hmm. So perhaps that's not it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via a two-step elimination. Wait, if each Br is removed, perhaps forming two H's and a double bond, but I'm stuck. 

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product 1 is not an alkene but a ketone. So, how does that happen? Maybe via a radical mechanism? I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe I should look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet. 4.79 is in the range for an -OH group, but wait, is it a singlet? Or maybe it's an -O- group. Alternatively, it could be a diastereotopic pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm might be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH2-O. But considering the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is C=O, maybe product 1 is a ketone. 

So imagining that, perhaps product 1 is adamantanone. Adamantanone is a ketone formed by the elimination of two equivalents of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, the reaction would be: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH → adamantanone + 2 KBr + H2O. 

Wait, but how does that elimination happen? Each Br is removed, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. That makes sense. So, each Br is on adjacent carbons, and elimination of HBr twice would form a carbonyl group. 

So, product 1 is adamantanone. Then, the NMR would have a peak for the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me think about the structure of adamantanone. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused in a diamond shape. The position of the carbonyl in adamantanone is at a bridgehead. So, the structure would have the carbonyl at one bridgehead, and the adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups. 

In adamantanone, the carbonyl is at one position, and the adjacent carbons have two CH2 groups each. So, looking at the NMR data: 

- 4.79 (2H, possibly a singlet) → Maybe the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. But in adamantanone, the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and the adjacent carbons are each connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is for a pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But in adamantanone, the carbonyl is flanked by two CH2 groups. So, each of those CH2 groups would have protons. But wait, if they're both adjacent to the carbonyl, they might be equivalent. 

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm might be for a pair of protons on a single carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but in reality, adamantanone has a structure where the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgehead carbons. So, maybe the structure is such that the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and something else) have CH2 groups. 

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The structure of adamantanone would have a carbonyl in place of one of the bridgehead CH2 groups. So, perhaps the adjacent carbons have CH2 groups. In that case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be CH2 groups, each with two protons. 

In the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 group next to the carbonyl. But wait, in the given data, that's a singlet. If the two protons are on the same carbon and equivalent, perhaps as a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl, their coupling would be as a singlet? No, wait, they're on the same carbon, so they are equivalent and would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe they are on different carbons but in equivalent positions. Hmm. 

The other peaks are 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 region is typical for methylene or methine groups in a carbon framework, perhaps in a diamondoid structure. The 10H suggests five CH2 groups. Wait, but in adamantanone, the structure would have a certain number of CH2 and CH groups. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the NMR, but perhaps I should proceed. So, product 1 is adamantanone. Next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. 

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst. In what reactions is it used? It's commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, adamantanone is a ketone, which is an electron-deficient group. So perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, adamantanone is the acylating agent? Or maybe it's a different reaction. 

Wait, but if product 1 is adamantanone, and we're using Al(OiPr)3, then perhaps we're doing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, in that case, the acyl group would come from the acid chloride, but product 1 is a ketone, not an acid chloride. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of acylation. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is used as a catalyst for some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that usually involves metals like Na and NH3. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for a ketone to form an enol, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an enol from the ketone. But I'm not clear on that. Alternatively, maybe the aluminum is causing the ketone to undergo some kind of rearrangement. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But does adamantanone fit into that scenario? I don't think so, because adamantanone doesn't have an allyl vinyl ether structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Cope elimination or another elimination reaction. Or maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves vicinal diols. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone. Let me reevaluate. If the product after KOH is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an enone or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an enol. 

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is causing the ketone to undergo some kind of aldol condensation. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of enol formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see how. 

Wait, maybe the Al(OiPr)3 is used to form a complex with the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, leading to some kind of attack. Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum is enabling some kind of ring expansion. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the structure of adamantanone. It has a carbonyl group at a bridgehead. Upon heating with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolization or rearrangement. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bridged enol. Enols are more reactive, but I'm not sure what reaction that would lead to. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid induces a conjugate addition. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, perhaps the product after Al(OiPr)3 is a dienophile. Then, ozonolysis would break double bonds. 

Wait, moving to the next steps. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. 

Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But if the initial product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is something with a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups. 

Wait, but in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange) is in question. Deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups or in strained environments. 

Putting it all together: 

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → elimination to form a ketone (adamantanone). 

Step 2: Heating with Al(OiPr)3 → perhaps forms an enol or adds something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone. Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, adding something would form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But how? Or maybe product 2 is a dienone. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis at -78°C usually gives ozonides which, upon workup, break into carbonyl groups. 

Wait, let me think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. 

But how does product 2 get that diene? Let me go back to step 2: product 1 (adamantanone) is heated with Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in various reactions. Maybe it's used here to facilitate a ring-opening or to form a more reactive carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in a keto-enol tautomerism, making the ketone into an enol. 

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dienone. Wait, perhaps product 1 (adamantanone) is converted into a dienone via some kind of conjugate addition or elimination. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo various reactions, but I'm not sure how that would lead to product 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted adamantane with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction in step 2 is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, attaching a propenyl group or something to the adamantane. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether derived from adamantanone, but that's a stretch. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis targets double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is an alkene. 

So, how does product 1 (adamantanone) become product 2 (an alkene)? Perhaps the Lewis acid Al(OiPr)3 is used to facilitate some kind of elimination. For example, if product 1 has an alpha hydrogen, the acid could protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the alpha hydrogens more acidic, leading to elimination of water and forming a double bond. 

Wait, yes! That makes sense. If product 1 is adamantanone, which has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl), then heating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 could act as a catalyst for dehydration, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). 

So, product 2 would be an enone, like 1,3-dien-1-one or similar. Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would break it into two carbonyl groups. 

Wait, but let me think about ozonolysis of an enone. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the enone is something like:

O
||
C-R1-C=C-R2

Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. 

But in the case of adamantane, perhaps the enone is part of a ring structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to the formation of ketones or other carbonyl compounds. 

Now, considering product 3's structure, what would the NMR look like? The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl would be adjacent to some CH2 or CH groups. 

Wait, but let's think about the ozonolysis of an enone. Suppose the enone is a bridged system. When ozonolysis is performed, the double bond is cleaved, and each end forms a carbonyl group. For example, if the enone was something like:

O
||
C-CH2-C=CH2-C

After ozonolysis, it would break into two carbonyl groups. But in the case of adamantane, perhaps the double bond is in a bridge, so cleavage would open the ring, forming two carbonyls. 

Wait, but in reality, adamantane's structure is quite rigid. The enone might be part of a bridge, and ozonolysis would cleave it, leading to a structure with two ketone groups. 

So, product 3 would have two ketone groups. Then, in the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogens would be adjacent to these carbonyls. 

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange. Let's imagine that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the protons on these CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl. 

In such a case, each CH2 group would have two protons. The coupling between these protons would depend on their neighboring protons. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the protons might couple with each other and perhaps with protons on adjacent carbons. 

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, that might not be possible, but perhaps it's possible if the structure is more complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis leads to a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example:

O=C-(CH2)n-C=O

In this structure, each CH2 group is between the two carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two protons. The coupling between these protons would be as follows: each H on a CH2 would couple with the adjacent H on the same CH2 (which is equivalent, so that's a singlet within the pair), but also with any neighboring Hs from adjacent CH2 groups. 

Wait, but for a CH2 group in the middle, perhaps each H is only coupled to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 would have protons that are adjacent to another CH2. But in that case, each CH2 would be next to another CH2 on both sides. So, each proton on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other. Wait, but that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 group's protons would be coupled with the neighboring CH2 groups. Each of their protons would have neighboring protons on both sides. 

Wait, let me think about the splitting. Each proton on a CH2 group would be adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2. So, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is coupled with two Hs on the same carbon (which are equivalent, so that's a singlet within the pair), and also with two Hs on the adjacent carbon. So, each H would have coupling with two different sets: one from the same CH2 (but they're equivalent, so that doesn't split the peak) and two from the adjacent CH2. 

Wait, no. Wait, each H on a CH2 group has two neighboring Hs on the same carbon (but they're equivalent, so they don't split each other's signals). However, each H is also adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring carbon. So, each H would be split by two neighboring Hs on either side. For example, each H on the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the left and two on the right. But wait, actually, each H is coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group(s). 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure. Let's imagine a structure like this:

O=C-(CH2)3-C=O

So, each CH2 in the middle would have two neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. Each H on the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So, each H would see four neighboring Hs (wait, no, because each adjacent CH2 has two Hs). 

Wait, let's think about the middle CH2 group. Each H in the middle would be adjacent to two Hs on the left CH2 and two on the right CH2. So, each H would have coupling with four Hs. However, in reality, each H is only adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring carbons. 

But wait, each CH2 group is connected to two others. So, for a CH2 group in the middle, each H is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each of those CH2 groups has two Hs. So, each H on the middle CH2 would have coupling with four Hs in total (two on each adjacent CH2). 

Wait, but in NMR splitting, each neighboring set of Hs splits the peak. The number of splits is 2n + 1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. But wait, if the neighboring Hs are from equivalent environments, the splitting may be simplified. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between each H and the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring groups, each contributing two Hs. So, the total coupling would be to four Hs. But that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent group and two on another. 

Wait, but perhaps the structure isn't a long chain. Maybe it's a bridged structure, where each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2 group. Let's say the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O

But in a bridged system, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2. Wait, but then each CH2 group would have two neighboring Hs. So, each H on a CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. 

In that case, each H would be coupled with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. Because each H has two neighboring Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. 

Wait, let me think of an example. If a CH2 is next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. Because each adjacent H contributes two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. 

So, in product 3, if the most deshielded Hs are on CH2 groups next to carbonyls, and each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet. 

But wait, looking at the options, option A is a triplet, which would fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Let me think again. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two on each side). So, the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 2n+1=9, but that's a nonet, which isn't one of the options). So that's not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2, then each H would be coupled with two Hs, giving a triplet. 

But wait, let's think about the actual structure after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond in product 2 (the enone) would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a conjugated diene, then ozonolysis would give two carbonyls. But perhaps the double bond in product 2 is in a bridge, leading to a more complex structure. 

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone derived from adamantanone, such as a bridged enone. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond, leading to two ketone groups. 

Another possibility is that product 3 is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. So, the structure would have two ketone groups separated by a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-C=O. 

In that case, each CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent, so no splitting from them) and no other Hs beyond that. Wait, but that would be a CH2 group between two carbonyls. So, the CH2 would be O=C-CH2-C=O. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to no other Hs beyond the CH2 itself. So, each H would be a singlet. But that's not one of the options. 

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. 

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs. If the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. 

So, each H would be a triplet. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, leading to each H coupling with two Hs. 

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. 

Looking at the options, A is a triplet. So, the answer would be A. 

But wait, another angle. Perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH group, not CH2. Let's think. If ozonolysis of a cyclopropane ring opens into a carbonyl, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to two adjacent carbonyl groups with a single CH2 group in between. So, O=C-CH2-C=O. Each H on the CH2 would not have any neighboring Hs beyond the CH2 itself. So, they would be a singlet. But that's not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of a ring. For example, a five-membered ring with two ketones and a CH2 in between. Then, each H on the CH2 would have neighboring Hs on either side, perhaps from other CH2 groups. 

But this is getting too speculative. I think the most straightforward scenario is that the Hs in question are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H would then couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. 

So, the answer should be A) triplet.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, the reaction likely involves a double dehydrohalogenation. This eliminates two equivalents of HBr, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The product is identified as **adamantanone**, a ketone with a carbonyl group at a bridgehead position in the adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Heating adamantanone with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a dehydration reaction. This forms an **enone** (α,β-unsaturated ketone) by removing an α-hydrogen and forming a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product is an enone with a conjugated double bond.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of the enone at -78°C cleaves the double bond, breaking it into two carbonyl groups. This results in a **diketone** product, where the original double bond is replaced by two ketone groups. The structure of the product is a diketone with CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

4. **Analysis of the NMR Spectrum of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This coupling results in a **triplet** splitting pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

**Critical evaluation of the options:**  
- **A) Triplet**: Matches the expected coupling pattern for a hydrogen on a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Unlikely, as there is no indication of coupling with a third set of hydrogens.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Unlikely, as the splitting does not involve coupling with a second set of non-equivalent hydrogens.  
- **D) Pentagon**: Unlikely, as the splitting pattern does not involve coupling with four equivalent hydrogens.

The most consistent answer is **A) triplet**, as the splitting arises from coupling with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum. 

Hmm, let's tackle each step one by one. 

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I've heard that when vicinal dihalides (like dibromides) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions, typically E2 mechanisms. So, elimination would form an alkene. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent positions. When KOH is used in elimination, it should form an alkene. 

Wait, but wait. If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps elimination leads to a bridge structure. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the elimination would form a double bond between the two carbon atoms where the bromines were. So, the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon is part of a bridge. The 1 and 3 positions might be adjacent in such a way that elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. 

Wait, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule. Bredt's rule says that double bonds don't form at bridgehead positions in bicyclic compounds unless the ring is large enough to accommodate the strain. Adamantane has a structure that's four fused cyclohexane rings, right? So, if the elimination occurs across two bridgehead carbons, perhaps it can form a double bond. I think adamantane's structure allows for bridgehead double bonds because of its diamond-like structure. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something like that. 

The NMR data for product 1 is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but product 1 is from elimination, which should form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Oh wait, KOH could be in a different condition? Or perhaps it's not elimination but something else. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but the IR doesn't show a peak for C=C, which is usually around 1650 cm-1. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with excess KOH and high temperature, substitution is less likely because E2 is favored. 

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is that KOH could cause a cleavage of the C-Br bond. Wait, if there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so when treated with a strong base, it would eliminate to form an alkene. But earlier I thought product 1 has a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. But wait, how would that happen from a dihalide? Oh! Wait a minute, perhaps it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination is a cyclopropane or something else. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the IR data again. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. Wait, but substitution would likely require a good leaving group and perhaps a different mechanism. But KOH is a strong base, and high temperatures usually favor elimination. Hmm. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide undergoes a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a gem-diolate, which then undergoes elimination. Oh wait, perhaps it's a di-elimination. Wait, no, the product has a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. 

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH forms an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Epoxides form from dihalides via epoxidation, but that would require specific conditions, maybe like a peracid, which isn't the case here. 

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, in some cases, vicinal dihalides can undergo elimination to form ketones, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where two eliminations occur to form a carbonyl. So, each elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps two eliminations across adjacent positions would form a carbonyl. 

Wait, maybe it's a cleavage reaction. Vicinal dihalides can undergo cleavage with strong bases to form ketones or other carbonyl compounds. Oh! Yes, the cleavage of vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihaloalkanes) with strong bases can produce ketones if the starting material was a geminal dihalide. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, not geminal. Hmm. So perhaps that's not it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl via a two-step elimination. Wait, if each Br is removed, perhaps forming two H's and a double bond, but I'm stuck. 

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product 1 is not an alkene but a ketone. So, how does that happen? Maybe via a radical mechanism? I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe I should look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet. 4.79 is in the range for an -OH group, but wait, is it a singlet? Or maybe it's an -O- group. Alternatively, it could be a diastereotopic pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm might be from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH2-O. But considering the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is C=O, maybe product 1 is a ketone. 

So imagining that, perhaps product 1 is adamantanone. Adamantanone is a ketone formed by the elimination of two equivalents of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, the reaction would be: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + 2 KOH → adamantanone + 2 KBr + H2O. 

Wait, but how does that elimination happen? Each Br is removed, and two H's are abstracted, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. That makes sense. So, each Br is on adjacent carbons, and elimination of HBr twice would form a carbonyl group. 

So, product 1 is adamantanone. Then, the NMR would have a peak for the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me think about the structure of adamantanone. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused in a diamond shape. The position of the carbonyl in adamantanone is at a bridgehead. So, the structure would have the carbonyl at one bridgehead, and the adjacent carbons would have CH2 groups. 

In adamantanone, the carbonyl is at one position, and the adjacent carbons have two CH2 groups each. So, looking at the NMR data: 

- 4.79 (2H, possibly a singlet) → Maybe the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. But in adamantanone, the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and the adjacent carbons are each connected to two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is for a pair of protons on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. But in adamantanone, the carbonyl is flanked by two CH2 groups. So, each of those CH2 groups would have protons. But wait, if they're both adjacent to the carbonyl, they might be equivalent. 

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm might be for a pair of protons on a single carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but in reality, adamantanone has a structure where the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, and each bridgehead carbon is connected to two other bridgehead carbons. So, maybe the structure is such that the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and something else) have CH2 groups. 

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The structure of adamantanone would have a carbonyl in place of one of the bridgehead CH2 groups. So, perhaps the adjacent carbons have CH2 groups. In that case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be CH2 groups, each with two protons. 

In the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be the CH2 group next to the carbonyl. But wait, in the given data, that's a singlet. If the two protons are on the same carbon and equivalent, perhaps as a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl, their coupling would be as a singlet? No, wait, they're on the same carbon, so they are equivalent and would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe they are on different carbons but in equivalent positions. Hmm. 

The other peaks are 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). The 2.41-2.23 region is typical for methylene or methine groups in a carbon framework, perhaps in a diamondoid structure. The 10H suggests five CH2 groups. Wait, but in adamantanone, the structure would have a certain number of CH2 and CH groups. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the NMR, but perhaps I should proceed. So, product 1 is adamantanone. Next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. 

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst. In what reactions is it used? It's commonly used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, adamantanone is a ketone, which is an electron-deficient group. So perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, adamantanone is the acylating agent? Or maybe it's a different reaction. 

Wait, but if product 1 is adamantanone, and we're using Al(OiPr)3, then perhaps we're doing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, in that case, the acyl group would come from the acid chloride, but product 1 is a ketone, not an acid chloride. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of acylation. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is used as a catalyst for some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction, but that usually involves metals like Na and NH3. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some cycloaddition. Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for a ketone to form an enol, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an enol from the ketone. But I'm not clear on that. Alternatively, maybe the aluminum is causing the ketone to undergo some kind of rearrangement. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But does adamantanone fit into that scenario? I don't think so, because adamantanone doesn't have an allyl vinyl ether structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Cope elimination or another elimination reaction. Or maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves vicinal diols. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone. Let me reevaluate. If the product after KOH is a ketone, then perhaps product 2 is an enone or something else. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an enol. 

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is causing the ketone to undergo some kind of aldol condensation. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Then, when product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening or some kind of enol formation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see how. 

Wait, maybe the Al(OiPr)3 is used to form a complex with the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, leading to some kind of attack. Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum is enabling some kind of ring expansion. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the structure of adamantanone. It has a carbonyl group at a bridgehead. Upon heating with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolization or rearrangement. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bridged enol. Enols are more reactive, but I'm not sure what reaction that would lead to. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid induces a conjugate addition. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, perhaps the product after Al(OiPr)3 is a dienophile. Then, ozonolysis would break double bonds. 

Wait, moving to the next steps. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. 

Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But if the initial product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is something with a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups. 

Wait, but in product 3's NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange) is in question. Deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups or in strained environments. 

Putting it all together: 

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → elimination to form a ketone (adamantanone). 

Step 2: Heating with Al(OiPr)3 → perhaps forms an enol or adds something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone. Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, adding something would form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But how? Or maybe product 2 is a dienone. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a conjugated diene. Then, ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis at -78°C usually gives ozonides which, upon workup, break into carbonyl groups. 

Wait, let me think about ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. 

But how does product 2 get that diene? Let me go back to step 2: product 1 (adamantanone) is heated with Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in various reactions. Maybe it's used here to facilitate a ring-opening or to form a more reactive carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in a keto-enol tautomerism, making the ketone into an enol. 

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dienone. Wait, perhaps product 1 (adamantanone) is converted into a dienone via some kind of conjugate addition or elimination. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 2 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo various reactions, but I'm not sure how that would lead to product 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a substituted adamantane with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction in step 2 is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, attaching a propenyl group or something to the adamantane. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether derived from adamantanone, but that's a stretch. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process. Product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis targets double bonds, so product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 2 is an alkene. 

So, how does product 1 (adamantanone) become product 2 (an alkene)? Perhaps the Lewis acid Al(OiPr)3 is used to facilitate some kind of elimination. For example, if product 1 has an alpha hydrogen, the acid could protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the alpha hydrogens more acidic, leading to elimination of water and forming a double bond. 

Wait, yes! That makes sense. If product 1 is adamantanone, which has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl), then heating with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 could act as a catalyst for dehydration, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone). 

So, product 2 would be an enone, like 1,3-dien-1-one or similar. Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would break it into two carbonyl groups. 

Wait, but let me think about ozonolysis of an enone. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, for example, if the enone is something like:

O
||
C-R1-C=C-R2

Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. 

But in the case of adamantane, perhaps the enone is part of a ring structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to the formation of ketones or other carbonyl compounds. 

Now, considering product 3's structure, what would the NMR look like? The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in the ozonolysis product, each carbonyl would be adjacent to some CH2 or CH groups. 

Wait, but let's think about the ozonolysis of an enone. Suppose the enone is a bridged system. When ozonolysis is performed, the double bond is cleaved, and each end forms a carbonyl group. For example, if the enone was something like:

O
||
C-CH2-C=CH2-C

After ozonolysis, it would break into two carbonyl groups. But in the case of adamantane, perhaps the double bond is in a bridge, so cleavage would open the ring, forming two carbonyls. 

Wait, but in reality, adamantane's structure is quite rigid. The enone might be part of a bridge, and ozonolysis would cleave it, leading to a structure with two ketone groups. 

So, product 3 would have two ketone groups. Then, in the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogens would be adjacent to these carbonyls. 

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange. Let's imagine that each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the protons on these CH2 groups would be next to the carbonyl. 

In such a case, each CH2 group would have two protons. The coupling between these protons would depend on their neighboring protons. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2, the protons might couple with each other and perhaps with protons on adjacent carbons. 

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, that might not be possible, but perhaps it's possible if the structure is more complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis leads to a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. For example:

O=C-(CH2)n-C=O

In this structure, each CH2 group is between the two carbonyls. Each CH2 would have two protons. The coupling between these protons would be as follows: each H on a CH2 would couple with the adjacent H on the same CH2 (which is equivalent, so that's a singlet within the pair), but also with any neighboring Hs from adjacent CH2 groups. 

Wait, but for a CH2 group in the middle, perhaps each H is only coupled to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, each CH2 would have protons that are adjacent to another CH2. But in that case, each CH2 would be next to another CH2 on both sides. So, each proton on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other. Wait, but that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the central CH2 group's protons would be coupled with the neighboring CH2 groups. Each of their protons would have neighboring protons on both sides. 

Wait, let me think about the splitting. Each proton on a CH2 group would be adjacent to two protons on the neighboring CH2. So, each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is coupled with two Hs on the same carbon (which are equivalent, so that's a singlet within the pair), and also with two Hs on the adjacent carbon. So, each H would have coupling with two different sets: one from the same CH2 (but they're equivalent, so that doesn't split the peak) and two from the adjacent CH2. 

Wait, no. Wait, each H on a CH2 group has two neighboring Hs on the same carbon (but they're equivalent, so they don't split each other's signals). However, each H is also adjacent to two Hs on the neighboring carbon. So, each H would be split by two neighboring Hs on either side. For example, each H on the central CH2 would have two neighboring Hs on the left and two on the right. But wait, actually, each H is coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group(s). 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure. Let's imagine a structure like this:

O=C-(CH2)3-C=O

So, each CH2 in the middle would have two neighboring Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. Each H on the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So, each H would see four neighboring Hs (wait, no, because each adjacent CH2 has two Hs). 

Wait, let's think about the middle CH2 group. Each H in the middle would be adjacent to two Hs on the left CH2 and two on the right CH2. So, each H would have coupling with four Hs. However, in reality, each H is only adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring carbons. 

But wait, each CH2 group is connected to two others. So, for a CH2 group in the middle, each H is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Each of those CH2 groups has two Hs. So, each H on the middle CH2 would have coupling with four Hs in total (two on each adjacent CH2). 

Wait, but in NMR splitting, each neighboring set of Hs splits the peak. The number of splits is 2n + 1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. But wait, if the neighboring Hs are from equivalent environments, the splitting may be simplified. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between each H and the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring groups, each contributing two Hs. So, the total coupling would be to four Hs. But that's a lot. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent group and two on another. 

Wait, but perhaps the structure isn't a long chain. Maybe it's a bridged structure, where each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2 group. Let's say the structure is something like:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O

But in a bridged system, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2. Wait, but then each CH2 group would have two neighboring Hs. So, each H on a CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. 

In that case, each H would be coupled with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. Because each H has two neighboring Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. 

Wait, let me think of an example. If a CH2 is next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a triplet. Because each adjacent H contributes two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. 

So, in product 3, if the most deshielded Hs are on CH2 groups next to carbonyls, and each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be a triplet. 

But wait, looking at the options, option A is a triplet, which would fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to two other CH2 groups. Let me think again. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two on each side). So, the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 2n+1=9, but that's a nonet, which isn't one of the options). So that's not matching the options. 

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to only one other CH2, then each H would be coupled with two Hs, giving a triplet. 

But wait, let's think about the actual structure after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a double bond in product 2 (the enone) would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. If product 2 is a conjugated diene, then ozonolysis would give two carbonyls. But perhaps the double bond in product 2 is in a bridge, leading to a more complex structure. 

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enone derived from adamantanone, such as a bridged enone. Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond, leading to two ketone groups. 

Another possibility is that product 3 is a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. So, the structure would have two ketone groups separated by a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-C=O. 

In that case, each CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (which are equivalent, so no splitting from them) and no other Hs beyond that. Wait, but that would be a CH2 group between two carbonyls. So, the CH2 would be O=C-CH2-C=O. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to no other Hs beyond the CH2 itself. So, each H would be a singlet. But that's not one of the options. 

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. 

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs. If the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. 

So, each H would be a triplet. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 group, leading to each H coupling with two Hs. 

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet. 

Looking at the options, A is a triplet. So, the answer would be A. 

But wait, another angle. Perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH group, not CH2. Let's think. If ozonolysis of a cyclopropane ring opens into a carbonyl, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to two adjacent carbonyl groups with a single CH2 group in between. So, O=C-CH2-C=O. Each H on the CH2 would not have any neighboring Hs beyond the CH2 itself. So, they would be a singlet. But that's not an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 groups are part of a ring. For example, a five-membered ring with two ketones and a CH2 in between. Then, each H on the CH2 would have neighboring Hs on either side, perhaps from other CH2 groups. 

But this is getting too speculative. I think the most straightforward scenario is that the Hs in question are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. Each H would then couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. 

So, the answer should be A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, the reaction likely involves a double dehydrohalogenation. This eliminates two equivalents of HBr, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The product is identified as **adamantanone**, a ketone with a carbonyl group at a bridgehead position in the adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Heating adamantanone with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid, likely facilitates a dehydration reaction. This forms an **enone** (α,β-unsaturated ketone) by removing an α-hydrogen and forming a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product is an enone with a conjugated double bond.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of the enone at -78°C cleaves the double bond, breaking it into two carbonyl groups. This results in a **diketone** product, where the original double bond is replaced by two ketone groups. The structure of the product is a diketone with CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

4. **Analysis of the NMR Spectrum of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen on this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This coupling results in a **triplet** splitting pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

**Critical evaluation of the options:**  
- **A) Triplet**: Matches the expected coupling pattern for a hydrogen on a CH₂ group adjacent to another CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Unlikely, as there is no indication of coupling with a third set of hydrogens.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Unlikely, as the splitting does not involve coupling with a second set of non-equivalent hydrogens.  
- **D) Pentagon**: Unlikely, as the splitting pattern does not involve coupling with four equivalent hydrogens.

The most consistent answer is **A) triplet**, as the splitting arises from coupling with two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group.

Answer: A
