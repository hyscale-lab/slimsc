Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Okay, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' properties are determined by these conservation laws.

First, maybe I should figure out the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in annihilation, the rest mass energy is converted into the photons' energy, but wait, the particles are moving, so their total energy includes their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is given for both. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy of each particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

The electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. Let me write that down.

Electron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c²
Positron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c²

So total energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving towards the left, since it's coming from the right. So its velocity is opposite to the electron's. So their momenta might be in opposite directions.

Momentum for electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e
Momentum for positron: p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p

But I don't know the velocities, but maybe I can express them in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), perhaps I can find the velocities from that.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass.

Wait, for a particle moving at speed v, the momentum is gamma m v. But since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ c * 0.9682.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ c * 0.8660.

But since the positron is moving from the right towards the left (same as the electron's direction?), wait, no. The electron is moving from the left, so to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. So their velocities are opposite in direction.

Wait, no. The problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so the electron is moving to the right (positive x direction). The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's moving to the left (negative x direction). So their velocities are opposite.

So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me model this with vectors.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e (to the right, positive x direction).

The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but since it's moving to the left, p_p is negative: p_p = - gamma_p m_e v_p.

So, total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.

But wait, let's compute this.

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = (4) m_e ( (sqrt(15)/4) c ) = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Wait, that's because v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c, so p_e =4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. v_p is sqrt(3)/2 c. So p_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= m_e sqrt(3) c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, p_p is negative, so p_p = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Wait, wait no, wait. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p is negative.

Wait, no, I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me get this straight.

Electron is moving right, so positive x. Positron is moving left, so negative x. So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative.

So p_total = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

So p_total = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Wait, so let me compute the numerical value.

sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732.

So m_e sqrt(15) c ≈ 3.872 m_e c.

m_e sqrt(3) c ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

So p_total is approximately (3.872 -1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c. So positive, meaning the direction is to the right.

Hmm, but does that make sense? Because the electron has a higher gamma and a higher velocity than the positron. So the electron's momentum would be larger than the positron's, leading to a net momentum to the right.

So, the total momentum before collision is non-zero, which must be carried by the photons after annihilation.

Now, the photons are moving in opposite directions (upper-right and lower-right), but wait, no, both photons are moving to the right, but in upper and lower quadrants, meaning their directions have both x and y components. Wait, no, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both have a positive x component but y components in opposite directions.

But wait, how can that be? Because in annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved. So the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, the photons have energy E1 and E2. But the problem says the energies of both photons are the same, E1 = E2.

Because energy is conserved, the sum of the photons' energies should equal the total energy before collision. Wait, the total energy before the collision is 6 m_e c², since each contributes 4 and 2 times m_e c².

So, E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 6 m_e c². But the problem states both photons have the same energy, so each has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Because each photon's energy is E_photon = hf, but in terms of momentum, p = E/c for a photon. So, the momenta would be E/(c) each.

But wait, the problem says that both photons have the same energy, which is 3 m_e c² each.

Wait, but m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So each photon would have 3 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.533 MeV. That's a lot of energy, but okay, perhaps that's correct.

So, each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²)/c = 3 m_e c.

Wait, so photon 1 has momentum p1 = 3 m_e c in some direction, and photon 2 has p2 = 3 m_e c in another direction.

But wait, the total momentum after annihilation must equal the total before, which was p_total = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c ≈ 2.14 m_e c to the right.

Wait, but the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal that.

So, let me think in vector terms. Let me set up a coordinate system where the x-axis is along the initial direction of motion (right is positive x), and y-axis is vertical.

Photon 1 is moving upper-right, so its direction is in the first quadrant. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so its direction is in the fourth quadrant.

Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis as theta1 and theta2, respectively. One will be +theta, the other -theta, perhaps? Or maybe not, but their y-components will be opposite.

Wait, but the problem states that one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right, so perhaps one has a positive y-component and the other negative.

But both are moving to the right, so their x-components are positive.

Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.

Photon 1: p1 = (p1x, p1y)
Photon 2: p2 = (p2x, p2y)

Since they are photons, their momenta are in the direction of their movement, and |p| = E/c. So, for each, p1 = 3 m_e c, p2 =3 m_e c.

But wait, earlier calculation: each photon has energy 3 m_e c², so |p| = 3 m_e c.

So, the sum of their momenta vectors must equal the total initial momentum.

So, p_total_initial = (2.14 m_e c, 0) in the x-direction.

So, the sum of p1 and p2 must be (2.14 m_e c, 0).

So, p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.

p1y + p2y = 0.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, their y-components are opposite. Let's say p1y is positive and p2y is negative.

But let me think in terms of angles. Let me assume that the photons make angles theta and (180 - theta) with the x-axis. Wait, no, because both are moving to the right, so their angles are measured from the x-axis towards the upper and lower directions.

Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the sum of their y-components must be zero, because the initial total momentum has no y-component. So, p1y = -p2y.

Hmm. Let's model each photon's momentum vector.

Photon 1: p1x = p1 * cos(theta), p1y = p1 * sin(theta)
Photon 2: p2x = p2 * cos(phi), p2y = p2 * sin(phi)

But since both photons have same energy and same |p|, p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c.

So, p1x + p2x = (3 m_e c) (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

And p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) ) = 0.

So, from the y-component equation:

3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) = 0 → sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0 → sin(theta) = - sin(phi) → phi = -theta, or phi = 180 - theta.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If sin(theta) = - sin(phi), then phi could be -theta or 180 - theta.

But in this case, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So, their angles are on opposite sides of the x-axis. So, maybe phi is the negative of theta.

Alternatively, perhaps phi is 180 - theta, but that would place one in the second quadrant and the other in the third, which doesn't fit the description.

Wait, the problem says one is upper-right (which is first quadrant), the other is lower-right (fourth quadrant). So, the angles are theta and -theta, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one is theta above x-axis, and the other is theta below. So, phi = -theta.

In that case, sin(theta) + sin(phi) = sin(theta) + sin(-theta) = 0, which satisfies the condition.

So, let me proceed under the assumption that phi = -theta.

So, the y-components cancel, as required.

Now, the x-components must sum to 2.14 m_e c.

So, 3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

But since phi = -theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta), because cosine is even.

So, 3 m_e c (2 cos(theta) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

Simplify:

6 cos(theta) m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = 2.14 → cos(theta) = 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, approximately 69 degrees. So the two photons are each at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but the question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.

So, the angle between them would be 2 theta, because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between is 2 theta.

So, 2 * 69 degrees ≈ 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Total initial momentum in x: p_e - p_p = (4 m_e * v_e) - (2 m_e * v_p)

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in calculating the momentum. Let me re-calculate the momenta more accurately.

Because, I think I forgot that the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative.

Wait, p_e is (gamma_e * m_e * v_e) to the right.

p_p is (gamma_p * m_e * v_p) to the left. So, p_p is negative.

So, total p_initial = p_e + p_p.

Wait, let me compute each momentum.

Electron's gamma is 4, so gamma_e =4.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.9682c.

So, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Positron's gamma is 2, so gamma_p =2.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.8660 c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

So, p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p = -2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So, total momentum before collision:

p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So, p_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

So, in x-direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are emitted. Each has energy E_photon =3 m_e c².

Because the total energy before is (4 +2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is |p|= E/c =3 m_e c.

Now, the photons' momenta vectors must add up to p_initial.

So, let me denote the two photons.

Photon 1: direction at angle theta above x-axis.

Photon 2: direction at angle -theta below x-axis (since their y-components must cancel).

Thus, their momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta) )

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(-theta), 3 m_e c sin(-theta) )

Which simplifies to:

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(theta), -3 m_e c sin(theta) )

So, adding them:

Total momentum:

x-component: 3 m_e c cos(theta) + 3 m_e c cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta)
y-component: 3 m_e c sin(theta) -3 m_e c sin(theta) =0.

So, the x-component must equal the initial momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14093

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) /6 ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

Which is the same as before. So theta ≈ cos⁻¹(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Thus, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta ≈138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the correct answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. Here's the breakdown:

### Step 1: Total Energy Before Collision
The electron and positron have Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2
\]
After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon 1}} = E_{\text{photon 2}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2
\]

### Step 2: Total Momentum Before Collision
The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis in opposite directions. Their relativistic momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c = m_e \sqrt{15}c
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c = m_e \sqrt{3}c
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e \sqrt{15}c - m_e \sqrt{3}c = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]
Approximating:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_{\text{total}} \approx m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) = 2.14093m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation After Annihilation
The two photons have equal energies (\(E_{\text{photon 1}} = E_{\text{photon 2}} = 3m_e c^2\)) and equal magnitudes of momentum (\(|p_{\text{photon 1}}| = |p_{\text{photon 2}}| = 3m_e c\)). Let their directions make angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the x-axis (upper-right and lower-right, respectively). Their momentum vectors are:
\[
p_{\text{photon 1}} = (3m_e c \cos\theta, 3m_e c \sin\theta)
\]
\[
p_{\text{photon 2}} = (3m_e c \cos\theta, -3m_e c \sin\theta)
\]
The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_{\text{photon 1}} + p_{\text{photon 2}} = (6m_e c \cos\theta, 0)
\]
Equating the x-components:
\[
6m_e c \cos\theta = 2.14093m_e c \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The angle between the two photons is the angle between their directions, which is \(2\theta\):
\[
\text{Angle} = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Answer: C

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Okay, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' properties are determined by these conservation laws.

First, maybe I should figure out the total energy and momentum before the collision. Because in annihilation, the rest mass energy is converted into the photons' energy, but wait, the particles are moving, so their total energy includes their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is given for both. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the total energy of each particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

The electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. Let me write that down.

Electron's energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c²
Positron's energy: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c²

So total energy before collision is E_total = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2)m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving towards the left, since it's coming from the right. So its velocity is opposite to the electron's. So their momenta might be in opposite directions.

Momentum for electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e
Momentum for positron: p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p

But I don't know the velocities, but maybe I can express them in terms of gamma. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), perhaps I can find the velocities from that.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass.

Wait, for a particle moving at speed v, the momentum is gamma m v. But since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ c * 0.9682.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ c * 0.8660.

But since the positron is moving from the right towards the left (same as the electron's direction?), wait, no. The electron is moving from the left, so to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. So their velocities are opposite in direction.

Wait, no. The problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so the electron is moving to the right (positive x direction). The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's moving to the left (negative x direction). So their velocities are opposite.

So their momenta are in opposite directions. Let me model this with vectors.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e (to the right, positive x direction).

The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p, but since it's moving to the left, p_p is negative: p_p = - gamma_p m_e v_p.

So, total momentum before collision is p_total = p_e + p_p.

But wait, let's compute this.

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = (4) m_e ( (sqrt(15)/4) c ) = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Wait, that's because v_e = (sqrt(15)/4)c, so p_e =4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p. v_p is sqrt(3)/2 c. So p_p = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= m_e sqrt(3) c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, p_p is negative, so p_p = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Wait, wait no, wait. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so p_p is negative.

Wait, no, I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me get this straight.

Electron is moving right, so positive x. Positron is moving left, so negative x. So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's is negative.

So p_total = p_e (positive) + p_p (negative).

So p_total = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Wait, so let me compute the numerical value.

sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732.

So m_e sqrt(15) c ≈ 3.872 m_e c.

m_e sqrt(3) c ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

So p_total is approximately (3.872 -1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c. So positive, meaning the direction is to the right.

Hmm, but does that make sense? Because the electron has a higher gamma and a higher velocity than the positron. So the electron's momentum would be larger than the positron's, leading to a net momentum to the right.

So, the total momentum before collision is non-zero, which must be carried by the photons after annihilation.

Now, the photons are moving in opposite directions (upper-right and lower-right), but wait, no, both photons are moving to the right, but in upper and lower quadrants, meaning their directions have both x and y components. Wait, no, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So both have a positive x component but y components in opposite directions.

But wait, how can that be? Because in annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved. So the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, the photons have energy E1 and E2. But the problem says the energies of both photons are the same, E1 = E2.

Because energy is conserved, the sum of the photons' energies should equal the total energy before collision. Wait, the total energy before the collision is 6 m_e c², since each contributes 4 and 2 times m_e c².

So, E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 6 m_e c². But the problem states both photons have the same energy, so each has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Because each photon's energy is E_photon = hf, but in terms of momentum, p = E/c for a photon. So, the momenta would be E/(c) each.

But wait, the problem says that both photons have the same energy, which is 3 m_e c² each.

Wait, but m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So each photon would have 3 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.533 MeV. That's a lot of energy, but okay, perhaps that's correct.

So, each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²)/c = 3 m_e c.

Wait, so photon 1 has momentum p1 = 3 m_e c in some direction, and photon 2 has p2 = 3 m_e c in another direction.

But wait, the total momentum after annihilation must equal the total before, which was p_total = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c ≈ 2.14 m_e c to the right.

Wait, but the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal that.

So, let me think in vector terms. Let me set up a coordinate system where the x-axis is along the initial direction of motion (right is positive x), and y-axis is vertical.

Photon 1 is moving upper-right, so its direction is in the first quadrant. Photon 2 is moving lower-right, so its direction is in the fourth quadrant.

Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis as theta1 and theta2, respectively. One will be +theta, the other -theta, perhaps? Or maybe not, but their y-components will be opposite.

Wait, but the problem states that one photon is upper-right and the other is lower-right, so perhaps one has a positive y-component and the other negative.

But both are moving to the right, so their x-components are positive.

Let me model each photon's momentum as vectors.

Photon 1: p1 = (p1x, p1y)
Photon 2: p2 = (p2x, p2y)

Since they are photons, their momenta are in the direction of their movement, and |p| = E/c. So, for each, p1 = 3 m_e c, p2 =3 m_e c.

But wait, earlier calculation: each photon has energy 3 m_e c², so |p| = 3 m_e c.

So, the sum of their momenta vectors must equal the total initial momentum.

So, p_total_initial = (2.14 m_e c, 0) in the x-direction.

So, the sum of p1 and p2 must be (2.14 m_e c, 0).

So, p1x + p2x = 2.14 m_e c.

p1y + p2y = 0.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right, their y-components are opposite. Let's say p1y is positive and p2y is negative.

But let me think in terms of angles. Let me assume that the photons make angles theta and (180 - theta) with the x-axis. Wait, no, because both are moving to the right, so their angles are measured from the x-axis towards the upper and lower directions.

Alternatively, perhaps they are symmetric in some way.

Wait, but the sum of their y-components must be zero, because the initial total momentum has no y-component. So, p1y = -p2y.

Hmm. Let's model each photon's momentum vector.

Photon 1: p1x = p1 * cos(theta), p1y = p1 * sin(theta)
Photon 2: p2x = p2 * cos(phi), p2y = p2 * sin(phi)

But since both photons have same energy and same |p|, p1 = p2 = 3 m_e c.

So, p1x + p2x = (3 m_e c) (cos(theta) + cos(phi)) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

And p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) ) = 0.

So, from the y-component equation:

3 m_e c (sin(theta) + sin(phi)) = 0 → sin(theta) + sin(phi) = 0 → sin(theta) = - sin(phi) → phi = -theta, or phi = 180 - theta.

Wait, wait. Let me think. If sin(theta) = - sin(phi), then phi could be -theta or 180 - theta.

But in this case, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So, their angles are on opposite sides of the x-axis. So, maybe phi is the negative of theta.

Alternatively, perhaps phi is 180 - theta, but that would place one in the second quadrant and the other in the third, which doesn't fit the description.

Wait, the problem says one is upper-right (which is first quadrant), the other is lower-right (fourth quadrant). So, the angles are theta and -theta, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one is theta above x-axis, and the other is theta below. So, phi = -theta.

In that case, sin(theta) + sin(phi) = sin(theta) + sin(-theta) = 0, which satisfies the condition.

So, let me proceed under the assumption that phi = -theta.

So, the y-components cancel, as required.

Now, the x-components must sum to 2.14 m_e c.

So, 3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

But since phi = -theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta), because cosine is even.

So, 3 m_e c (2 cos(theta) ) = 2.14 m_e c.

Simplify:

6 cos(theta) m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = 2.14 → cos(theta) = 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, approximately 69 degrees. So the two photons are each at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

Wait, but the question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.

So, the angle between them would be 2 theta, because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between is 2 theta.

So, 2 * 69 degrees ≈ 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Total initial momentum in x: p_e - p_p = (4 m_e * v_e) - (2 m_e * v_p)

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in calculating the momentum. Let me re-calculate the momenta more accurately.

Because, I think I forgot that the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum is negative.

Wait, p_e is (gamma_e * m_e * v_e) to the right.

p_p is (gamma_p * m_e * v_p) to the left. So, p_p is negative.

So, total p_initial = p_e + p_p.

Wait, let me compute each momentum.

Electron's gamma is 4, so gamma_e =4.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.9682c.

So, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Positron's gamma is 2, so gamma_p =2.

v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2)^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.8660 c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative.

So, p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * v_p = -2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So, total momentum before collision:

p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So, p_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

So, in x-direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are emitted. Each has energy E_photon =3 m_e c².

Because the total energy before is (4 +2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is |p|= E/c =3 m_e c.

Now, the photons' momenta vectors must add up to p_initial.

So, let me denote the two photons.

Photon 1: direction at angle theta above x-axis.

Photon 2: direction at angle -theta below x-axis (since their y-components must cancel).

Thus, their momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta) )

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(-theta), 3 m_e c sin(-theta) )

Which simplifies to:

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(theta), -3 m_e c sin(theta) )

So, adding them:

Total momentum:

x-component: 3 m_e c cos(theta) + 3 m_e c cos(theta) =6 m_e c cos(theta)
y-component: 3 m_e c sin(theta) -3 m_e c sin(theta) =0.

So, the x-component must equal the initial momentum, which is m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14093

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) /6 ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

Which is the same as before. So theta ≈ cos⁻¹(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Thus, the angle between the two photons is 2 theta ≈138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. Here's the breakdown:

### Step 1: Total Energy Before Collision
The electron and positron have Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2
\]
After annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon 1}} = E_{\text{photon 2}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2
\]

### Step 2: Total Momentum Before Collision
The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis in opposite directions. Their relativistic momenta are:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c = m_e \sqrt{15}c
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c = m_e \sqrt{3}c
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its momentum is negative:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e \sqrt{15}c - m_e \sqrt{3}c = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
\]
Approximating:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_{\text{total}} \approx m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) = 2.14093m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation After Annihilation
The two photons have equal energies (\(E_{\text{photon 1}} = E_{\text{photon 2}} = 3m_e c^2\)) and equal magnitudes of momentum (\(|p_{\text{photon 1}}| = |p_{\text{photon 2}}| = 3m_e c\)). Let their directions make angles \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) with the x-axis (upper-right and lower-right, respectively). Their momentum vectors are:
\[
p_{\text{photon 1}} = (3m_e c \cos\theta, 3m_e c \sin\theta)
\]
\[
p_{\text{photon 2}} = (3m_e c \cos\theta, -3m_e c \sin\theta)
\]
The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_{\text{photon 1}} + p_{\text{photon 2}} = (6m_e c \cos\theta, 0)
\]
Equating the x-components:
\[
6m_e c \cos\theta = 2.14093m_e c \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The angle between the two photons is the angle between their directions, which is \(2\theta\):
\[
\text{Angle} = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
