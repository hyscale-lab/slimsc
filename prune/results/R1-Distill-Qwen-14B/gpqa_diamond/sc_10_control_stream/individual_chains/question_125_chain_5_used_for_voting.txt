Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, specifically V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, I remember that this is a harmonic oscillator potential. So the system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. 

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, right. I think I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

In the 3D case, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). Wait, no, wait. Actually, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number. Each dimension (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers. The total energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But often, it's expressed in terms of the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but when they talk about excited states, the ground state is n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), which is the lowest energy. Then the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state would have n=3. So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's part one.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. So, when the energy is fixed at E = (n + 3/2) ħω, the number of eigenfunctions corresponds to the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = n. For n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each is a non-negative integer and the sum is 3?

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to distribute 3 indistinguishable items into 3 distinguishable boxes, allowing zeros. The formula for that is (n + d -1) choose (d-1), where d is the number of dimensions. Here, d=3, so it's (3 + 3 -1) choose (3-1) )= (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, but I should be careful about the exact wording. The question says "how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue." Each distinct set (n_x, n_y, n_z) gives a distinct eigenfunction, and if they are linearly independent, then the count is correct. So 10 is the number.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10, which matches. Option C has the same energy but 3 linear functions, which doesn't make sense because we have 10. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, let me just confirm the energy. For the third excited state, n=3. So E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Yep, that's right. So option A is (9/2) hbar omega, 10 eigenfunctions. So the correct answer is A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, with $n_x, n_y, n_z$ being the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. 

For the third excited state, the total quantum number is $n = 3$ (since the ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second to $n = 2$, and the third to $n = 3$). Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ is determined by the number of ways to distribute the quantum number $n = 3$ among the three directions $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where each $n_x, n_y, n_z$ is a non-negative integer. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula for distributing $n$ indistinguishable items into $d$ distinguishable boxes:

\[
\text{Number of eigenfunctions} = \binom{n + d - 1}{d - 1}.
\]

Here, $n = 3$ and $d = 3$, so:

\[
\text{Number of eigenfunctions} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, 10.**

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, with $n_x, n_y, n_z$ being the quantum numbers in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. 

For the third excited state, the total quantum number is $n = 3$ (since the ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second to $n = 2$, and the third to $n = 3$). Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ is determined by the number of ways to distribute the quantum number $n = 3$ among the three directions $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where each $n_x, n_y, n_z$ is a non-negative integer.

\[
\text{Number of eigenfunctions} = \binom{n + d - 1}{d - 1}.
\]

Here, $n = 3$ and $d = 3$, so:

\[
\text{Number of eigenfunctions} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, 10.**
