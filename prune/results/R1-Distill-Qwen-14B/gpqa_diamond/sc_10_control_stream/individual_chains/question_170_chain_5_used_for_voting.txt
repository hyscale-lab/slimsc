Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a two-component spinor. Oh wait, probably written as a column vector [3i, 4]^T. 

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula: <A> = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is the operator. In this case, the operator is S_y, the spin in the y-direction.

Wait, spin matrices. The Pauli matrices! Right, the spin operator S for a spin-1/2 particle is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix. So S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The σ_y matrix is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

The state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, let me write that out. ψ is a column vector with components 3i and 4. The dagger (†) of ψ, which is ψ†, would be the row vector [3i, 4] with the complex conjugate of each component. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Alternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, I can compute it as (ħ/2) times ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. Multiplying the matrix σ_y by the vector ψ.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So σ_y * [3i; 4] equals:

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i
Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, the next step is to calculate ψ† multiplied by σ_y ψ. ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], right? So:

ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2. i^2 is -1, so this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding both terms gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24. Then the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, wait. Did I do that right? Because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, let me double-check the multiplication steps.

First, σ_y ψ:
Top component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. Correct.
Bottom component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = -3. Correct.

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24. That's correct.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But wait, the options are given in terms of hbar. So the answer would be -12 ħ, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25 and option B is 12 hbar/25. Hmm, wait, that doesn't match.

Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the options don't have -12 ħ as an option. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the state is (3i,4). I'm assuming that's a normalized state, but maybe it's not. Because the expectation value calculation accounts for normalization, but wait, in the calculation I did, I didn't normalize the state. Because when you have a spinor, you usually have to normalize it by dividing by its norm.

Wait a minute, the state vector is ψ = [3i,4]^T. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state would be (1/5)ψ.

Ah! Because the expectation value must be computed using the normalized state. Oh, right. I forgot that step. That's probably where I went wrong.

So let me recompute. Since the state isn't normalized, I should first normalize it.

So ψ = [3i,4]^T, norm squared is 25. So normalized ψ is (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

So the expectation value would be (1/5)^2 times the previous calculation. Because when you compute ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, if ψ is not normalized, you have to use the normalized version.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value for a non-normalized state: ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. So I didn't do that before.

So let's proceed again. The true calculation is:

⟨S_y⟩ = [ψ_normalized]† S_y [ψ_normalized]

Which is (1/5 ψ†) S_y (1/5 ψ) ) = (1/25) ψ† S_y ψ.

Earlier, I found that ψ† S_y ψ is -24 ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second—earlier, I think I messed up the scaling.

Wait, no, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the calculation is (1/25)*(ψ† σ_y ψ) * (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The expectation is (1/25) * (ψ† ( (ħ/2) σ_y ) ψ )

Which equals (ħ/2) * ( ψ† σ_y ψ ) / 25.

Earlier, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So now, it's (ħ/2) * (-24) /25.

So that's (-24 ħ) / (2*25) ) = (-12 ħ ) /25.

So the expectation value is -12 ħ /25. Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25.

So the correct answer is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula for the expectation value:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Multiplying \( \sigma_y \) by \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Now, compute:

\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
\]

- First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),
- Second term: \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).

Adding these gives:

\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the state
The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25,
\]

so the normalized state is:

\[
\psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value becomes:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25}.
\]

### Step 4: Final result
Simplify:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The correct answer is:

**A) \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \)**.

The σ_y matrix is given as:

  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

The state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, let me write that out. ψ is a column vector with components 3i and 4. The dagger (†) of ψ, which is ψ†, would be the row vector [3i, 4] with the complex conjugate of each component. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i, so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Alternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, I can compute it as (ħ/2) times ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. Multiplying the matrix σ_y by the vector ψ.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So σ_y * [3i; 4] equals:

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i
Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, the next step is to calculate ψ† multiplied by σ_y ψ. ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], right? So:

ψ† σ_y ψ = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2. i^2 is -1, so this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding both terms gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24. Then the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, wait. Did I do that right? Because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, let me double-check the multiplication steps.

First, σ_y ψ:
Top component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. Correct.
Bottom component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = -3. Correct.

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24. That's correct.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But wait, the options are given in terms of hbar. So the answer would be -12 ħ, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25 and option B is 12 hbar/25. Hmm, wait, that doesn't match.

Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because the options don't have -12 ħ as an option. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the state is (3i,4). I'm assuming that's a normalized state, but maybe it's not. Because the expectation value calculation accounts for normalization, but wait, in the calculation I did, I didn't normalize the state. Because when you have a spinor, you usually have to normalize it by dividing by its norm.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value for a non-normalized state: ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. So I didn't do that before.

So let's proceed again. The true calculation is:

⟨S_y⟩ = [ψ_normalized]† S_y [ψ_normalized]

Which is (1/5 ψ†) S_y (1/5 ψ) ) = (1/25) ψ† S_y ψ.

Earlier, I found that ψ† S_y ψ is -24 ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second—earlier, I think I messed up the scaling.

Wait, no, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the calculation is (1/25)*(ψ† σ_y ψ) * (ħ/2).

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The expectation is (1/25) * (ψ† ( (ħ/2) σ_y ) ψ )

Which equals (ħ/2) * ( ψ† σ_y ψ ) / 25.

Earlier, ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So now, it's (ħ/2) * (-24) /25.

So that's (-24 ħ) / (2*25) ) = (-12 ħ ) /25.

So the expectation value is -12 ħ /25. Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25.

So the correct answer is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula for the expectation value:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)
The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Multiplying \( \sigma_y \) by \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Now, compute:

\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
\]

- First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),
- Second term: \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).

Adding these gives:

\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the state
The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25,
\]

so the normalized state is:

\[
\psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value becomes:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25}.
\]

### Step 4: Final result
Simplify:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The correct answer is:

**A) \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \)**.
