Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water, which I remember means that the mixture has compounds with double bonds because alkenes can decolorize bromine water via addition reactions. Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids now. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so if Y doesn't decolorize bromine, that suggests that the double bonds might have been converted into something else, maybe single bonds. But since it's a result of a reaction involving Pt, I'm thinking hydrogenation here.

Wait, no, wait. The question says that when mixture X is treated with Pt when heated, it's a result of disproportionation. Oh, right! Disproportionation reactions involve a single species being both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps some molecule with unsaturation undergoes a reaction where part of it is hydrogenated and another part maybe loses hydrogen or something else.

But wait, after this treatment, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So the products don't have double bonds anymore. So perhaps the original mixture X had alkenes, and after the reaction, they become alkanes. But wait, the reaction conditions matter. If Pt is used as a catalyst, then maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction. But the problem says it's a disproportionation, so it's not just simple hydrogenation.

Wait, let me think again. The initial mixture X decolorizes bromine, so it must have double bonds. Then, upon treatment with Pt and heat, it disproportionates to give mixture Y, which doesn't have any double bonds (so Y's compounds are saturated). But why wouldn't Y decolorize bromine? Because if Y has no double bonds, then bromine wouldn't react. So that makes sense.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's part of Y. Also, Z is widely used as a solvent, like maybe hexane or something similar. But wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given, so let's calculate that.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So if the compound is CH2 something, maybe. Let's see. For a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH2m. The mass of H is 14.28% of the molecular weight. Let's compute. Suppose the formula is CnHm. No, wait, wait. Wait, the mass fraction is (mass of H) / (total mass) = 14.28% = 1/7.

So,

mass of H = (1/7)*M, where M is the molecular weight.

Each H contributes 1, so total H atoms = m (if formula is CnHm).

But wait, the mass of H is m * 1 g/mol.

So,

(m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, that's the formula for an alkene. But wait, in the problem, when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z, which doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be an alkane. Because if it's an alkene, hydrogenation would add more H2. But Z doesn't react further, so it can't have any double bonds.

Wait, but earlier, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which implies Y has no double bonds. So Z must be a fully saturated compound.

Wait, but then according to the calculation, the formula is CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is CnH2m. Let's recalculate.

Let me think again.

The mass fraction is 14.28% = 1/7.

The molecular formula is CnHmO? No, wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, so no O.

So, molecular formula is CnHm.

Mass of H is (m *1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m =12n +m →6m=12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n. Hmm, but that's an alkene. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it's an alkane. Unless, perhaps, I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane? Like cyclohexane, which is C6H12, so n=6, m=12. So for cyclohexane, m=12, n=6 → m=2n. That fits.

So Z is a cycloalkane, which is a fully saturated compound. Because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds, so it's an alkane in terms of hydrogenation.

So, if Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

Wait, but the problem says that when both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give only Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce Z. So let's think about that.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two products from the disproportionation of those alkenes.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, something like ethylene and another, but upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo a reaction (disproportionation) to form Y.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial mixture X has an alkene that undergoes a [1,2] shift or some kind of isomerization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mixture X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon heating with Pt, it undergoes a reaction that converts some of it into a diol or something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the problem says that mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. So each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation to form two components in Y.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing hydrogenation, but with some kind of disproportionation.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of an alkene and another compound. Let me try to think about a specific example.

Wait, another approach: if Z is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So X must be something that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but hydrogenation would add hydrogen. So for example, if X is cyclohexene (C6H10), hydrogenation would give C6H12. But wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So the two components in X would each hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, but Z is a single product. So both components in X would hydrogenate to the same Z.

Hmm, that suggests that X could be a mixture of two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same alkane, Z.

But that's a bit tricky because different alkenes would generally hydrogenate to different alkanes. Unless they are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. For example, if X was a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene, but that doesn't make sense because upon hydrogenation, they both give pentane, which would be the same. But wait, maybe that's the case.

Wait, but let me check. Suppose X is a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene. Each would hydrogenate to pentane. So then, hydrogenation of X would give pure pentane. But the question says that hydrogenation of both X and Y give Z. So if X is a mixture of different alkenes, both would hydrogenate to Z.

So Z is pentane, which is C5H12. Let's compute the hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen in pentane: 12 C = 12*5=60, H=12*1=12. Total mass is 60+12=72 g/mol. Hydrogen mass fraction is (12/72) = 16.666...%, which is 1/6, not 14.28%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe Z is hexane. Let's compute its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hexane is C6H14. Molecular weight: 6*12 +14 = 72+14=86.

Hydrogen mass is 14 g. So 14/86 = approx 16.279%, again higher than 14.28%. Not matching.

Wait, earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. Molecular weight is 6*12 +12=72 +12=84. Hydrogen mass is 12 g. 12/84 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that matches. So Z is cyclohexane.

So, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which hydrogenates to cyclohexane. That suggests that the alkenes in X are cyclohexene or another cyclohexene isomer? Or perhaps another structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So if X has cyclohexene, then X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a cyclic alkene. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. So maybe the other component in X is a different structure, like 1,3-cyclohexadiene or something else. Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each would have to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps both are alkenes that are structurally different but hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, perhaps the other component is an alkene which, upon hydrogenation, also becomes cyclohexane. For example, if the other component is 1-cyclohexene, but that's the same as cyclohexene.

Alternatively, maybe the other component is a different di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are each cyclic but differ in substitution. For example, maybe 1,2-dichloroethene or something else? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think about Y. Y is formed by the disproportionation of X, which was treated with Pt and heat. Disproportionation of alkenes? Hmm, what reactions can alkenes undergo with Pt?

Wait, another angle: the reaction in which X is treated with Pt and heated is a disproportionation reaction leading to Y. The result is that Y does not decolorize bromine, meaning no double bonds. So Y must have all single bonds.

But what kind of reaction would cause that? Maybe hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation would add H2 to double bonds, converting alkenes to alkanes. But hydrogenation is not a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. For example, some kind of isomerization, but that doesn't change the functional groups. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but that's not a standard term. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or ring-closing reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture X has cyclic dienes, and upon treatment with Pt, they undergo some kind of reaction that breaks the double bonds but in a way that creates a new structure. Maybe it's a hydrogenation but in a way that leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial X is a conjugated diene, and upon treatment with Pt, it undergoes some kind of hydrogen shift or addition that breaks the conjugation.

Wait, but the problem states that X does not have any conjugated multiple bonds. So that's not the case. So X's alkenes are non-conjugated.

Hmm, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each undergoing a different reaction when treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y. But since it's a disproportionation, perhaps each alkene in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction, producing two different products.

Wait, so let's think of a specific example. Let's say one of the alkenes in X is propene (propylene). But wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Upon hydrogenation, it would become propane. But wait, that would just be a single product. But the problem says that X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two other liquids. So each alkene in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction to form two products in Y.

Wait, but how does a single alkene undergo a disproportionation? Another approach: perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing a hydrogen shift, like in some isomerization. Or perhaps they are undergoing a reaction where a part is hydrogenated and another part is dehydrogenated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where one is hydrogenated (adding H2) and another is dehydrogenated (losing H2, forming a triple bond or a more substituted double bond). But that would require specific conditions.

Wait, but the problem states that the treatment is with Pt and heat, which usually is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So maybe the reaction is hydrogenation, but the result is a mixture Y which doesn't have any double bonds. So X must have alkenes, Y has alkanes. But that would mean that X is a mixture of alkenes, Y is a mixture of alkanes, and when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give only Z, which is an alkane. Wait, but if Y is already alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So if Y is alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't change them. So Z must be the same as Y's components. But the problem says that Y is a mixture of two liquids, which don't decolorize bromine, so they're alkanes.

Wait, but then why does hydrogenation of X and Y give Z? Because if X is alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes (Y), but according to the problem, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says:

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.

So, when X (mixture of two alkenes) is hydrogenated, it produces Z, which is an alkane.

Similarly, when Y (mixture of two other liquids, which are alkanes) is hydrogenated, it also produces Z. But wait, if Y is already alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that can't be. So perhaps Y isn't alkanes.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. So Y must have single bonds, i.e., alkanes or maybe some other structure without double bonds, like aromatic rings but those are conjugated.

Wait, but the problem says that X has no conjugated double bonds. So Y, which comes from X's reaction, would have no double bonds, so it's alkanes. But if Y is alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y would give nothing. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe Z is a different product from Y. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: Let's think about Z first. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So as calculated earlier, that gives a formula for Z as CnH2n. But that's an alkene. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be an alkane.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe Z is a cycloalkane, which is a saturated compound. Then, the formula would be CnH2n. Wait, but cycloalkanes have the same general formula as alkenes. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate. Let me set up the equation again.

Mass percent H = (mass of H in Z) / (molar mass of Z) × 100% = 14.28%.

Assuming Z is CnH2m.

Wait, earlier I assumed m = 2n, but let's do it correctly.

Z is a hydrocarbon, so formula is CnHm.

Molar mass Z is 12n + m.

Hydrogen contributes m grams per mole. So,

(m / (12n + m)) × 100% = 14.28% → m/(12n + m) ) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.714n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.714n → 0.8572m = 1.714n → m = (1.714 / 0.8572) n → m ≈ 2n.

So, approximately 2n = m.

So formula is CnH2n. Which is an alkene or cycloalkane. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, which adds H2.

So, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, which would mean that X and Y are alkenes that upon hydrogenation give the cycloalkane Z.

Wait, but cycloalkanes are not alkenes. So if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes. But if Z is a cycloalkane, that would mean that X's alkenes, upon hydrogenation, form a ring structure. Which would require specific conditions, perhaps catalytic hydrogenation under certain pressures and temperatures. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a bicyclic compound, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle. Let's suppose that Z is cyclohexane, C6H12. So,

Hydrogen mass fraction is (12)/(72 +12) )= 12/84 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that matches.

So Z is cyclohexane.

Now, when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclohexane. So X must be cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

But X is a mixture of two alkenes. So, perhaps one of them is cyclohexene and the other is another alkene that upon hydrogenation also gives cyclohexane. But that seems unlikely because different alkenes would hydrogenate to different alkanes.

Wait, unless the other component is a different ring structure, like cyclopentene, but that would give cyclopentane upon hydrogenation, which is a different compound than cyclohexane.

So perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same cycloalkane. That seems a bit tricky, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a cyclic and a non-cyclic alkene that both hydrogenate to the same product. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are structurally such that their hydrogenation gives the same product. For example, suppose X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But then, hydrogenation of a diene would typically give an alkane with two more H's. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other component in X is a substituted cyclohexene. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let me think about the reaction that produces Y. Since Y is formed by the disproportionation of X with Pt and heat, perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where one is hydrogenated (add H2) and another is dehydrogenated (lose H2, become something else).

Wait, but alkenes don't generally lose H2 to become something else. Unless it's a different kind of reaction, like isomerization or something else.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a hydrogenolysis or cleavage reaction. For example, some alkenes can be cleaved with H2 and a catalyst to form smaller alkenes or alkanes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else, but that would require halogens, which aren't mentioned here.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible options for mixture X and Y.

Given that Z is cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, perhaps X is a mixture of alkyne and another compound. Wait, but X decolorizes bromine water, which would happen with triple bonds as well. But the problem says X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so maybe it's a mono-alkene and a mono-alkyne? No, but the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, but that doesn't rule out isolated double bonds or triple bonds. Wait, but the problem says "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So each molecule in X can have multiple bonds, but they are not conjugated. So for instance, one compound could have a double bond and another a triple bond, but not in conjugation.

Wait, but then, hydrogenation of such would give different products. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. But that would require that X's alkenes are sources of cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For example, perhaps X is 1-cyclopentene and cyclohexene. Wait, but that's not correct because 1-cyclopentene would hydrogenate to cyclopentane, not cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the possibilities for X and Y.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two products from their disproportionation, which doesn't have any double bonds. So Y has two alkanes. Then, the hydrogenation of X (alkenes) gives alkanes (Y), and the hydrogenation of Y (alkanes) gives nothing, but according to the problem, gives Z. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y isn't an alkane. Maybe Y is an alkane and another compound without double bonds, but not an alkane. Like an aromatic compound? No, because then it would have conjugated double bonds and decolorize bromine, but Y doesn't.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a dihydrogenation, but I don't think that term is correct. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration or some addition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. But then, when treated with Pt and H2, they might hydrogenate differently. For example, an alkyne would hydrogenate to an alkene with Pt, but wait, if it's a dihydrogenation, it becomes an alkane. Hmm, not sure.

But wait, the question says that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction. That usually implies that the same element or compound is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps one component in X is being hydrogenated (reduction) and another is being dehydrogenated (oxidation). But that's confusing because alkenes don't typically lose H2.

Wait, perhaps it's a [1,3] shift or some isomerization. I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should focus on the part where we need to find the number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Wait, the question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So, perhaps we can find the molecular formulas of the two liquids in X and add up the H atoms.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then when X is hydrogenated, each component in X must add H2 to become cyclohexane. Wait, but that would mean that each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene (C6H10) upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but that's only possible if the other alkene also becomes cyclohexane. For example, if the other component is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is C6H8. Hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, giving C6H12, which is cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then upon hydrogenation, both would give cyclohexane (C6H12).

So each component in X is a cyclic diene or mono-ene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

But wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids. So if they're both alkenes, perhaps each is a different cyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a different mono-alkene that upon hydrogenation gives the same cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem possible because different alkenes would give different alkanes upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexene and another structure, maybe a non-cyclic alkene, but that's unlikely. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. For example, if one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is a different structure that upon hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane. But I can't think of a non-cyclic alkene that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components in X are the same but different isomers. For example, maybe two different diastereomers of an alkene, but that wouldn't change the product upon hydrogenation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the number of hydrogen atoms in X's components.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12), then the alkenes must have two fewer hydrogens each than cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's not correct because cyclohexene is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So cyclohexene has 10 H's, and cyclohexane has 12. So the alkenes in X must have 10 H's each. Therefore, each component in X has 10 H's. So if X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each with C6H10, then each has 10 H's. So total in X would be 20 H's. But the options don't have 20 as an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two alkenes in X are different. For example, one is C6H10 and the other is C5H10. But wait, if the other is C5H10, hydrogenation would give C5H12, which is pentane, not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem states that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, both must hydrogenate to Z. So Z must be the same as the hydrogenation product of both. So both alkenes in X must hydrogenate to the same Z.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of two substituted cyclohexenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexene. But upon hydrogenation, both would give the same product, 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane, which are different. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the two alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation gives the same product. For example, if one is a mono-ene and another is a di-ene, but both upon hydrogenation give the same product.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the initial mixture X. X is two alkenes, each with a certain number of H's. The total H's in X would be the sum of H's in both.

So, if each component in X has n H's, the total is 2n.

But what's the possible n?

Wait, Z is C6H12. So each component in X upon hydrogenation adds 2 H's per double bond. So, if X's component has a double bond, then during hydrogenation, the alkene (CnH2m) becomes an alkane (CnH2m+2). So, for Z to be C6H12, the alkene in X must have been C6H10. Because H10 + 2 = H12.

So, each component in X is C6H10. Therefore, each has 10 H's. So two components would have 20 H's in total. But the options don't have 20. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Hmm, perhaps the two alkenes in X are C5H10 and C7H14. Wait, no, that can't be because C7H14 is an alkane, not an alkene. Wait, no, C7H14 for alkenes would be incorrect because alkenes have two fewer H's than alkanes. For C7, alkane would be C7H16, so alkene would be C7H14. So X could be a mixture of C5H10 and C7H14. But when hydrogenated, they would become pentane (C5H12) and heptane (C7H16). But then, hydrogenation of X would give two products, not a single Z. So that contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the mixture X is a mixture of different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives the same Z. For that, perhaps the alkenes are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. But that's only possible if they are the same molecule in different configurations, which wouldn't be two separate components.

Wait, but perhaps X contains two different mono-alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same product. For example, if X is a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene, but both would hydrogenate to pentane, which is the same. But then, the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids, but 1-pentene and 2-pentene are both liquids? I'm not sure about their physical states, but perhaps.

In that case, each component in X is C5H10 (a mono-alkene), so each has 10 H's. So two components would have 20 H's. But 20 isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps X isn't C5H10 but another structure. Let me think about Z again. Z is C6H12, which is cyclohexane. So, if X's alkenes upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane, then each X component must have been C6H10 (cyclohexene), which would have 10 H's. So each component in X has 10 H's, two components would have 20 H's in total. But the options don't include 20.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the initial alkenes in X are not cyclohexene but something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about possible H counts. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

If the total H in X is 18, that would imply that each component has 9 H's. So, if each component in X is a C4H8 alkene (which is an alkene), because 4 carbons would mean an alkene has 8 H's (since formula for alkene is CnH2n-2. So for n=4, H=6? Wait, no. Wait, for n=4, the alkene would be C4H8 (since 2n=8). So H=8.

Wait, so if X is a mixture of two C4H8 alkenes, each has 8 H's. So two would give 16 H's. But 16 is option A, but the options are 16, 18, etc.

Alternatively, maybe each component is C5H10, which has 10 H's. Two would sum to 20, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X have varying H counts. For example, one is C4H8 (8 H's) and the other is C5H10 (10 H's), giving a total of 18 H's. So the total would be 8 +10 =18, which is option B.

But then, upon hydrogenation, each would become C4H10 and C5H12, which are different alkanes. So the hydrogenation of X would give two products, which contradicts the problem statement that says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes with the same number of H's. For example, each is C5H10, so 10 H's each, totaling 20. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about cyclohexane. Let me re-examine the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: What if Z is not cyclohexane but something else?

If Z is C4H10, which is butane. Let's compute its H mass fraction.

Butane: 4*12 +10 =58 g/mol. H mass is 10 g. 10/58 ≈17.24%, which isn't 14.28%.

If Z is C7H16: H mass is 16, total mass 7*12+16= 92+16=108. 16/108≈14.81%, which is about 14.28% but not exact.

Wait, 14.28% is exactly 1/7. Let's see which compound gives exactly 1/7.

Earlier, for Z being C6H12 (cyclohexane), 12 H's, molecular weight 84. 12/84=1/7. So that fits.

So Z must be C6H12, cyclohexane.

So X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So each component in X must be C6H10.

But earlier that gives a total H of 20, which isn't an option.

Wait, unless X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with 8 H's. Then 8 *2=16 H's, which is option A.

But then, alkenes with 8 H's would be C5H10 (since 2n=10 for n=5), which upon hydrogenation would give C5H12, not cyclohexane.

Wait, this is getting frustrating.

Alternative approach: Since the problem gives the options, perhaps I can work backward.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assume that the correct answer is 18. That would mean that the two alkenes in X have a total of 18 H's. So each has 9 H's. But how can an alkene have 9 H's?

Wait, for an alkene, the formula is CnH2n-2. So, if an alkene has m H's, then m=2n-2.

If m=9, then 2n-2=9 → 2n=11 → n=5.5, which isn't possible because n must be integer.

So 9 H's isn't possible for an alkene. So 18 total H's would require each component to have 9 H's, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps the alkenes have 8 and 10 H's. 8+10=18. So option B is 18.

So each component would be C4H8 and C5H10.

But then, when X is hydrogenated, C4H8 would become C4H10, and C5H10 would become C5H12. So Y would be a mixture of C4H10 and C5H12. But according to the problem, hydrogenation of Y would give Z, which is cyclohexane.

But C4H10 upon hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions wouldn't change because it's an alkane. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of C3H6 and C5H10. Each has 6 and 10 H's, so total 16, which is option A.

But then, hydrogenation of X would give C3H8 and C5H12, which are alkanes. Then, hydrogenation of Y (the same as X's products) would give nothing, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are not simple mono-alkenes but are more complex, like tri-substituted or something else.

Another thought: What if X is a mixture of cyclopropane and another compound? No, cyclopropane is an alkane (no double bonds), so X wouldn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think again about the possible structures.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with the same number of H's, such that their total is one of the options.

For example, if each is C5H10, which has 10 H's, then two would have 20 H's. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each is C4H8, which has 8 H's, so two give 16 H's, option A.

But then, hydrogenation would give C4H10, which is butane, and that wouldn't match Z being cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the hydrogenation of Y. If Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't change them, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So maybe Y isn't alkanes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Y is a mixture of alkenes as well, but without conjugated double bonds. But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so no double bonds. So Y must be alkanes.

So, to recap, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each upon hydrogenation gives Z (cyclohexane). So each component in X must be C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So each component has 10 H's. Two components would have 20 H's. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating Z's formula. Let me recheck.

If Z is C6H12, H mass is 12. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=72+12=84. 12/84=1/7, which is correct.

So, each component in X is C6H10. So 10 H's each. Two components: 20 H's. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the alkenes in X are not monocyclic. Maybe they're different. For example, perhaps one is a mono-alkene (C6H10) and the other is a di-alkene (C6H8). So each would hydrogenate to C6H12. So X is a mixture of C6H10 and C6H8.

Each component would have 10 and 8 H's, respectively. So total H's in X would be 18, which is option B.

Ah! That makes sense. Because each would hydrogenate to C6H12. So if X is a mixture of C6H10 (10 H's) and C6H8 (8 H's), then upon hydrogenation, each would add H2 to become C6H12. Thus, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclohexane.

So the total number of H's in X would be 10 +8=18, which is option B.

So the answer should be 18 H's in X.

The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, given the following conditions:

1. **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes (non-conjugated double bonds). Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y contains no double bonds.

2. **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. Y does not decolorize bromine water, confirming it is saturated (alkanes).

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both mixtures, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, yield a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%, which corresponds to a molecular formula of **C₆H₁₂** (cyclohexane). Z is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen.

4. **Key Deductions**:
   - Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), as it matches the mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) and is a saturated hydrocarbon.
   - X must be a mixture of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, yield Z. Therefore, the components of X are alkenes with the formula **C₆H₁₀** (monocyclic) and **C₆H₈** (bicyclic), which hydrogenate to **C₆H₁₂**.
   - Each component in X contributes a specific number of hydrogen atoms: **C₆H₁₀** contributes 10 hydrogens, and **C₆H₈** contributes 8 hydrogens.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is the sum of the hydrogens in both components:
     \[
     \text{Total H atoms} = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water, which I remember means that the mixture has compounds with double bonds because alkenes can decolorize bromine water via addition reactions. Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids now. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so if Y doesn't decolorize bromine, that suggests that the double bonds might have been converted into something else, maybe single bonds. But since it's a result of a reaction involving Pt, I'm thinking hydrogenation here.

Wait, no, wait. The question says that when mixture X is treated with Pt when heated, it's a result of disproportionation. Oh, right! Disproportionation reactions involve a single species being both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps some molecule with unsaturation undergoes a reaction where part of it is hydrogenated and another part maybe loses hydrogen or something else.

But wait, after this treatment, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So the products don't have double bonds anymore. So perhaps the original mixture X had alkenes, and after the reaction, they become alkanes. But wait, the reaction conditions matter. If Pt is used as a catalyst, then maybe it's a hydrogenation reaction. But the problem says it's a disproportionation, so it's not just simple hydrogenation.

Wait, let me think again. The initial mixture X decolorizes bromine, so it must have double bonds. Then, upon treatment with Pt and heat, it disproportionates to give mixture Y, which doesn't have any double bonds (so Y's compounds are saturated). But why wouldn't Y decolorize bromine? Because if Y has no double bonds, then bromine wouldn't react. So that makes sense.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's part of Y. Also, Z is widely used as a solvent, like maybe hexane or something similar. But wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given, so let's calculate that.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So if the compound is CH2 something, maybe. Let's see. For a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnH2m. The mass of H is 14.28% of the molecular weight. Let's compute. Suppose the formula is CnHm. No, wait, wait. Wait, the mass fraction is (mass of H) / (total mass) = 14.28% = 1/7.

So,

mass of H = (1/7)*M, where M is the molecular weight.

Each H contributes 1, so total H atoms = m (if formula is CnHm).

But wait, the mass of H is m * 1 g/mol.

So,

(m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n.

Wait, that's the formula for an alkene. But wait, in the problem, when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z, which doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be an alkane. Because if it's an alkene, hydrogenation would add more H2. But Z doesn't react further, so it can't have any double bonds.

Wait, but earlier, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which implies Y has no double bonds. So Z must be a fully saturated compound.

Wait, but then according to the calculation, the formula is CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is CnH2m. Let's recalculate.

Let me think again.

The mass fraction is 14.28% = 1/7.

The molecular formula is CnHmO? No, wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, so no O.

So, molecular formula is CnHm.

Mass of H is (m *1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = (12n + m)/7 → 7m =12n +m →6m=12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n. Hmm, but that's an alkene. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it's an alkane. Unless, perhaps, I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane? Like cyclohexane, which is C6H12, so n=6, m=12. So for cyclohexane, m=12, n=6 → m=2n. That fits.

So Z is a cycloalkane, which is a fully saturated compound. Because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds, so it's an alkane in terms of hydrogenation.

So, if Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

Wait, but the problem says that when both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give only Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce Z. So let's think about that.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two products from the disproportionation of those alkenes.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, something like ethylene and another, but upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo a reaction (disproportionation) to form Y.

Wait, another thought: maybe the initial mixture X has an alkene that undergoes a [1,2] shift or some kind of isomerization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mixture X is a di-substituted alkene, and upon heating with Pt, it undergoes a reaction that converts some of it into a diol or something else. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the problem says that mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. So each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation to form two components in Y.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing hydrogenation, but with some kind of disproportionation.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of an alkene and another compound. Let me try to think about a specific example.

Wait, another approach: if Z is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So X must be something that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but hydrogenation would add hydrogen. So for example, if X is cyclohexene (C6H10), hydrogenation would give C6H12. But wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So the two components in X would each hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, but Z is a single product. So both components in X would hydrogenate to the same Z.

Hmm, that suggests that X could be a mixture of two different alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same alkane, Z.

But that's a bit tricky because different alkenes would generally hydrogenate to different alkanes. Unless they are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. For example, if X was a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene, but that doesn't make sense because upon hydrogenation, they both give pentane, which would be the same. But wait, maybe that's the case.

Wait, but let me check. Suppose X is a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene. Each would hydrogenate to pentane. So then, hydrogenation of X would give pure pentane. But the question says that hydrogenation of both X and Y give Z. So if X is a mixture of different alkenes, both would hydrogenate to Z.

So Z is pentane, which is C5H12. Let's compute the hydrogen mass fraction.

Hydrogen in pentane: 12 C = 12*5=60, H=12*1=12. Total mass is 60+12=72 g/mol. Hydrogen mass fraction is (12/72) = 16.666...%, which is 1/6, not 14.28%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe Z is hexane. Let's compute its hydrogen mass fraction.

Hexane is C6H14. Molecular weight: 6*12 +14 = 72+14=86.

Hydrogen mass is 14 g. So 14/86 = approx 16.279%, again higher than 14.28%. Not matching.

Wait, earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. Molecular weight is 6*12 +12=72 +12=84. Hydrogen mass is 12 g. 12/84 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that matches. So Z is cyclohexane.

So, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give cyclohexane.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which hydrogenates to cyclohexane. That suggests that the alkenes in X are cyclohexene or another cyclohexene isomer? Or perhaps another structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So if X has cyclohexene, then X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a cyclic alkene. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. So maybe the other component in X is a different structure, like 1,3-cyclohexadiene or something else. Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each would have to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps both are alkenes that are structurally different but hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, perhaps the other component is an alkene which, upon hydrogenation, also becomes cyclohexane. For example, if the other component is 1-cyclohexene, but that's the same as cyclohexene.

Alternatively, maybe the other component is a different di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are each cyclic but differ in substitution. For example, maybe 1,2-dichloroethene or something else? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think about Y. Y is formed by the disproportionation of X, which was treated with Pt and heat. Disproportionation of alkenes? Hmm, what reactions can alkenes undergo with Pt?

Wait, another angle: the reaction in which X is treated with Pt and heated is a disproportionation reaction leading to Y. The result is that Y does not decolorize bromine, meaning no double bonds. So Y must have all single bonds.

But what kind of reaction would cause that? Maybe hydrogenation? Because hydrogenation would add H2 to double bonds, converting alkenes to alkanes. But hydrogenation is not a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. For example, some kind of isomerization, but that doesn't change the functional groups. Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but that's not a standard term. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or ring-closing reaction.

Wait, perhaps the initial mixture X has cyclic dienes, and upon treatment with Pt, they undergo some kind of reaction that breaks the double bonds but in a way that creates a new structure. Maybe it's a hydrogenation but in a way that leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial X is a conjugated diene, and upon treatment with Pt, it undergoes some kind of hydrogen shift or addition that breaks the conjugation.

Wait, but the problem states that X does not have any conjugated multiple bonds. So that's not the case. So X's alkenes are non-conjugated.

Hmm, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each undergoing a different reaction when treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y. But since it's a disproportionation, perhaps each alkene in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction, producing two different products.

Wait, so let's think of a specific example. Let's say one of the alkenes in X is propene (propylene). But wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Upon hydrogenation, it would become propane. But wait, that would just be a single product. But the problem says that X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two other liquids. So each alkene in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction to form two products in Y.

Wait, but how does a single alkene undergo a disproportionation? Another approach: perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing a hydrogen shift, like in some isomerization. Or perhaps they are undergoing a reaction where a part is hydrogenated and another part is dehydrogenated.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where one is hydrogenated (adding H2) and another is dehydrogenated (losing H2, forming a triple bond or a more substituted double bond). But that would require specific conditions.

Wait, but the problem states that the treatment is with Pt and heat, which usually is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So maybe the reaction is hydrogenation, but the result is a mixture Y which doesn't have any double bonds. So X must have alkenes, Y has alkanes. But that would mean that X is a mixture of alkenes, Y is a mixture of alkanes, and when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give only Z, which is an alkane. Wait, but if Y is already alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So if Y is alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't change them. So Z must be the same as Y's components. But the problem says that Y is a mixture of two liquids, which don't decolorize bromine, so they're alkanes.

Wait, but then why does hydrogenation of X and Y give Z? Because if X is alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes (Y), but according to the problem, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says:

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z.

So, when X (mixture of two alkenes) is hydrogenated, it produces Z, which is an alkane.

Similarly, when Y (mixture of two other liquids, which are alkanes) is hydrogenated, it also produces Z. But wait, if Y is already alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that can't be. So perhaps Y isn't alkanes.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. So Y must have single bonds, i.e., alkanes or maybe some other structure without double bonds, like aromatic rings but those are conjugated.

Wait, but the problem says that X has no conjugated double bonds. So Y, which comes from X's reaction, would have no double bonds, so it's alkanes. But if Y is alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y would give nothing. So that suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe Z is a different product from Y. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: Let's think about Z first. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So as calculated earlier, that gives a formula for Z as CnH2n. But that's an alkene. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be an alkane.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe Z is a cycloalkane, which is a saturated compound. Then, the formula would be CnH2n. Wait, but cycloalkanes have the same general formula as alkenes. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate. Let me set up the equation again.

Mass percent H = (mass of H in Z) / (molar mass of Z) × 100% = 14.28%.

Assuming Z is CnH2m.

Wait, earlier I assumed m = 2n, but let's do it correctly.

Z is a hydrocarbon, so formula is CnHm.

Molar mass Z is 12n + m.

Hydrogen contributes m grams per mole. So,

(m / (12n + m)) × 100% = 14.28% → m/(12n + m) ) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.714n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.714n → 0.8572m = 1.714n → m = (1.714 / 0.8572) n → m ≈ 2n.

So, approximately 2n = m.

So formula is CnH2n. Which is an alkene or cycloalkane. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, which adds H2.

So, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, which would mean that X and Y are alkenes that upon hydrogenation give the cycloalkane Z.

Wait, but cycloalkanes are not alkenes. So if X is a mixture of alkenes, hydrogenation would give alkanes. But if Z is a cycloalkane, that would mean that X's alkenes, upon hydrogenation, form a ring structure. Which would require specific conditions, perhaps catalytic hydrogenation under certain pressures and temperatures. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a bicyclic compound, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle. Let's suppose that Z is cyclohexane, C6H12. So,

Hydrogen mass fraction is (12)/(72 +12) )= 12/84 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. Yes, that matches.

So Z is cyclohexane.

Now, when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclohexane. So X must be cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

But X is a mixture of two alkenes. So, perhaps one of them is cyclohexene and the other is another alkene that upon hydrogenation also gives cyclohexane. But that seems unlikely because different alkenes would hydrogenate to different alkanes.

Wait, unless the other component is a different ring structure, like cyclopentene, but that would give cyclopentane upon hydrogenation, which is a different compound than cyclohexane.

So perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that both hydrogenate to the same cycloalkane. That seems a bit tricky, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a cyclic and a non-cyclic alkene that both hydrogenate to the same product. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that are structurally such that their hydrogenation gives the same product. For example, suppose X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene. But then, hydrogenation of a diene would typically give an alkane with two more H's. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other component in X is a substituted cyclohexene. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let me think about the reaction that produces Y. Since Y is formed by the disproportionation of X with Pt and heat, perhaps the alkenes in X are undergoing a reaction where one is hydrogenated (add H2) and another is dehydrogenated (lose H2, become something else).

Wait, but alkenes don't generally lose H2 to become something else. Unless it's a different kind of reaction, like isomerization or something else.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a hydrogenolysis or cleavage reaction. For example, some alkenes can be cleaved with H2 and a catalyst to form smaller alkenes or alkanes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or something else, but that would require halogens, which aren't mentioned here.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible options for mixture X and Y.

Given that Z is cyclohexane, and hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, perhaps X is a mixture of alkyne and another compound. Wait, but X decolorizes bromine water, which would happen with triple bonds as well. But the problem says X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so maybe it's a mono-alkene and a mono-alkyne? No, but the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, but that doesn't rule out isolated double bonds or triple bonds. Wait, but the problem says "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So each molecule in X can have multiple bonds, but they are not conjugated. So for instance, one compound could have a double bond and another a triple bond, but not in conjugation.

Wait, but then, hydrogenation of such would give different products. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. But that would require that X's alkenes are sources of cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For example, perhaps X is 1-cyclopentene and cyclohexene. Wait, but that's not correct because 1-cyclopentene would hydrogenate to cyclopentane, not cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the possibilities for X and Y.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two products from their disproportionation, which doesn't have any double bonds. So Y has two alkanes. Then, the hydrogenation of X (alkenes) gives alkanes (Y), and the hydrogenation of Y (alkanes) gives nothing, but according to the problem, gives Z. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y isn't an alkane. Maybe Y is an alkane and another compound without double bonds, but not an alkane. Like an aromatic compound? No, because then it would have conjugated double bonds and decolorize bromine, but Y doesn't.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a dihydrogenation, but I don't think that term is correct. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration or some addition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. But then, when treated with Pt and H2, they might hydrogenate differently. For example, an alkyne would hydrogenate to an alkene with Pt, but wait, if it's a dihydrogenation, it becomes an alkane. Hmm, not sure.

But wait, the question says that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction. That usually implies that the same element or compound is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps one component in X is being hydrogenated (reduction) and another is being dehydrogenated (oxidation). But that's confusing because alkenes don't typically lose H2.

Wait, perhaps it's a [1,3] shift or some isomerization. I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should focus on the part where we need to find the number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Wait, the question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So, perhaps we can find the molecular formulas of the two liquids in X and add up the H atoms.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then when X is hydrogenated, each component in X must add H2 to become cyclohexane. Wait, but that would mean that each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene (C6H10) upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane, but that's only possible if the other alkene also becomes cyclohexane. For example, if the other component is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is C6H8. Hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, giving C6H12, which is cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then upon hydrogenation, both would give cyclohexane (C6H12).

So each component in X is a cyclic diene or mono-ene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

But wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids. So if they're both alkenes, perhaps each is a different cyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a different mono-alkene that upon hydrogenation gives the same cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem possible because different alkenes would give different alkanes upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexene and another structure, maybe a non-cyclic alkene, but that's unlikely. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. For example, if one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and the other is a different structure that upon hydrogenation also yields cyclohexane. But I can't think of a non-cyclic alkene that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components in X are the same but different isomers. For example, maybe two different diastereomers of an alkene, but that wouldn't change the product upon hydrogenation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the number of hydrogen atoms in X's components.

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12), then the alkenes must have two fewer hydrogens each than cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's not correct because cyclohexene is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So cyclohexene has 10 H's, and cyclohexane has 12. So the alkenes in X must have 10 H's each. Therefore, each component in X has 10 H's. So if X is a mixture of two such alkenes, each with C6H10, then each has 10 H's. So total in X would be 20 H's. But the options don't have 20 as an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the two alkenes in X are different. For example, one is C6H10 and the other is C5H10. But wait, if the other is C5H10, hydrogenation would give C5H12, which is pentane, not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem states that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, both must hydrogenate to Z. So Z must be the same as the hydrogenation product of both. So both alkenes in X must hydrogenate to the same Z.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of two substituted cyclohexenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexene. But upon hydrogenation, both would give the same product, 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane, which are different. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the two alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation gives the same product. For example, if one is a mono-ene and another is a di-ene, but both upon hydrogenation give the same product.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the initial mixture X. X is two alkenes, each with a certain number of H's. The total H's in X would be the sum of H's in both.

So, if each component in X has n H's, the total is 2n.

But what's the possible n?

Wait, Z is C6H12. So each component in X upon hydrogenation adds 2 H's per double bond. So, if X's component has a double bond, then during hydrogenation, the alkene (CnH2m) becomes an alkane (CnH2m+2). So, for Z to be C6H12, the alkene in X must have been C6H10. Because H10 + 2 = H12.

So, each component in X is C6H10. Therefore, each has 10 H's. So two components would have 20 H's in total. But the options don't have 20. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Hmm, perhaps the two alkenes in X are C5H10 and C7H14. Wait, no, that can't be because C7H14 is an alkane, not an alkene. Wait, no, C7H14 for alkenes would be incorrect because alkenes have two fewer H's than alkanes. For C7, alkane would be C7H16, so alkene would be C7H14. So X could be a mixture of C5H10 and C7H14. But when hydrogenated, they would become pentane (C5H12) and heptane (C7H16). But then, hydrogenation of X would give two products, not a single Z. So that contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the mixture X is a mixture of different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives the same Z. For that, perhaps the alkenes are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same product. But that's only possible if they are the same molecule in different configurations, which wouldn't be two separate components.

Wait, but perhaps X contains two different mono-alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same product. For example, if X is a mixture of 1-pentene and 2-pentene, but both would hydrogenate to pentane, which is the same. But then, the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids, but 1-pentene and 2-pentene are both liquids? I'm not sure about their physical states, but perhaps.

In that case, each component in X is C5H10 (a mono-alkene), so each has 10 H's. So two components would have 20 H's. But 20 isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps X isn't C5H10 but another structure. Let me think about Z again. Z is C6H12, which is cyclohexane. So, if X's alkenes upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane, then each X component must have been C6H10 (cyclohexene), which would have 10 H's. So each component in X has 10 H's, two components would have 20 H's in total. But the options don't include 20.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the initial alkenes in X are not cyclohexene but something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about possible H counts. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

If the total H in X is 18, that would imply that each component has 9 H's. So, if each component in X is a C4H8 alkene (which is an alkene), because 4 carbons would mean an alkene has 8 H's (since formula for alkene is CnH2n-2. So for n=4, H=6? Wait, no. Wait, for n=4, the alkene would be C4H8 (since 2n=8). So H=8.

Wait, so if X is a mixture of two C4H8 alkenes, each has 8 H's. So two would give 16 H's. But 16 is option A, but the options are 16, 18, etc.

Alternatively, maybe each component is C5H10, which has 10 H's. Two would sum to 20, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X have varying H counts. For example, one is C4H8 (8 H's) and the other is C5H10 (10 H's), giving a total of 18 H's. So the total would be 8 +10 =18, which is option B.

But then, upon hydrogenation, each would become C4H10 and C5H12, which are different alkanes. So the hydrogenation of X would give two products, which contradicts the problem statement that says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes with the same number of H's. For example, each is C5H10, so 10 H's each, totaling 20. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about cyclohexane. Let me re-examine the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: What if Z is not cyclohexane but something else?

If Z is C4H10, which is butane. Let's compute its H mass fraction.

Butane: 4*12 +10 =58 g/mol. H mass is 10 g. 10/58 ≈17.24%, which isn't 14.28%.

If Z is C7H16: H mass is 16, total mass 7*12+16= 92+16=108. 16/108≈14.81%, which is about 14.28% but not exact.

Wait, 14.28% is exactly 1/7. Let's see which compound gives exactly 1/7.

Earlier, for Z being C6H12 (cyclohexane), 12 H's, molecular weight 84. 12/84=1/7. So that fits.

So Z must be C6H12, cyclohexane.

So X must be a mixture of alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So each component in X must be C6H10.

But earlier that gives a total H of 20, which isn't an option.

Wait, unless X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with 8 H's. Then 8 *2=16 H's, which is option A.

But then, alkenes with 8 H's would be C5H10 (since 2n=10 for n=5), which upon hydrogenation would give C5H12, not cyclohexane.

Wait, this is getting frustrating.

Alternative approach: Since the problem gives the options, perhaps I can work backward.

The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Assume that the correct answer is 18. That would mean that the two alkenes in X have a total of 18 H's. So each has 9 H's. But how can an alkene have 9 H's?

Wait, for an alkene, the formula is CnH2n-2. So, if an alkene has m H's, then m=2n-2.

If m=9, then 2n-2=9 → 2n=11 → n=5.5, which isn't possible because n must be integer.

So 9 H's isn't possible for an alkene. So 18 total H's would require each component to have 9 H's, which isn't possible.

Hmm, perhaps the alkenes have 8 and 10 H's. 8+10=18. So option B is 18.

So each component would be C4H8 and C5H10.

But then, when X is hydrogenated, C4H8 would become C4H10, and C5H10 would become C5H12. So Y would be a mixture of C4H10 and C5H12. But according to the problem, hydrogenation of Y would give Z, which is cyclohexane.

But C4H10 upon hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions wouldn't change because it's an alkane. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of C3H6 and C5H10. Each has 6 and 10 H's, so total 16, which is option A.

But then, hydrogenation of X would give C3H8 and C5H12, which are alkanes. Then, hydrogenation of Y (the same as X's products) would give nothing, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are not simple mono-alkenes but are more complex, like tri-substituted or something else.

Another thought: What if X is a mixture of cyclopropane and another compound? No, cyclopropane is an alkane (no double bonds), so X wouldn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think again about the possible structures.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with the same number of H's, such that their total is one of the options.

For example, if each is C5H10, which has 10 H's, then two would have 20 H's. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each is C4H8, which has 8 H's, so two give 16 H's, option A.

But then, hydrogenation would give C4H10, which is butane, and that wouldn't match Z being cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the hydrogenation of Y. If Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't change them, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So maybe Y isn't alkanes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Y is a mixture of alkenes as well, but without conjugated double bonds. But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so no double bonds. So Y must be alkanes.

So, to recap, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each upon hydrogenation gives Z (cyclohexane). So each component in X must be C6H10, which upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12.

So each component has 10 H's. Two components would have 20 H's. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating Z's formula. Let me recheck.

If Z is C6H12, H mass is 12. Molar mass is 6*12 +12=72+12=84. 12/84=1/7, which is correct.

So, each component in X is C6H10. So 10 H's each. Two components: 20 H's. But that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the alkenes in X are not monocyclic. Maybe they're different. For example, perhaps one is a mono-alkene (C6H10) and the other is a di-alkene (C6H8). So each would hydrogenate to C6H12. So X is a mixture of C6H10 and C6H8.

Each component would have 10 and 8 H's, respectively. So total H's in X would be 18, which is option B.

Ah! That makes sense. Because each would hydrogenate to C6H12. So if X is a mixture of C6H10 (10 H's) and C6H8 (8 H's), then upon hydrogenation, each would add H2 to become C6H12. Thus, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclohexane.

So the total number of H's in X would be 10 +8=18, which is option B.

So the answer should be 18 H's in X.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, given the following conditions:

1. **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of alkenes (non-conjugated double bonds). Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y contains no double bonds.

2. **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X. Y does not decolorize bromine water, confirming it is saturated (alkanes).

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both mixtures, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, yield a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%, which corresponds to a molecular formula of **C₆H₁₂** (cyclohexane). Z is widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen.

4. **Key Deductions**:
   - Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), as it matches the mass fraction of hydrogen (14.28%) and is a saturated hydrocarbon.
   - X must be a mixture of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, yield Z. Therefore, the components of X are alkenes with the formula **C₆H₁₀** (monocyclic) and **C₆H₈** (bicyclic), which hydrogenate to **C₆H₁₂**.
   - Each component in X contributes a specific number of hydrogen atoms: **C₆H₁₀** contributes 10 hydrogens, and **C₆H₈** contributes 8 hydrogens.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is the sum of the hydrogens in both components:
     \[
     \text{Total H atoms} = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

**Answer: B**
