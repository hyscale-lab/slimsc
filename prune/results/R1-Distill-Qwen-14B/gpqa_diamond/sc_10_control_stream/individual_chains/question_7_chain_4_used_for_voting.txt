Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and its photons have a certain energy. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I need to find the energy at which the gamma-rays' lifetimes are limited by this process.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, that's a really low energy. So the CMB photons are low-energy, which makes sense because the universe has expanded and cooled a lot since the Big Bang.

The reaction is γγ → e+ e−. So a gamma-ray photon (high energy) and a CMB photon (low energy) collide and produce an electron and a positron. I think this process is relevant for determining the maximum energy of gamma-rays that can exist in the universe because once they're created, they might annihilate and thus limit their lifetime.

I remember something about the pair production threshold. For two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, their combined energy must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the two particles. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So two electrons would be 1.022 MeV total. But wait, in this case, the photon energies are much higher than that. So maybe the threshold is when the sum of their energies is at least 2 * m_e * c^2.

Wait, but considering that one photon is from the CMB and the other is the high-energy gamma. So the CMB photon is low energy, but the gamma is high. So how does this affect the calculation?

I think the process is that the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy to, when combined with the CMB photon, produce the rest mass of the pair. So the energy of the gamma photon, E_gamma, plus the energy of the CMB photon, E_cmb, should be at least 2 * m_e c^2.

But wait, photons don't just add their energies in the same frame. Because they're moving in opposite directions, right? Because in the rest frame of the CMB, the CMB photon is moving in a particular direction, and the gamma is moving in the opposite (since they're colliding). So the energy in the center-of-momentum frame is more important.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. The combined energy in the CM frame needs to be at least 2 m_e c^2 for pair production to happen. So the invariant quantity s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (since each photon's momentum is in opposite directions, it's p1 c - p2 c). But since photons have E = pc for each, perhaps I can express the invariant squared s as (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, if they're moving in opposite directions. Let me compute that.

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
Expanding that:
= (E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²) - (E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²)
= 4 E1 E2

So s = 4 E1 E2. For pair production, s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Simplifying, E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, because 4 E1 E2 ≥ 4 (m_e c^2)^2. So dividing both sides by 4, E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

So E_gamma * E_cmb ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

We can rearrange this to find E_gamma ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

But wait, considering that E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. Let me plug in the numbers.

m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV. Let me convert that to eV. 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (511,000 eV)^2.

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma ≥ (511000 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (511000^2) / (0.001) eV.

Let me compute that:

511000 squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11.

Divide that by 0.001: 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, wait. Hold on. Because E_gamma is in eV, but the options are in GeV. Let me convert eV to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

So 2.61121e14 eV divided by 1e9 is 2.61121e5 GeV. So approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. That seems to match.

But wait, wait a second. Is that correct? Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check:

E_gamma = ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / E_cmb

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 = 261,121,000,000 eV².

Divide by E_cmb (1e-3 eV): 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 = 2.61121e14 eV² / eV = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV ≈ 2.6e5 GeV.

So the energy is about 2.6e5 GeV. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but is there a factor I'm missing? Like, perhaps relativistic considerations or the cross-section dependence on energy?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy. But the question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. The process would be more probable at higher energies, but the threshold is when the energy is just enough to produce the pair.

So the calculation I did gives the threshold energy. So any gamma-ray with energy above this would have a finite probability to annihilate with CMB photons, thus limiting their lifetime. So the threshold energy is when E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So yes, the energy is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer is option C.

To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold energy required for this process. The reaction requires the combined energy of the gamma-ray photon ($\gamma$) and the CMB photon to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in the center-of-mass (CM) frame is given by:

\[
s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}
\]

For pair production to occur, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$. Substituting $s$, we find:

\[
4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2m_e c^2)^2
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, the threshold energy is:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$, and the average energy of CMB photons is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2}{0.001 \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus, the threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**

So two electrons would be 1.022 MeV total. But wait, in this case, the photon energies are much higher than that. So maybe the threshold is when the sum of their energies is at least 2 * m_e * c^2.

Wait, but considering that one photon is from the CMB and the other is the high-energy gamma. So the CMB photon is low energy, but the gamma is high. So how does this affect the calculation?

I think the process is that the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy to, when combined with the CMB photon, produce the rest mass of the pair. So the energy of the gamma photon, E_gamma, plus the energy of the CMB photon, E_cmb, should be at least 2 * m_e c^2.

Because in the rest frame of the CMB, the CMB photon is moving in a particular direction, and the gamma is moving in the opposite (since they're colliding). So the energy in the center-of-momentum frame is more important.

Hmm, maybe I should think about this in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. The combined energy in the CM frame needs to be at least 2 m_e c^2 for pair production to happen. So the invariant quantity s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (since each photon's momentum is in opposite directions, it's p1 c - p2 c). But since photons have E = pc for each, perhaps I can express the invariant squared s as (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, if they're moving in opposite directions. Let me compute that.

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
Expanding that:
= (E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²) - (E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²)
= 4 E1 E2

So s = 4 E1 E2. For pair production, s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Simplifying, E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, because 4 E1 E2 ≥ 4 (m_e c^2)^2. So dividing both sides by 4, E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

So E_gamma * E_cmb ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

We can rearrange this to find E_gamma ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_cmb.

But wait, considering that E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. Let me plug in the numbers.

m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV. Let me convert that to eV. 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (511,000 eV)^2.

E_cmb is 1e-3 eV.

So E_gamma ≥ (511000 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (511000^2) / (0.001) eV.

Let me compute that:

511000 squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11.

Divide that by 0.001: 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, wait. Hold on. Because E_gamma is in eV, but the options are in GeV. Let me convert eV to GeV.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

So 2.61121e14 eV divided by 1e9 is 2.61121e5 GeV. So approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. That seems to match.

But wait, wait a second. Is that correct? Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check:

E_gamma = ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / E_cmb

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 = 261,121,000,000 eV².

Divide by E_cmb (1e-3 eV): 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 = 2.61121e14 eV² / eV = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV ≈ 2.6e5 GeV.

So the energy is about 2.6e5 GeV. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but is there a factor I'm missing? Like, perhaps relativistic considerations or the cross-section dependence on energy?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy. But the question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process.

So the calculation I did gives the threshold energy. So any gamma-ray with energy above this would have a finite probability to annihilate with CMB photons, thus limiting their lifetime. So the threshold energy is when E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So yes, the energy is approximately 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer is option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold energy required for this process. The reaction requires the combined energy of the gamma-ray photon ($\gamma$) and the CMB photon to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2$. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in the center-of-mass (CM) frame is given by:

\[
s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}
\]

For pair production to occur, $s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2$. Substituting $s$, we find:

\[
4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2m_e c^2)^2
\]

Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, the threshold energy is:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
\]

The rest energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}$, and the average energy of CMB photons is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2}{0.001 \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}{10^9 \, \text{eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus, the threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**
