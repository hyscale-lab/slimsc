Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. So, the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The main points are about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm.

First, the question has two parts: part A and part B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Part A: We need to identify which compound does not show tautomerism. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen atom and the simultaneous movement of a bond, resulting in a different structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form. So, which of these compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Quinones are known for their keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone should undergo tautomerism. But what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That compound has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring. Each ketone is adjacent to another? Wait, in 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5. So each is separated by one carbon. They are conjugated? So, does that allow for tautomerism?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. For a compound to show tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. In the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, so the alpha carbons are the ones attached to the ring. But wait, quinones have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls, but do they have alpha hydrogens?

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C(=O)O? No, wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-O, but that's not right. Let me correct myself. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, so the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the carbonyl groups are on positions 1 and 2, I think, but maybe 1 and 4? Wait, no, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, which would typically be para positions, like 1,4-benzoquinone.

But regardless, the carbonyl carbons are on the ring. So if the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4, then the adjacent carbons (on the ring) are each attached to two other carbons. Wait, no, the benzene ring has each carbon connected to two others. So the alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So each carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (like C2 and C6 for C1) are each attached to another ring carbon. So those adjacent carbons don't have any hydrogens attached because each is part of the benzene ring, which is sp² hybridized. Wait, do they have hydrogens?

Wait, benzene rings are sp², so each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen unless substituted. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like C2 and C6 for C1) are each bonded to one hydrogen. So the alpha carbons have hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens and thus can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? The structure is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is separated by one carbon. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, perhaps? Wait, no. Let me think. The ring would be six-membered, with three ketone groups. So positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, each connected to a CH₂ group on either side. Wait, no. Each ketone is at a carbon, which is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So each carbonyl is at a carbon that's adjacent to two other carbons, each of which is a CH₂.

Wait, no, maybe it's more like O=C-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂- but in a ring. Wait, no. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione must have three carbonyl groups alternating with two CH₂ groups in the six-membered ring.

So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. So the carbons at positions 2,4,6 are CH₂. So each carbonyl group is at a carbon with two adjacent CH₂ groups.

So each carbonyl (C=O) is attached to a CH₂ group on either side. So the alpha carbons are the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. Wait, no, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So in this case, each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The adjacent carbons are C2, C6 for C1; C4, C2 for C3; C4, C6 for C5. So the adjacent carbons are C2, C4, and C6.

Each of these (C2, C4, C6) is connected to two CH₂ groups. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon (C2, C4, C6) is a CH₂ group. Each of these CH₂ groups is adjacent to a carbonyl. So each CH₂ has two H atoms.

Wait, but wait. The alpha carbons must have at least one hydrogen to allow for tautomerism. So if each alpha carbon is CH₂, that means they have two hydrogens. So they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, right?

But wait, if you have all the alpha positions as CH₂, maybe the structure is symmetric. Let me think. So, for the keto-enol tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon (C2, C4, C6) is a CH₂ group with two H's. So each of these could potentially lose a hydrogen, leading to the formation of an enol.

Wait, but the problem is that all three carbonyl groups are conjugated. So, perhaps the enol form is possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't conducive to tautomerism because of the symmetry?

Wait, another thought. When you have a conjugated system, like all three carbonyls are conjugated, maybe the enol tautomer is more stabilized, or maybe it's not possible. Or perhaps the ring is too strained for the enol form to be stable.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is highly symmetrical, making tautomerism not possible because all the positions are the same. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, maybe it doesn't have distinct enol forms.

Wait, wait, another angle. Tautomerism requires that the molecule can shift a hydrogen from an alpha position to the carbonyl, forming an enol. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, all the alpha positions are equivalent, so when you lose a hydrogen, the molecule remains symmetrical, so maybe it doesn't lead to a different tautomer.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. But that can't be right because C2, C4, C6 are CH₂, which have two hydrogens each.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the compounds again. Benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. So if the question is which does NOT undergo tautomerism, maybe it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, why would that be? Maybe the ring structure doesn't allow for the necessary movement. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that the enol form is the same as the keto form. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is too strained, and the enol form would not be possible.

Wait, another approach: in which case tautomerism is not possible? For example, a compound without any alpha hydrogens can't tautomerize. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, then it can't tautomerize. But earlier, I thought it does have alpha hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps because all the alpha carbons are quaternary. No, wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha carbons are C2, C4, C6. Each is CH₂, so they have two H's. So they have alpha hydrogens. So that can't be the reason.

Maybe the issue is that all the carbonyl groups are in conjugation, so the enol form is the same as the keto form. For example, if all three carbonyls are conjugated, the enol form doesn't change the structure because it's a ring. So maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form isn't distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is too symmetrical. Let me think. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is symmetric, then any tautomer would just be the same as the original structure. For example, if you shift a hydrogen from one alpha position, the molecule remains identical because of its symmetry. So the enol form is the same as the keto form. Therefore, no tautomerism occurs.

That makes sense. So in that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone does. So part A's answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So for part A, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, each with alpha hydrogens. So it can tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps the enol form isn't possible because of the ring's structure. Alternatively, maybe the enol form is not a different structure because of symmetry, so the molecule doesn't have a distinct enol form. Hence, no tautomerism. So that would mean that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, so A is that compound.

So part A is answered: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, it can occur in other ways, like in allenes or other structures with multiple stereogenic elements.

Let's look at each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, more accurately, it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, but as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate ester: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CHOHCOOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C(CH3)(OH)

Wait, the carbon chain is: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- and another carbon (the one adjacent to the COOCH3 group, which is a CH2?)

Wait, no. Let me draw it: The structure is HO-CH2-COOCH3 attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- and another CH2 from where? Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), and two other groups: one hydrogen (from OH) and one hydrogen (since it's 2-hydroxy, so the structure is CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should depict the structure as CH3-C-OH and COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and another CH2?

Wait, no. Each carbon is connected to four atoms. So in CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the middle carbon (C2) is bonded to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- and another H? Because it's CH(OH) group.

Wait, so the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

But wait, that would make the molecule CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- COOCH3 (C3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

So the four substituents on C2 are:

1. CH3 (from C1)
2. COOCH3 (from C3)
3. OH
4. H

So that's four different groups. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CHCH-CO2H. When both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: OMe-C-CH-CH-CO2Me.

Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH-CH-C(O)OCH3. So the double bond is between the two middle carbons (C2 and C3). So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is (Z)- or (E)-? No, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, right?

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis (Z) isomer, while fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-C(=CH₂)-CO₂H? No, wait. Let me correct.

Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the structure is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents on each are the same: each has a COOH group on C1 and C4, respectively. Wait, no, if it's fumaric acid, the substituents on each end of the double bond are hydroxyl and the carboxylic acid groups? I think I might be mixing up maleic and fumaric acids.

Wait, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H (but that's not correct because that's succinic acid). No, wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So it's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H? No, wait, no, that's four carbons. Maleic acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H with the substituents (the COOH groups) on the same side of the double bond, making it the cis (Z) isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer, where the substituents are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with both COOH groups esterified to OCH3. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, where the double bond is trans.

Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism? For a compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of chirality or a center of chirality.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate: the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. Let's see:

Each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3) and another substituent (like a CH3 from the ester). Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (at C1)
|
CH₂-CH₂ (but wait, no, it's a double bond: CH₂=CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, wait, no, for fumarate, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the double bond. So each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3) and CH.
C3: CH and C(O)OCH3.

Wait, each of these (C2 and C3) is attached to two OCH3 groups? No, wait. Let me think of the structure again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, no. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3), CH (from C3), and two hydrogens?
Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons. Let's think: the four substituents on C2 are:

- O=C(OCH3) (from C1)
- CH (from C3)
- Two H's?

No, wait, each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) is bonded to two substituents besides the double bond. For fumarate, C2 has O=C(OCH3) and CH (with another substituent?), but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a structure with two ester groups on either end of a trans double bond. So each of C2 and C3 would have substituents on either side. So, for C2: it has O=C(OCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond to C3. But wait, if it's a double bond, then each carbon is bonded to two groups besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of optical isomerism. For a molecule to have enantiomers, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on each end. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Wait, if the double bond is trans (E), then the substituents on each carbon are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. Hmm, but wait.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to two OCH3 groups. Wait, no. Let's think again: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, okay, maybe the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. Wait, but that would imply four carbons in total. So:

1: O=C(OCH3)
2: CH
3: CH
4: C(O)OCH3

But wait, that's not possible because the double bond is between C2 and C3, so C2 and C3 each have two substituents. So C2 has O=C(OCH3) and CH, and C3 has CH and C(O)OCH3. But that would make each of these carbons have two substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the numbering.

Actually, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, wait, that's a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3, but that can't be right because that would imply a single bond. Hmm, I think I'm confusing fumarate and succinate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look at each carbon.

The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3, which is a single bond, meaning it's not fumarate but succinate. So I must be wrong. So fumarate must have a double bond.

Ah, okay, correct structure of dimethyl fumarate: it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So the double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those (the two CH groups) has substituents. Let's look at each CH in the double bond.

C2: connected to O=C(OCH3), a CH (from C3), and two H's? No, wait. Each CH in the double bond is connected to two substituents besides the double bond. So C2 is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3)
- CH (double bond to C3)
- and two substituents (maybe H's?)

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to one OCH3 group and one H. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the diacid has the structure with two carboxylic acid groups on either end of a double bond. So when esterified with methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3.

So dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So each of the CH groups in the double bond (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: O=C(OCH3), CH (double bond to C3), and two H's.
Similarly, C3: CH (double bond to C2), C(O)OCH3, and two H's.

So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has two H's, one O=C(OCH3), and one CH (double bond). So each of these carbons has two identical substituents (the H's). So for each, the substituents are H, H, O=C(OCH3), and the double bond to C3 (or C2). Therefore, each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups (the H's), so they aren't chiral centers.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetrical in some way, then it may not have enantiomers. Since fumarate is the trans isomer, the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. So it's not chiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that dimethyl fumarate's structure might have a possibility of cis or trans, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So if the question is about optical isomerism, it's about enantiomers, not diastereomers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate can't because it doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but wait another angle: sometimes, even if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can have another form of chirality, like a center of symmetry or something else. But I don't think that's the case here.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism (A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione).

Part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

Looking at the options:

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches our conclusion.

Wait, let's check all options:

Options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → matches our conclusion.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → no, because A should be the one without tautomerism.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate → no, because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → no.

So the correct option is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the answers to the given question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the concepts of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

---

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It has alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) and can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone shows tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The alpha carbons (C2, C4, and C6) are CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. However, the molecule is highly symmetrical, and any enol form would not produce a distinct structure due to this symmetry. As a result, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH₃)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH₃. The double bond between C2 and C3 is in the trans configuration (E-isomer). However, neither C2 nor C3 is a chiral center because they are each bonded to two identical groups (hydrogens). Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer

From the analysis above:

- **A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** (does not show tautomerism).  
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).  

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. So, the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The main points are about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm.

First, the question has two parts: part A and part B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Part A: We need to identify which compound does not show tautomerism. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen atom and the simultaneous movement of a bond, resulting in a different structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize to an enol form. So, which of these compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Quinones are known for their keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone should undergo tautomerism. But what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That compound has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring. Each ketone is adjacent to another? Wait, in 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are at positions 1,3,5. So each is separated by one carbon. They are conjugated? So, does that allow for tautomerism?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. For a compound to show tautomerism, it needs to have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. In the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, so the alpha carbons are the ones attached to the ring. But wait, quinones have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls, but do they have alpha hydrogens?

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C(=O)O? No, wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-O, but that's not right. Let me correct myself. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, so the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the carbonyl groups are on positions 1 and 2, I think, but maybe 1 and 4? Wait, no, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O, which would typically be para positions, like 1,4-benzoquinone.

But regardless, the carbonyl carbons are on the ring. So if the carbonyl is at position 1 and 4, then the adjacent carbons (on the ring) are each attached to two other carbons. Wait, no, the benzene ring has each carbon connected to two others. So the alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So each carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (like C2 and C6 for C1) are each attached to another ring carbon. So those adjacent carbons don't have any hydrogens attached because each is part of the benzene ring, which is sp² hybridized. Wait, do they have hydrogens?

Wait, benzene rings are sp², so each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen unless substituted. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like C2 and C6 for C1) are each bonded to one hydrogen. So the alpha carbons have hydrogens. Therefore, benzoquinone should have alpha hydrogens and thus can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone can tautomerize.

Now, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? The structure is a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each carbonyl is separated by one carbon. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. So each carbonyl is attached to a CH₂ group, perhaps? Wait, no. Let me think. The ring would be six-membered, with three ketone groups. So positions 1,3,5 are carbonyls, each connected to a CH₂ group on either side. Wait, no. Each ketone is at a carbon, which is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So each carbonyl is at a carbon that's adjacent to two other carbons, each of which is a CH₂.

Wait, no, maybe it's more like O=C-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂- but in a ring. Wait, no. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione must have three carbonyl groups alternating with two CH₂ groups in the six-membered ring.

So each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. So the carbons at positions 2,4,6 are CH₂. So each carbonyl group is at a carbon with two adjacent CH₂ groups.

So each carbonyl (C=O) is attached to a CH₂ group on either side. So the alpha carbons are the CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. Wait, no, the alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So in this case, each carbonyl is at C1, C3, C5. The adjacent carbons are C2, C6 for C1; C4, C2 for C3; C4, C6 for C5. So the adjacent carbons are C2, C4, and C6.

Each of these (C2, C4, C6) is connected to two CH₂ groups. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon (C2, C4, C6) is a CH₂ group. Each of these CH₂ groups is adjacent to a carbonyl. So each CH₂ has two H atoms.

Wait, but wait. The alpha carbons must have at least one hydrogen to allow for tautomerism. So if each alpha carbon is CH₂, that means they have two hydrogens. So they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, right?

But wait, if you have all the alpha positions as CH₂, maybe the structure is symmetric. Let me think. So, for the keto-enol tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon (C2, C4, C6) is a CH₂ group with two H's. So each of these could potentially lose a hydrogen, leading to the formation of an enol.

Wait, but the problem is that all three carbonyl groups are conjugated. So, perhaps the enol form is possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't conducive to tautomerism because of the symmetry?

Wait, another thought. When you have a conjugated system, like all three carbonyls are conjugated, maybe the enol tautomer is more stabilized, or maybe it's not possible. Or perhaps the ring is too strained for the enol form to be stable.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is highly symmetrical, making tautomerism not possible because all the positions are the same. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, maybe it doesn't have distinct enol forms.

Wait, wait, another angle. Tautomerism requires that the molecule can shift a hydrogen from an alpha position to the carbonyl, forming an enol. But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, all the alpha positions are equivalent, so when you lose a hydrogen, the molecule remains symmetrical, so maybe it doesn't lead to a different tautomer.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any alpha hydrogens. But that can't be right because C2, C4, C6 are CH₂, which have two hydrogens each.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the compounds again. Benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. So if the question is which does NOT undergo tautomerism, maybe it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, why would that be? Maybe the ring structure doesn't allow for the necessary movement. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that the enol form is the same as the keto form. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is too strained, and the enol form would not be possible.

Wait, another approach: in which case tautomerism is not possible? For example, a compound without any alpha hydrogens can't tautomerize. So if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, then it can't tautomerize. But earlier, I thought it does have alpha hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps because all the alpha carbons are quaternary. No, wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the alpha carbons are C2, C4, C6. Each is CH₂, so they have two H's. So they have alpha hydrogens. So that can't be the reason.

Maybe the issue is that all the carbonyl groups are in conjugation, so the enol form is the same as the keto form. For example, if all three carbonyls are conjugated, the enol form doesn't change the structure because it's a ring. So maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because the enol form isn't distinct.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is too symmetrical. Let me think. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is symmetric, then any tautomer would just be the same as the original structure. For example, if you shift a hydrogen from one alpha position, the molecule remains identical because of its symmetry. So the enol form is the same as the keto form. Therefore, no tautomerism occurs.

That makes sense. So in that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone does. So part A's answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So for part A, A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, each with alpha hydrogens. So it can tautomerize. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, perhaps the enol form isn't possible because of the ring's structure. Alternatively, maybe the enol form is not a different structure because of symmetry, so the molecule doesn't have a distinct enol form. Hence, no tautomerism. So that would mean that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism, so A is that compound.

So part A is answered: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Now, part B: among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (or enantiomerism) occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, it can occur in other ways, like in allenes or other structures with multiple stereogenic elements.

Let's look at each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, more accurately, it's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Let me think again. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, but as an ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate ester: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CHOHCOOCH3, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C(CH3)(OH)

Wait, the carbon chain is: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- and another carbon (the one adjacent to the COOCH3 group, which is a CH2?)

Wait, no. Let me draw it: The structure is HO-CH2-COOCH3 attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- and another CH2 from where? Wait, carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), and two other groups: one hydrogen (from OH) and one hydrogen (since it's 2-hydroxy, so the structure is CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should depict the structure as CH3-C-OH and COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is: CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- and another CH2?

Wait, no. Each carbon is connected to four atoms. So in CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the middle carbon (C2) is bonded to:

- C1: CH3
- C3: COOCH3
- OH
- and another H? Because it's CH(OH) group.

Wait, so the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

But wait, that would make the molecule CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3 (C1)
- COOCH3 (C3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

So the four substituents on C2 are:

1. CH3 (from C1)
2. COOCH3 (from C3)
3. OH
4. H

So that's four different groups. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO2C-CHCH-CO2H. When both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: OMe-C-CH-CH-CO2Me.

Wait, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH-CH-C(O)OCH3. So the double bond is between the two middle carbons (C2 and C3). So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait, fumaric acid is (Z)- or (E)-? No, fumaric acid is the trans isomer, right?

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is the cis (Z) isomer, while fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer. So dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-C(=CH₂)-CO₂H? No, wait. Let me correct.

Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the structure is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituents on each are the same: each has a COOH group on C1 and C4, respectively. Wait, no, if it's fumaric acid, the substituents on each end of the double bond are hydroxyl and the carboxylic acid groups? I think I might be mixing up maleic and fumaric acids.

Wait, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H (but that's not correct because that's succinic acid). No, wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. So it's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-CO₂H? No, wait, no, that's four carbons. Maleic acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H with the substituents (the COOH groups) on the same side of the double bond, making it the cis (Z) isomer. Fumaric acid is the trans (E) isomer, where the substituents are on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with both COOH groups esterified to OCH3. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, where the double bond is trans.

Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism? For a compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of chirality or a center of chirality.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate: the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. Let's see:

Each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3) and another substituent (like a CH3 from the ester). Wait, no, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (at C1)
|
CH₂-CH₂ (but wait, no, it's a double bond: CH₂=CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, wait, no, for fumarate, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the double bond. So each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3) and CH.
C3: CH and C(O)OCH3.

Wait, each of these (C2 and C3) is attached to two OCH3 groups? No, wait. Let me think of the structure again.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, no. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, that would be succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

C2: O=C(OCH3), CH (from C3), and two hydrogens?
Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons. Let's think: the four substituents on C2 are:

- O=C(OCH3) (from C1)
- CH (from C3)
- Two H's?

No, wait, each carbon in the double bond (C2 and C3) is bonded to two substituents besides the double bond. For fumarate, C2 has O=C(OCH3) and CH (with another substituent?), but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate has a structure with two ester groups on either end of a trans double bond. So each of C2 and C3 would have substituents on either side. So, for C2: it has O=C(OCH3), a hydrogen, and the double bond to C3. But wait, if it's a double bond, then each carbon is bonded to two groups besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibility of optical isomerism. For a molecule to have enantiomers, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on each end. So the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Wait, if the double bond is trans (E), then the substituents on each carbon are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical. Hmm, but wait.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to two OCH3 groups. Wait, no. Let's think again: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond.

Wait, okay, maybe the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. Wait, but that would imply four carbons in total. So:

1: O=C(OCH3)
2: CH
3: CH
4: C(O)OCH3

But wait, that's not possible because the double bond is between C2 and C3, so C2 and C3 each have two substituents. So C2 has O=C(OCH3) and CH, and C3 has CH and C(O)OCH3. But that would make each of these carbons have two substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the numbering.

Actually, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3. No, wait, that's a single bond. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3, but that can't be right because that would imply a single bond. Hmm, I think I'm confusing fumarate and succinate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look at each carbon.

The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3, which is a single bond, meaning it's not fumarate but succinate. So I must be wrong. So fumarate must have a double bond.

Ah, okay, correct structure of dimethyl fumarate: it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So the double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those (the two CH groups) has substituents. Let's look at each CH in the double bond.

C2: connected to O=C(OCH3), a CH (from C3), and two H's? No, wait. Each CH in the double bond is connected to two substituents besides the double bond. So C2 is connected to:

- O=C(OCH3)
- CH (double bond to C3)
- and two substituents (maybe H's?)

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to one OCH3 group and one H. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. So the diacid has the structure with two carboxylic acid groups on either end of a double bond. So when esterified with methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3.

So dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH3. So each of the CH groups in the double bond (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: O=C(OCH3), CH (double bond to C3), and two H's.
Similarly, C3: CH (double bond to C2), C(O)OCH3, and two H's.

So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has two H's, one O=C(OCH3), and one CH (double bond). So each of these carbons has two identical substituents (the H's). So for each, the substituents are H, H, O=C(OCH3), and the double bond to C3 (or C2). Therefore, each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups (the H's), so they aren't chiral centers.

Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetrical in some way, then it may not have enantiomers. Since fumarate is the trans isomer, the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond axis. So it's not chiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. So part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that dimethyl fumarate's structure might have a possibility of cis or trans, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So if the question is about optical isomerism, it's about enantiomers, not diastereomers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can show optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate can't because it doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, but wait another angle: sometimes, even if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can have another form of chirality, like a center of symmetry or something else. But I don't think that's the case here.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism (A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione).

Part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate).

Looking at the options:

Option A says A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That matches our conclusion.

Wait, let's check all options:

Options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → matches our conclusion.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → no, because A should be the one without tautomerism.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate → no, because B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → no.

So the correct option is option A.


To determine the answers to the given question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the concepts of tautomerism and optical isomerism.

---

### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. It has alpha hydrogens (hydrogens attached to carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) and can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone shows tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The alpha carbons (C2, C4, and C6) are CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. However, the molecule is highly symmetrical, and any enol form would not produce a distinct structure due to this symmetry. As a result, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

---

### Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 (the one attached to the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   The structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH₃)-CH=CH-C(O)OCH₃. The double bond between C2 and C3 is in the trans configuration (E-isomer). However, neither C2 nor C3 is a chiral center because they are each bonded to two identical groups (hydrogens). Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer

From the analysis above:

- **A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** (does not show tautomerism).  
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).  

The correct option is **A**.

**Answer: A**
