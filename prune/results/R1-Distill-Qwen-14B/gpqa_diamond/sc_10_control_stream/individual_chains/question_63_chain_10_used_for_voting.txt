Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The elements are X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model... I remember that for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational states are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state with the lowest energy. But wait, what's the next state? Like, does it increase the vibrational state or the rotational state?

I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state would be the first excited state, but I'm not sure if it's a change in rotation, vibration, or a combination of both.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right! That's the first excited state. So the photon must cause the molecule to transition to the next energy level, which could involve either increasing the vibrational state or the rotational state. But which transition requires less energy?

Vibrational energy levels are quantized with much higher spacing than rotational ones. So the energy difference between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational. So to get the lowest possible photon energy (and thus the smallest momentum, since p = h/λ and E=pc for photons), the photon should cause a transition to the next rotational state, not vibration.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The fundamental state is the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be either increasing the vibrational quantum number by one (v=1) or the rotational (r=1). The energy difference for vibration is much larger than for rotation. So if the photon provides the minimal energy, maybe it's the rotational transition.

But the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, maybe the energy levels are treated as a combination of both. Hmm. Or perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor with quantized vibrational states?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model might include both rotation and vibration. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy for a diatomic molecule can be split into vibrational and rotational parts. The total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the rigid rotor approximation, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B r (r+1), where r is the rotational quantum number and B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (n + 1/2), where n is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, no. Actually, the harmonic oscillator model for vibrations gives E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, and the rotational energy is E_rot = B r (r +1). So the fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (r=0). The next state would have either r=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). Which requires less energy change?

The energy difference for vibration is h w. For rotation, the change when r goes from 0 to 1 is E_rot = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

But wait, what is B? The rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², with μ being the reduced mass and R the bond length.

So let's compute B. First, I need to find μ, the reduced mass.

Masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) amu. 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ Let me do 1.8 *1.66 = 2.988. So about 3e-27 kg? Wait, precise calculation: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

Compute 1.818 *1.6605: Let's do 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, and 0.018 *1.6605≈0.0299. So total approx 2.9889 +0.0299=3.0188. So 3.0188e-27 kg.

Then I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

I = (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now B = ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h-bar, 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Now the energy difference for rotation from r=0 to r=1 is 2B.

2B = 9.2e-23 J.

For vibration, the energy difference from n=0 to n=1 is h w. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, that's way larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon would cause a transition to the next rotational state, which is r=1, but wait, can we have that?

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would be either r=1 (v=0) or n=1 (r=0). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one that would be taken by a photon with lower energy. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference for the rotational transition from r=0 to r=1.

Wait, but wait, maybe the model is such that the energy levels are a combination of both. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the fundamental state is (n=0, r=0). The next state could be either (n=1, r=0) or (n=0, r=1). Which transition requires less energy? Well, the vibrational transition requires h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, but the rotational requires 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. The latter is much smaller.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the rotational energy difference, so the molecule goes from (r=0) to (r=1), and remains in the same vibrational state.

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one that's the next in energy order, regardless of which mode it's in. So the transition with the smallest energy difference would be the rotational one. So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. The vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than the rotational. So transition from n=0 to n=1 requires 2.65e-19 J, whereas transition from r=0 to r=1 requires 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the photon with the lower energy is needed for the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because momentum p of a photon is p = E/c. Because for a photon, E = pc.

So E = 9.2e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23)/(3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute that:

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 = approximately 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. But wait, looking at the options, the units are N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So 3.066e-31 kg·m/s is 3.066e-31 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N*s

B) 2.3e-27 N*s

C) 1.1e-27 N*s

D) 1.4e-28 N*s

Hmm. My calculation gives about 3e-31 N*s, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recalculate.

Calculating μ again. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889; 0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.02996. So total is 2.9889 + 0.02996 ≈ 3.01886e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.01886e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01886e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20754e-46 kg·m².

B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.20754e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) = let's compute 1.112 / 2.415 ≈ 0.46.

So 0.46e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait. 2.415e-46 is denominator: 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J. So B is 4.6e-23 J.

Then 2B is 9.2e-23 J. So the energy of the photon is 9.2e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.066e-31 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match. So did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I confused the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy levels are E = B r (r+1). So the transition from r=0 (E=0) to r=1 (E=2B) requires ΔE=2B.

But perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which would have a much larger photon energy. Because if you have a photon with higher energy, like the vibrational transition, the options are in the 1e-27 or 1e-28 range.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s = 8.8347e-28 N·s.

Hmm, that's 8.83e-28 N·s. Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28), but not exactly.

Wait, but perhaps the transition isn't just a single quantum in vibration, but maybe a combination of both rotation and vibration. Oh, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should cause the minimal energy transition. So that's the rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, that would be 3e-31 N·s, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molecule's vibrational energy as part of the state, and the transition is a combination. Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the fundamental vibration plus rotation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular energy levels are considered with both vibrational and rotational contributions. The fundamental state is (v=0, r=0). The next state is (v=0, r=1), which is the next higher energy state.

So the energy required is the rotational transition.

But why is my calculation not matching the options? Let me check the numbers another way.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for B is incorrect.

Let me double-check the calculation of B. B is ħ²/(2 I).

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.207e-46) ) = (1.112e-68)/(2.414e-46) = (1.112 /2.414) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Then p = E/c = (9.2e-23)/(3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the first excited vibrational state. Let's compute that.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 N s. The options given are A) 1.9e-28, D) 1.4e-28, etc.

So neither 3e-31 nor 8.8e-28 match the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in the context of the molecule's center of mass motion. Or maybe it's about the change in momentum of the molecule.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels also include both rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is the lowest in both, and the next state is the first excited in either.

But why is the calculated momentum not matching any options?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me double-check.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I'm using the wrong unit conversion? 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters? Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's momentum is not E/c, but something else. Wait, no, the momentum of a photon is p = E/c.

Wait, perhaps I should be using relativistic considerations? No, for photon, E=pc holds exactly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the first vibrational state, but I miscalculated the energy.

Wait, let me compute h w again. h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options are near this. So perhaps the model expects something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition but I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me recompute B.

μ = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R^2 = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20. So I=3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, is this correct? Because 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, so 1.112e-68 /2.414e-46 is about (1.112/2.414)*1e-22 ≈ 0.46e-22=4.6e-23 J.

Yes.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the model expects the energy to be the sum of both rotation and vibration. Or maybe the problem is about the transition to the next state, which could be a combination, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between the first rotational and the first vibrational state. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0), and the first excited rotational state (r=1). The energy for that is E_rot= 2B.

But when it absorbs a photon, it could transition to n=1 and r=0, which has E_vib= h w, or to r=1 with E_rot=2B.

The photon's energy should match the lower of the two, so the rotational transition.

But again, the calculated p is way smaller than the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor model, where the rotational energy is quantized, but treating the vibrational energy as an adjustment. Or perhaps I need to calculate the vibrational energy difference for the fundamental state.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational energy but the vibrational. Let me see the options again.

Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of 1e-27. Hmm.

Wait, let me calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

The closest option is D:1.4e-28. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4=26.504, but 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20. So 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

So 2.65e-19 J/c. c is 3e8 m/s.

So 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

Wait, the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the rotational transition but I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia I is μ R², which I have, but perhaps B is in cm-1 instead of Joules. Because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in wavenumbers. Hmm.

Wait, what's the rotational constant B in terms of cm-1?

B (in cm-1) is (h/(8 π² c I)) ), or maybe another formula. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute B in terms of energy per molecule.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational constant in terms of frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E = B r(r+1), where B is the rotational constant in Joules.

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, which is the wavenumber.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me consider another approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, r=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, r=0). So the energy change is h w.

Thus, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is E/c = h w /c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Momentum p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in something else.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu +2 amu) =40/(22) amu = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as R=2 angstroms, but in the calculation, I used 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the way I calculated the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 π² I c)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are E = (r + 1/2) h c B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

Wait, I think I did it right earlier. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the rotational transition to require an energy of h c B, where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1. Wait, maybe I should compute B in cm^-1.

Wait, the rotational constant B in cm^-1 is given by B = h/(8 π² c I) ), where I is the moment of inertia in kg m².

Wait, let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s, I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 *pi^2 *3e8 *1.207e-46 )

Calculate denominator: 8 * (9.8696) [since pi^2≈9.8696] *3e8 *1.207e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.207e-46 =2.861e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.861e-36 ≈2313 cm^-1.

Hmm, 2313 cm^-1. So the energy difference when r changes from 0 to 1 is 2B, which in cm^-1 is 4626 cm^-1.

But converting that to energy: E = h c B, where B is in cm^-1. So E =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2313.

=6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25; *2313= approx 1.9878e-25 *2.313e3≈4.6e-22 J.

Wait, that's close to 4.6e-23 J. Wait, earlier calculation was 2B=9.2e-23 J, which is about 4.6e-23 *2.

Hmm, but I'm getting confused again. Perhaps I should find the energy in Joules using this method.

Wait, the rotational energy transition from r=0 to r=1 is 2B, where B is the rotational constant in J.

Earlier calculation gave B=4.6e-23 J, so 2B=9.2e-23 J. Then p =9.2e-23 /3e8=3e-31 N s.

But again, this isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the way the rotational energy is considered. The energy levels are E_r = B r(r+1), but the spacing between r and r+1 is not just 2B, but the difference between (r+1)(r+2)B and r(r+1)B.

Which is [ (r+1)(r+2) - r(r+1) ] B = (r+1)(2) B. So for r=0, the difference is 2B. For r=1, it's 4B, etc.

So for r=0 to r=1, it's 2B. So that part was correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck because my calculations don't match the options. Perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, not rotational, and I should recheck that.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E = h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects the photon's energy to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions. That is, the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=1, r=1).

But that complicates things, and the energy would be higher than both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition within the rotation-vibration model where the next state is the first vibrationally excited state with the same rotational state. So E = h w. But that gives a p of 8.8e-28, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me check that.

Mass X is 20 amu, mass Y is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22 =1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where the mistake is. Let me think about the options again. The option closest to 8.8e-28 is option A:1.9e-28 and D:1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between the first rotational and the first vibrational state, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing frequency with wavenumber. The given w is angular frequency (ω), but sometimes people use wavenumbers (cm^-1) which are related to frequency by c= speed of light.

Wait, the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 is h w. So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=8.83e-28 N s.

None of the options match. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the momentum of the molecule, not the photon. Wait, no, the question says the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor? Let me think about the units.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. So E = h f = h c / λ.

Photon momentum p = E/c = (h f)/c = h/(lambda c) [No, that's not right. p = h/(lambda), since p = E/c and E= h f = h c /lambda. So p= h/(lambda)= h f/c.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: compute the energy in terms of the rotational transition and see if any option matches.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is in terms of the wavenumber. Let me compute B in wavenumbers again.

Earlier, I found B in cm^-1 to be approximately 2313 cm^-1. So the energy in Joules is E = h c B.

h =6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s, B=2313 cm^-1=231300 m^-1.

So E =6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 231300: 1.9878e-25 *2.313e5 ≈ 4.6e-20 J.

Wait, that's 4.6e-20 J. p=4.6e-20 /3e8=1.53e-28 N s.

Hmm, that's close to option D:1.4e-28.

Wait, yes! 1.53e-28 is approximately 1.5e-28, which is close to option D:1.4e-28.

But wait, why did this approach give a different result?

Ah, because earlier when I calculated B in Joules, I got B=4.6e-23 J. That would mean E_rot = 2B =9.2e-23 J. But when I calculated B in cm^-1, I found E_rot =4.6e-20 J.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let's clarify: B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant, which when multiplied by h c gives the energy in J.

So if B =2313 cm^-1, E_rot for r=1 is E= (1)(2) * h c B.

Wait, no, E_rot = B r(r+1). So for r=1, E=2 B. So E=2 * h c B.

Wait, no, B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers. So the energy levels are E_r = r(r+1) * h c B.

So when r=0, E=0. When r=1, E=2 h c B.

So the energy difference between r=0 and r=1 is 2 h c B.

So with B=2313 cm^-1,

E = 2 * h c B.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

B=2313 cm^-1 =231300 m^-1.

So E =2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 231300: 1.9878e-25 *2.313e5 = approx 4.6e-20.

Multiply by 2: 9.2e-20 J.

Wait, that's much larger than earlier calculation. So E=9.2e-20 J. Then p = E/c = 9.2e-20 /3e8 =3.07e-28 N s.

Which is approximately 3.1e-28 N s. So the closest option would be A)1.9e-28 or D)1.4e-28. Hmm, no.

Wait, but earlier when I computed B in cm^-1, I think I may have made a mistake in the formula for B.

The correct formula for the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers is B = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, let's compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *3e8 *1.207e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8=2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.207e-46=2.861e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.861e-36 = approx 2313 cm^-1. Correct.

So energy for r=1 is E=2 * h c B = 2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *2313 cm^-1.

Wait, 2313 cm^-1 is 231300 m^-1.

So E=2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *231300=4.6e-20.

Multiply by 2:9.2e-20 J.

p=9.2e-20 /3e8=3.07e-28 N s.

So 3.07e-28 N s, which is 3.07e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but option D is 1.4e-28. Neither is very close. Hmm.

Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy isn't 2B but B.

Wait, no, E_rot for r=1 is 2B (since E_r = B r(r+1), so r=1 gives 2B).

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, but I can't see why the numbers don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me check again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. μ = (20 *2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.818 amu.

Yes. So I think I did everything correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next possible state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require more energy, which again doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the momentum imparted to the molecule, not the photon. But no, the question clearly states the photon's momentum.

I'm really stuck here. My calculations point towards a photon momentum of about 3e-28 N s for the rotational transition, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the vibrational transition gives about 8.83e-28 N s, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, r=0) to the first state with higher rotational and vibrational energy. But that's a higher energy transition, which again doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model requires the photon to cause a transition in both vibration and rotation. But that would be a combination, and I'm not sure about the energy levels for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=1, r=0), which requires the vibrational energy, giving E= h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 N s. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as the product of the two masses, but that's incorrect because the reduced mass should be used.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass μ is actually (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) in kg. Let me compute that again.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ= (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 ) = (1.102e-52) / (3.653e-26) )= approx 3.018e-27 kg. Which matches earlier calculation.

So I think all my calculations are correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 N s, which is about 1/4 of my calculated value. But I can't see where I would have missed a factor of 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rotational energy is B r(r+1) in Joules, but I should have used K = B r(r+1), where K is in terms of energy per molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the moment of inertia with Mx and My as separate masses, not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

If I compute I as Mx * R² + My * R² = (Mx + My) R².

So I = (20 +2) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

(22 amu) *4e-20 m².

22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.6531e-26 kg.

I=3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg m².

Then B= ħ²/(2 I)= (1.112e-68)/(2 *1.4612e-45)=1.112e-68/(2.9224e-45)= approx 3.805e-24 J.

Then 2B=7.61e-24 J.

p=7.61e-24 /3e8=2.537e-31 N s.

Still way off.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first state where either rotation or vibration changes, whichever requires the least energy, which is rotation. So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 N s, but no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor and ignores the vibrational part, in which case the transition would be the first rotational state. But even then, the calculation doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=0, r=1), which requires 2B, but using a different value for B.

Wait, perhaps B is given by (h^2)/(8 M R²), where M is the reduced mass.

Wait, no, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I) = (h²)/(8 I), because ħ= h/(2 pi).

So B= (h²)/(8 I).

Hmm, let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

So h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

8 I=8 *1.207e-46=9.656e-46 kg m².

B=4.39e-67 /9.656e-46 ≈4.54e-22 J.

So 2B=9.08e-22 J. Then p=9.08e-22 /3e8=3.027e-30 N s.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the vibrational transition. The only option close to that is option A and D. Let me compute 8.83e-28 and see which option is closest.

Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of my calculated value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is actually the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (cm^-1), not angular frequency. If that's the case, then E=h c w.

Wait, the problem states w is 4e14 rad/s. But if it were wavenumber, the units would be cm^-1, but the question says rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in terms of the vibrational frequency, but I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition.

So E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 N s.

Not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look at the options again and see which one could be derived from the given data.

Option C:1.1e-27 N s.

Let me compute what energy that would correspond to.

p = E/c => E= p c.

So E=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which would require h w=3.3e-19 J.

w=3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈5e14 rad/s.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s, so this doesn't fit.

Option B:2.3e-27 N s.

E=2.3e-27 *3e8=6.9e-19 J.

h w=6.9e-19 =>w=6.9e-19 /6.626e-34≈1.04e15 rad/s. Not matching.

Option D:1.4e-28 N s.

E=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J.

h w=4.2e-20 =>w=4.2e-20 /6.626e-34≈6.33e13 rad/s. Not matching 4e14.

Option A:1.9e-28 N s.

E=1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

h w=5.7e-20 =>w=5.7e-20 /6.626e-34≈8.6e13 rad/s. Not matching.

Hmm. None of the options match the given w=4e14 rad/s for the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the first state where both vibrational and rotational states increase by one. So, the energy would be E = h w + 2B.

But that would be much higher, and the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between two rotational states.

Wait, but the question specifies the molecule is in the fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after (v=0, r=0) is the one with the least energy, which is (v=0, r=1). So the corresponding photon energy is 2B.

But my calculation for that leads to p=3e-31 N s, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state with the same rotational state, i.e., v=1, r=0. So E=h w=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 N s. But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon's momentum based on the reduced mass and bond length for the vibrational transition.

Wait, another approach: the vibrational energy is quantized with energy levels E_vib = (n +1/2) h w.

The transition from n=0 to n=1 requires ΔE= h w.

So E_photon= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E_photon/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the given data is in different units. Let me check R.

Ah! Wait a second. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. But perhaps I should have used 2 angstroms as 2e-8 cm, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is in atomic mass units. Oh no, I converted it to kg correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes centrifugal distortion. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats the molecule as a harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation, but the energy levels are combined. But that doesn't change the individual energy contributions.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 N s, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, I'll try one last calculation for B.

B= ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.207e-46)

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46=2.414e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 /2.414e-46=4.6e-23 J.

2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 N s.

Hmm. I think I've tried everything and can't find a match. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C or option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition but in terms of the moment of inertia being Mx * My * R², not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

I = Mx * My * R².

Mx=20 amu =3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

I=3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, no, I is μ R², not Mx My R².

Hmm. I'm stuck and time is up. Based on the calculations, the correct momentum for the rotational transition is 3e-31 N s, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake and the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 N s.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is given by \( I = \mu R^2 \):  
   \[
   I = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \text{where } \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for transitioning from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.6 \times 10^{-23} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]  
   This value is significantly smaller than any of the provided options.

6. **Vibrational Transition Consideration**:  
   The energy difference for transitioning from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) in vibration is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]  
   This value also does not match any of the provided options.

7. **Final Consideration**:  
   After extensive calculations and verifying all steps, the derived momentum values for both rotational and vibrational transitions do not match the provided options. However, based on the closest match to the calculations, **Option C: \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies in the numerical values.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The elements are X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model... I remember that for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational states are quantized. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state with the lowest energy. But wait, what's the next state? Like, does it increase the vibrational state or the rotational state?

I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state would be the first excited state, but I'm not sure if it's a change in rotation, vibration, or a combination of both.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right! That's the first excited state. So the photon must cause the molecule to transition to the next energy level, which could involve either increasing the vibrational state or the rotational state. But which transition requires less energy?

Vibrational energy levels are quantized with much higher spacing than rotational ones. So the energy difference between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational. So to get the lowest possible photon energy (and thus the smallest momentum, since p = h/λ and E=pc for photons), the photon should cause a transition to the next rotational state, not vibration.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The fundamental state is the ground state of both rotation and vibration. So the next state could be either increasing the vibrational quantum number by one (v=1) or the rotational (r=1). The energy difference for vibration is much larger than for rotation. So if the photon provides the minimal energy, maybe it's the rotational transition.

But the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, maybe the energy levels are treated as a combination of both. Hmm. Or perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor with quantized vibrational states?

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model might include both rotation and vibration. Let me think about the energy levels again. The energy for a diatomic molecule can be split into vibrational and rotational parts. The total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

In the rigid rotor approximation, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B r (r+1), where r is the rotational quantum number and B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (n + 1/2), where n is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, no. Actually, the harmonic oscillator model for vibrations gives E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, and the rotational energy is E_rot = B r (r +1). So the fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (r=0). The next state would have either r=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). Which requires less energy change?

The energy difference for vibration is h w. For rotation, the change when r goes from 0 to 1 is E_rot = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

But wait, what is B? The rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I = μ R², with μ being the reduced mass and R the bond length.

So let's compute B. First, I need to find μ, the reduced mass.

Masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) amu. 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ Let me do 1.8 *1.66 = 2.988. So about 3e-27 kg? Wait, precise calculation: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

Compute 1.818 *1.6605: Let's do 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, and 0.018 *1.6605≈0.0299. So total approx 2.9889 +0.0299=3.0188. So 3.0188e-27 kg.

Then I = μ R². R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

I = (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now B = ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h-bar, 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2075e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Now the energy difference for rotation from r=0 to r=1 is 2B.

2B = 9.2e-23 J.

For vibration, the energy difference from n=0 to n=1 is h w. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, that's way larger than 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon would cause a transition to the next rotational state, which is r=1, but wait, can we have that?

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state for both rotation and vibration. So the next state would be either r=1 (v=0) or n=1 (r=0). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the one that would be taken by a photon with lower energy. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference for the rotational transition from r=0 to r=1.

Wait, but wait, maybe the model is such that the energy levels are a combination of both. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the fundamental state is (n=0, r=0). The next state could be either (n=1, r=0) or (n=0, r=1). Which transition requires less energy? Well, the vibrational transition requires h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, but the rotational requires 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J. The latter is much smaller.

So the photon's energy should be equal to the rotational energy difference, so the molecule goes from (r=0) to (r=1), and remains in the same vibrational state.

Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one that's the next in energy order, regardless of which mode it's in. So the transition with the smallest energy difference would be the rotational one. So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. The vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than the rotational. So transition from n=0 to n=1 requires 2.65e-19 J, whereas transition from r=0 to r=1 requires 9.2e-23 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the photon with the lower energy is needed for the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because momentum p of a photon is p = E/c. Because for a photon, E = pc.

So E = 9.2e-23 J. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23)/(3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute that:

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2/3) * 1e-31 = approximately 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.066e-31 kg·m/s. But wait, looking at the options, the units are N·s. Wait, 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So 3.066e-31 kg·m/s is 3.066e-31 N·s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N*s

B) 2.3e-27 N*s

C) 1.1e-27 N*s

D) 1.4e-28 N*s

Hmm. My calculation gives about 3e-31 N*s, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recalculate.

Calculating μ again. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute 1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889; 0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.02996. So total is 2.9889 + 0.02996 ≈ 3.01886e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.01886e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01886e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20754e-46 kg·m².

B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.20754e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.415e-46) = let's compute 1.112 / 2.415 ≈ 0.46.

So 0.46e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait. 2.415e-46 is denominator: 1.112e-68 / 2.415e-46 = (1.112 / 2.415) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 * 1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J. So B is 4.6e-23 J.

Then 2B is 9.2e-23 J. So the energy of the photon is 9.2e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.066e-31 N·s.

Looking at the options, none match. So did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I confused the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy levels are E = B r (r+1). So the transition from r=0 (E=0) to r=1 (E=2B) requires ΔE=2B.

But perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which would have a much larger photon energy. Because if you have a photon with higher energy, like the vibrational transition, the options are in the 1e-27 or 1e-28 range.

Wait, let me compute the photon momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg·m/s = 8.8347e-28 N·s.

Hmm, that's 8.83e-28 N·s. Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28), but not exactly.

Wait, but perhaps the transition isn't just a single quantum in vibration, but maybe a combination of both rotation and vibration. Oh, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon should cause the minimal energy transition. So that's the rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, that would be 3e-31 N·s, which isn't any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the molecule's vibrational energy as part of the state, and the transition is a combination. Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the fundamental vibration plus rotation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecular energy levels are considered with both vibrational and rotational contributions. The fundamental state is (v=0, r=0). The next state is (v=0, r=1), which is the next higher energy state.

So the energy required is the rotational transition.

But why is my calculation not matching the options? Let me check the numbers another way.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for B is incorrect.

Let me double-check the calculation of B. B is ħ²/(2 I).

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.207e-46) ) = (1.112e-68)/(2.414e-46) = (1.112 /2.414) * 1e-22 = approx 0.46 *1e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J. Then p = E/c = (9.2e-23)/(3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the first excited vibrational state. Let's compute that.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 N s. The options given are A) 1.9e-28, D) 1.4e-28, etc.

So neither 3e-31 nor 8.8e-28 match the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in the context of the molecule's center of mass motion. Or maybe it's about the change in momentum of the molecule.

Wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels also include both rotation and vibration. But the fundamental state is the lowest in both, and the next state is the first excited in either.

But why is the calculated momentum not matching any options?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me double-check.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I'm using the wrong unit conversion? 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters? Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's momentum is not E/c, but something else. Wait, no, the momentum of a photon is p = E/c.

Wait, perhaps I should be using relativistic considerations? No, for photon, E=pc holds exactly.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the transition to be the first vibrational state, but I miscalculated the energy.

Wait, let me compute h w again. h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg·m/s, which is 8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options are near this. So perhaps the model expects something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition but I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me recompute B.

μ = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.018e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R^2 = 3.018e-27 * (2e-10)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20. So I=3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, is this correct? Because 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, so 1.112e-68 /2.414e-46 is about (1.112/2.414)*1e-22 ≈ 0.46e-22=4.6e-23 J.

Yes.

So 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the model expects the energy to be the sum of both rotation and vibration. Or maybe the problem is about the transition to the next state, which could be a combination, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between the first rotational and the first vibrational state. But that seems more complicated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0), and the first excited rotational state (r=1). The energy for that is E_rot= 2B.

But when it absorbs a photon, it could transition to n=1 and r=0, which has E_vib= h w, or to r=1 with E_rot=2B.

The photon's energy should match the lower of the two, so the rotational transition.

But again, the calculated p is way smaller than the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor model, where the rotational energy is quantized, but treating the vibrational energy as an adjustment. Or perhaps I need to calculate the vibrational energy difference for the fundamental state.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the rotational energy but the vibrational. Let me see the options again.

Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of 1e-27. Hmm.

Wait, let me calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

The closest option is D:1.4e-28. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4=26.504, but 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20. So 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J. Correct.

So 2.65e-19 J/c. c is 3e8 m/s.

So 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

Wait, the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the rotational transition but I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia I is μ R², which I have, but perhaps B is in cm-1 instead of Joules. Because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in wavenumbers. Hmm.

Wait, what's the rotational constant B in terms of cm-1?

B (in cm-1) is (h/(8 π² c I)) ), or maybe another formula. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute B in terms of energy per molecule.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational constant in terms of frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E = B r(r+1), where B is the rotational constant in Joules.

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, which is the wavenumber.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me consider another approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, r=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, r=0). So the energy change is h w.

Thus, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is E/c = h w /c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. Momentum p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in something else.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu +2 amu) =40/(22) amu = 1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as R=2 angstroms, but in the calculation, I used 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the way I calculated the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: rotational constant B is given by (h/(8 π² I c)) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are E = (r + 1/2) h c B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of energy.

Wait, I think I did it right earlier. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects the rotational transition to require an energy of h c B, where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1. Wait, maybe I should compute B in cm^-1.

Wait, the rotational constant B in cm^-1 is given by B = h/(8 π² c I) ), where I is the moment of inertia in kg m².

Wait, let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s, I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 *pi^2 *3e8 *1.207e-46 )

Calculate denominator: 8 * (9.8696) [since pi^2≈9.8696] *3e8 *1.207e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.207e-46 =2.861e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 / 2.861e-36 ≈2313 cm^-1.

Hmm, 2313 cm^-1. So the energy difference when r changes from 0 to 1 is 2B, which in cm^-1 is 4626 cm^-1.

But converting that to energy: E = h c B, where B is in cm^-1. So E =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2313.

=6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25; *2313= approx 1.9878e-25 *2.313e3≈4.6e-22 J.

Wait, that's close to 4.6e-23 J. Wait, earlier calculation was 2B=9.2e-23 J, which is about 4.6e-23 *2.

Hmm, but I'm getting confused again. Perhaps I should find the energy in Joules using this method.

Wait, the rotational energy transition from r=0 to r=1 is 2B, where B is the rotational constant in J.

Earlier calculation gave B=4.6e-23 J, so 2B=9.2e-23 J. Then p =9.2e-23 /3e8=3e-31 N s.

But again, this isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the way the rotational energy is considered. The energy levels are E_r = B r(r+1), but the spacing between r and r+1 is not just 2B, but the difference between (r+1)(r+2)B and r(r+1)B.

Which is [ (r+1)(r+2) - r(r+1) ] B = (r+1)(2) B. So for r=0, the difference is 2B. For r=1, it's 4B, etc.

So for r=0 to r=1, it's 2B. So that part was correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck because my calculations don't match the options. Perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, not rotational, and I should recheck that.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E = h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question expects the photon's energy to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions. That is, the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=1, r=1).

But that complicates things, and the energy would be higher than both.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition within the rotation-vibration model where the next state is the first vibrationally excited state with the same rotational state. So E = h w. But that gives a p of 8.8e-28, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me check that.

Mass X is 20 amu, mass Y is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22 =1.81818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Hmm. I'm not seeing where the mistake is. Let me think about the options again. The option closest to 8.8e-28 is option A:1.9e-28 and D:1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between the first rotational and the first vibrational state, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing frequency with wavenumber. The given w is angular frequency (ω), but sometimes people use wavenumbers (cm^-1) which are related to frequency by c= speed of light.

Wait, the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 is h w. So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=8.83e-28 N s.

None of the options match. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the momentum of the molecule, not the photon. Wait, no, the question says the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor? Let me think about the units.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. So E = h f = h c / λ.

Photon momentum p = E/c = (h f)/c = h/(lambda c) [No, that's not right. p = h/(lambda), since p = E/c and E= h f = h c /lambda. So p= h/(lambda)= h f/c.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: compute the energy in terms of the rotational transition and see if any option matches.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is in terms of the wavenumber. Let me compute B in wavenumbers again.

Earlier, I found B in cm^-1 to be approximately 2313 cm^-1. So the energy in Joules is E = h c B.

h =6.626e-34 J s, c=3e8 m/s, B=2313 cm^-1=231300 m^-1.

So E =6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 231300: 1.9878e-25 *2.313e5 ≈ 4.6e-20 J.

Wait, that's 4.6e-20 J. p=4.6e-20 /3e8=1.53e-28 N s.

Hmm, that's close to option D:1.4e-28.

Wait, yes! 1.53e-28 is approximately 1.5e-28, which is close to option D:1.4e-28.

But wait, why did this approach give a different result?

Ah, because earlier when I calculated B in Joules, I got B=4.6e-23 J. That would mean E_rot = 2B =9.2e-23 J. But when I calculated B in cm^-1, I found E_rot =4.6e-20 J.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in one of the calculations.

Wait, let's clarify: B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant, which when multiplied by h c gives the energy in J.

So if B =2313 cm^-1, E_rot for r=1 is E= (1)(2) * h c B.

Wait, no, E_rot = B r(r+1). So for r=1, E=2 B. So E=2 * h c B.

Wait, no, B in cm^-1 is the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers. So the energy levels are E_r = r(r+1) * h c B.

So when r=0, E=0. When r=1, E=2 h c B.

So the energy difference between r=0 and r=1 is 2 h c B.

So with B=2313 cm^-1,

E = 2 * h c B.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

B=2313 cm^-1 =231300 m^-1.

So E =2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 231300: 1.9878e-25 *2.313e5 = approx 4.6e-20.

Multiply by 2: 9.2e-20 J.

Wait, that's much larger than earlier calculation. So E=9.2e-20 J. Then p = E/c = 9.2e-20 /3e8 =3.07e-28 N s.

Which is approximately 3.1e-28 N s. So the closest option would be A)1.9e-28 or D)1.4e-28. Hmm, no.

Wait, but earlier when I computed B in cm^-1, I think I may have made a mistake in the formula for B.

The correct formula for the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers is B = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, let's compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi^2 *3e8 *1.207e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8=2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.207e-46=2.861e-36.

So B=6.626e-34 /2.861e-36 = approx 2313 cm^-1. Correct.

So energy for r=1 is E=2 * h c B = 2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *2313 cm^-1.

Wait, 2313 cm^-1 is 231300 m^-1.

So E=2 *6.626e-34 *3e8 *231300.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *231300=4.6e-20.

Multiply by 2:9.2e-20 J.

p=9.2e-20 /3e8=3.07e-28 N s.

So 3.07e-28 N s, which is 3.07e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but option D is 1.4e-28. Neither is very close. Hmm.

Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy isn't 2B but B.

Wait, no, E_rot for r=1 is 2B (since E_r = B r(r+1), so r=1 gives 2B).

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, but I can't see why the numbers don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me check again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. μ = (20 *2)/(20+2)=40/22=1.818 amu.

Yes. So I think I did everything correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next possible state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require more energy, which again doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the momentum imparted to the molecule, not the photon. But no, the question clearly states the photon's momentum.

I'm really stuck here. My calculations point towards a photon momentum of about 3e-28 N s for the rotational transition, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the vibrational transition gives about 8.83e-28 N s, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, r=0) to the first state with higher rotational and vibrational energy. But that's a higher energy transition, which again doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model requires the photon to cause a transition in both vibration and rotation. But that would be a combination, and I'm not sure about the energy levels for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=1, r=0), which requires the vibrational energy, giving E= h w=2.65e-19 J, p=8.83e-28 N s. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as the product of the two masses, but that's incorrect because the reduced mass should be used.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass μ is actually (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) in kg. Let me compute that again.

Mx=20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

μ= (3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 +3.321e-27 ) = (1.102e-52) / (3.653e-26) )= approx 3.018e-27 kg. Which matches earlier calculation.

So I think all my calculations are correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 N s, which is about 1/4 of my calculated value. But I can't see where I would have missed a factor of 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rotational energy is B r(r+1) in Joules, but I should have used K = B r(r+1), where K is in terms of energy per molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the moment of inertia with Mx and My as separate masses, not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

If I compute I as Mx * R² + My * R² = (Mx + My) R².

So I = (20 +2) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

(22 amu) *4e-20 m².

22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.6531e-26 kg.

I=3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg m².

Then B= ħ²/(2 I)= (1.112e-68)/(2 *1.4612e-45)=1.112e-68/(2.9224e-45)= approx 3.805e-24 J.

Then 2B=7.61e-24 J.

p=7.61e-24 /3e8=2.537e-31 N s.

Still way off.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first state where either rotation or vibration changes, whichever requires the least energy, which is rotation. So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 N s, but no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor and ignores the vibrational part, in which case the transition would be the first rotational state. But even then, the calculation doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, r=0) to (v=0, r=1), which requires 2B, but using a different value for B.

Wait, perhaps B is given by (h^2)/(8 M R²), where M is the reduced mass.

Wait, no, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I) = (h²)/(8 I), because ħ= h/(2 pi).

So B= (h²)/(8 I).

Hmm, let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

So h²=4.39e-67 J² s².

8 I=8 *1.207e-46=9.656e-46 kg m².

B=4.39e-67 /9.656e-46 ≈4.54e-22 J.

So 2B=9.08e-22 J. Then p=9.08e-22 /3e8=3.027e-30 N s.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the vibrational transition. The only option close to that is option A and D. Let me compute 8.83e-28 and see which option is closest.

Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 1/5 of my calculated value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is actually the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (cm^-1), not angular frequency. If that's the case, then E=h c w.

Wait, the problem states w is 4e14 rad/s. But if it were wavenumber, the units would be cm^-1, but the question says rad/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is in terms of the vibrational frequency, but I'm supposed to compute the photon's momentum based on the vibrational transition.

So E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 N s.

Not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should look at the options again and see which one could be derived from the given data.

Option C:1.1e-27 N s.

Let me compute what energy that would correspond to.

p = E/c => E= p c.

So E=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which would require h w=3.3e-19 J.

w=3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈5e14 rad/s.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s, so this doesn't fit.

Option B:2.3e-27 N s.

E=2.3e-27 *3e8=6.9e-19 J.

h w=6.9e-19 =>w=6.9e-19 /6.626e-34≈1.04e15 rad/s. Not matching.

Option D:1.4e-28 N s.

E=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J.

h w=4.2e-20 =>w=4.2e-20 /6.626e-34≈6.33e13 rad/s. Not matching 4e14.

Option A:1.9e-28 N s.

E=1.9e-28 *3e8=5.7e-20 J.

h w=5.7e-20 =>w=5.7e-20 /6.626e-34≈8.6e13 rad/s. Not matching.

Hmm. None of the options match the given w=4e14 rad/s for the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the first state where both vibrational and rotational states increase by one. So, the energy would be E = h w + 2B.

But that would be much higher, and the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is the difference between two rotational states.

Wait, but the question specifies the molecule is in the fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after (v=0, r=0) is the one with the least energy, which is (v=0, r=1). So the corresponding photon energy is 2B.

But my calculation for that leads to p=3e-31 N s, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state with the same rotational state, i.e., v=1, r=0. So E=h w=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 N s. But that doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the photon's momentum based on the reduced mass and bond length for the vibrational transition.

Wait, another approach: the vibrational energy is quantized with energy levels E_vib = (n +1/2) h w.

The transition from n=0 to n=1 requires ΔE= h w.

So E_photon= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E_photon/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the given data is in different units. Let me check R.

Ah! Wait a second. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. But perhaps I should have used 2 angstroms as 2e-8 cm, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is in atomic mass units. Oh no, I converted it to kg correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes centrifugal distortion. But I'm not sure how that would change the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the model treats the molecule as a harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation, but the energy levels are combined. But that doesn't change the individual energy contributions.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 N s, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, I'll try one last calculation for B.

B= ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.207e-46)

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46=2.414e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 /2.414e-46=4.6e-23 J.

2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 N s.

Hmm. I think I've tried everything and can't find a match. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C or option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition but in terms of the moment of inertia being Mx * My * R², not the reduced mass. Let me try that.

I = Mx * My * R².

Mx=20 amu =3.321e-26 kg.

My=2 amu=3.321e-27 kg.

I=3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, no, I is μ R², not Mx My R².

Hmm. I'm stuck and time is up. Based on the calculations, the correct momentum for the rotational transition is 3e-31 N s, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake and the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 N s.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reduced Mass Calculation**:  
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms:  
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is given by \( I = \mu R^2 \):  
   \[
   I = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant \( B \)**:  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \text{where } \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for transitioning from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.6 \times 10^{-23} = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]  
   This value is significantly smaller than any of the provided options.

6. **Vibrational Transition Consideration**:  
   The energy difference for transitioning from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \) in vibration is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]  
   This value also does not match any of the provided options.

7. **Final Consideration**:  
   After extensive calculations and verifying all steps, the derived momentum values for both rotational and vibrational transitions do not match the provided options. However, based on the closest match to the calculations, **Option C: \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies in the numerical values.
