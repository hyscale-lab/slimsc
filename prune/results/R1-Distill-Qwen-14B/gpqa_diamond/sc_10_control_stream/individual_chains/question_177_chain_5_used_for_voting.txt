Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times larger, but I'm not sure if mass plays a role here. The question is about their luminosities. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're told to assume they radiate as black bodies, and compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R² T⁴. So, if I can find the temperature ratio, I can find the luminosity ratio.

Wait, but the problem mentions the radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. The brightest wavelength (the peak emission) for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). 

So, if both stars appear to have the same observed wavelength (λ_obs), but their actual temperatures might be different due to their velocities. Because one is moving towards or away from us, which shifts the wavelength.

Wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, is that moving towards or away? Well, the problem states the radial velocity as 700, but I think the direction isn't specified. Hmm. Radial velocity could be either, but the Doppler effect formula depends on the direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength will be shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift).

But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star_1 is at rest relative to us, λ1 = λ_max1. Star_2, when moving, has λ2_obs = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ), assuming v is positive if moving away. Wait, but I might have the formula a bit off. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving away, where v is positive if moving away. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c), but I'm not sure which formula to apply here. However, 700 km/s is 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), which is about 0.233% of the speed of light. So, the non-relativistic approximation might be acceptable, but perhaps the exact formula is better.

Wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So, λ1 = λ2_obs.

Star_1 has λ1 = b / T1. Because it's not moving, the observed wavelength is the emitted one.

Star_2 emits at λ2 = b / T2. But due to its radial velocity, the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * Doppler factor. Wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )? Or wait, no, the Doppler formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. Alternatively, if v is positive when moving away, then λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of frequency. The Doppler effect for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) if moving away, where beta is v/c. Or wait, no, when moving away, the frequency decreases, so f_obs = f_rest * ( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^(1/2) ). Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, f_obs ≈ f_rest (1 - v/c). But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of wavelengths.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength. The formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ), where beta = v/c, if the source is moving away from the observer. If it's moving towards, then it's sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), which would make the observed wavelength shorter.

In this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. I think radial velocity is typically positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So, its observed wavelength would be longer than its emitted wavelength.

But wait, both stars have the same observed wavelength. So, for Star_1, λ1 = b / T1 is the observed wavelength. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2 * Doppler factor, but wait, the emitted wavelength is λ2_emit = b / T2, and the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c. Since Star_2 is moving away, beta is positive.

So, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

We can cancel b, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Let me solve for T2 in terms of T1, or vice versa.

We can rearrange:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, let's see:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, wait. Because if T2 is the star's actual temperature, but because it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, the observed λ is longer than the emitted. So, the star's emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed? Wait, no. Because if the star is moving away, the light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer. So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ). But λ1 is the observed wavelength for Star_1, which is λ1_emit, since Star_1 is stationary. So, since λ1 = λ2_obs, we can write:

λ1 = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that would imply that T2 is higher than T1, because (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) is greater than 1, so sqrt of that is greater than 1, so T2 is larger than T1. But that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. Wait, but the problem says Star_1 has a larger radius, so if Star_2 is hotter, then perhaps Star_1 is cooler but larger, which affects the luminosity.

Wait, but let's compute beta. beta is v/c.

v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so beta = 700 / (3e5) ≈ 0.0023333.

So let's compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333) ≈ (1.0023333)/(0.9976667). Let me compute that.

1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.00467 approx.

So sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So, T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

But that's a very small factor. Hmm, but let's proceed.

Now, since luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

So, (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1 / T2)^4.

From above, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is approximately sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, because sqrt(0.995366) is approximately 0.99768.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. 0.99768^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99536. Then, square that again: 0.99536^2 ≈ 0.99073.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99073.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99073) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, that's about 2.23, which is one of the options. Let me check the options.

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So, 2.227 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler factor.

Wait, I had Star_2 moving away with velocity v. So, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c.

But in this case, Star_2's observed wavelength equals Star_1's, which is λ1 = λ2_obs.

But Star_1's λ is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2's emitted λ is λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Dividing both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that makes T2 larger than T1. So, T2 is hotter. But since R1 is larger than R2, but T1 is smaller than T2, what does that mean for luminosity?

L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

So,

= ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (1.5)^2 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

We have T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / [ sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ] = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ) = sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 is approximately (0.99768)^4 ≈ (approx 0.99768)^2 = ~0.99536, squared again is ~0.9907. So, 0.9907.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227, which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but what if the radial velocity is towards us? Then we would have a blueshift. Let's think about that for a moment. If Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but towards us, then v is negative. So, beta is -0.002333. Then,

(1 + beta) = 1 - 0.002333 = 0.9976667,

(1 - beta) = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.0023333.

So,

sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt(0.9976667 / 1.0023333) ≈ sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, same result? Because (1+beta)/(1-beta) would be (0.997667)/(1.002333) = 0.995366. So the square root is same. So whether it's moving towards or away, the ratio would be same?

Wait, no, because the observed wavelength would be different. If moving towards, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than lambda_emit. So in that case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than λ2_emit.

But in our problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So,

λ1 = λ2_obs.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

λ1 = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which would mean:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which leads to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Same expression as before. So regardless of whether it's moving towards or away, the expression for T2 in terms of T1 is the same, because beta is taken as positive in the formula. So the calculation remains the same.

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the relationship for luminosity of a black body: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{obs}} \)). Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the emitted wavelengths are:

\[
\lambda_1^{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T_1}, \quad \lambda_2^{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T_2}
\]

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is affected by its radial velocity (\( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)) due to the relativistic Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_2^{\text{obs}} = \lambda_2^{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{obs}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Canceling \( b \) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx \sqrt{1.00467} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The radii of the stars are given as \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}} \approx 0.99768 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \times (0.99768)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Then, calculate \( (0.99768)^4 \):

\[
(0.99768)^2 \approx 0.99536, \quad (0.99536)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.

Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Wait, but the problem mentions the radial velocities. Oh, right, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. The brightest wavelength (the peak emission) for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). 

So, if both stars appear to have the same observed wavelength (λ_obs), but their actual temperatures might be different due to their velocities. Because one is moving towards or away from us, which shifts the wavelength.

Wait, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, is that moving towards or away? Well, the problem states the radial velocity as 700, but I think the direction isn't specified. Hmm. Radial velocity could be either, but the Doppler effect formula depends on the direction. If Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength will be shorter (blue shift), and if moving away, longer (red shift).

But in the problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So, if Star_1 is at rest relative to us, λ1 = λ_max1. Star_2, when moving, has λ2_obs = λ_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ), assuming v is positive if moving away. Wait, but I might have the formula a bit off. Let me recall. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving away, where v is positive if moving away. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c), but I'm not sure which formula to apply here. However, 700 km/s is 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s), which is about 0.233% of the speed of light. So, the non-relativistic approximation might be acceptable, but perhaps the exact formula is better.

Wait, the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So, λ1 = λ2_obs.

Star_1 has λ1 = b / T1. Because it's not moving, the observed wavelength is the emitted one.

Star_2 emits at λ2 = b / T2. But due to its radial velocity, the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2 * Doppler factor. Wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )? Or wait, no, the Doppler formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving away. Alternatively, if v is positive when moving away, then λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of frequency. The Doppler effect for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) if moving away, where beta is v/c. Or wait, no, when moving away, the frequency decreases, so f_obs = f_rest * ( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^(1/2) ). Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, f_obs ≈ f_rest (1 - v/c). But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of wavelengths.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength. The formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ), where beta = v/c, if the source is moving away from the observer. If it's moving towards, then it's sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), which would make the observed wavelength shorter.

In this problem, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. I think radial velocity is typically positive when moving away. So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So, its observed wavelength would be longer than its emitted wavelength.

But wait, both stars have the same observed wavelength. So, for Star_1, λ1 = b / T1 is the observed wavelength. For Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2 * Doppler factor, but wait, the emitted wavelength is λ2_emit = b / T2, and the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c. Since Star_2 is moving away, beta is positive.

So, λ1 = λ2_obs.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

We can cancel b, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Let me solve for T2 in terms of T1, or vice versa.

We can rearrange:

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, let's see:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = sqrt( (1+beta)/(1-beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, wait. Because if T2 is the star's actual temperature, but because it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So, the observed λ is longer than the emitted. So, the star's emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed? Wait, no. Because if the star is moving away, the light is redshifted, so the observed wavelength is longer. So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ). But λ1 is the observed wavelength for Star_1, which is λ1_emit, since Star_1 is stationary. So, since λ1 = λ2_obs, we can write:

λ1 = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But λ1 = b / T1 and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that would imply that T2 is higher than T1, because (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) is greater than 1, so sqrt of that is greater than 1, so T2 is larger than T1. But that would mean Star_2 is hotter than Star_1. Wait, but the problem says Star_1 has a larger radius, so if Star_2 is hotter, then perhaps Star_1 is cooler but larger, which affects the luminosity.

Wait, but let's compute beta. beta is v/c.

v for Star_2 is 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so beta = 700 / (3e5) ≈ 0.0023333.

So let's compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1 + 0.0023333)/(1 - 0.0023333) ≈ (1.0023333)/(0.9976667). Let me compute that.

1.0023333 / 0.9976667 ≈ 1.00467 approx.

So sqrt(1.00467) ≈ 1.00233.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So, T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

But that's a very small factor. Hmm, but let's proceed.

Now, since luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

So, (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1 / T2)^4.

From above, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is approximately sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ) ≈ sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, because sqrt(0.995366) is approximately 0.99768.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute that. 0.99768^2 is approximately (1 - 0.00232)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00464 + (0.00232)^2 ≈ 0.99536. Then, square that again: 0.99536^2 ≈ 0.99073.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99073.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99073) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, that's about 2.23, which is one of the options. Let me check the options.

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

So, 2.227 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler factor.

Wait, I had Star_2 moving away with velocity v. So, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c.

But in this case, Star_2's observed wavelength equals Star_1's, which is λ1 = λ2_obs.

But Star_1's λ is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2's emitted λ is λ2_emit = b / T2.

So,

λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Dividing both sides by b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that makes T2 larger than T1. So, T2 is hotter. But since R1 is larger than R2, but T1 is smaller than T2, what does that mean for luminosity?

L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

So,

= ( (1.5 R2 / R2 )^2 ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (1.5)^2 * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

= 2.25 * ( (T1 / T2 )^4 )

We have T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / [ sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ] = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which is sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) ) ≈ sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ) = sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

So, (T1/T2)^4 is approximately (0.99768)^4 ≈ (approx 0.99768)^2 = ~0.99536, squared again is ~0.9907. So, 0.9907.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227, which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but what if the radial velocity is towards us? Then we would have a blueshift. Let's think about that for a moment. If Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but towards us, then v is negative. So, beta is -0.002333. Then,

(1 + beta) = 1 - 0.002333 = 0.9976667,

(1 - beta) = 1 + 0.002333 = 1.0023333.

So,

sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt(0.9976667 / 1.0023333) ≈ sqrt(0.995366) ≈ 0.99768.

Wait, same result? Because (1+beta)/(1-beta) would be (0.997667)/(1.002333) = 0.995366. So the square root is same. So whether it's moving towards or away, the ratio would be same?

Wait, no, because the observed wavelength would be different. If moving towards, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than lambda_emit. So in that case, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than λ2_emit.

But in our problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So,

λ1 = λ2_obs.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, then λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

λ1 = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which would mean:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which leads to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Same expression as before. So regardless of whether it's moving towards or away, the expression for T2 in terms of T1 is the same, because beta is taken as positive in the formula. So the calculation remains the same.

Therefore, the luminosity ratio is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the relationship for luminosity of a black body: 

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{obs}} \)). Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the emitted wavelengths are:

\[
\lambda_1^{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T_1}, \quad \lambda_2^{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T_2}
\]

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is affected by its radial velocity (\( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)) due to the relativistic Doppler effect. The observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_2^{\text{obs}} = \lambda_2^{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2^{\text{obs}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Canceling \( b \) and rearranging:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the Temperature Ratio
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx \sqrt{1.00467} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \times 1.00233
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The radii of the stars are given as \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Substituting the luminosity formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1)^2 (T_1)^4}{(R_2)^2 (T_2)^4}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \) and \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}} \approx 0.99768 \):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \times (0.99768)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Then, calculate \( (0.99768)^4 \):

\[
(0.99768)^2 \approx 0.99536, \quad (0.99536)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
