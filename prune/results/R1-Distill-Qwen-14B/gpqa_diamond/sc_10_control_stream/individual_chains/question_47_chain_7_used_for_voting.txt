Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify an organic compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's think about what that means. The molecular formula can help determine the possible functional groups and structure.

The IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. Oh wait, 3420 and 3325 are both in the range for N-H stretches, especially in amines or amides. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Because 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe an ester or possibly a ketone, but given the formula, more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, which suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet because the neighboring group has two protons (like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, ethyl is CH2CH3. Oh wait, the triplet in ethyl is usually at around 1.2-1.3 ppm as the CH3, with the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0 or something? Wait, no, I might be mixing that up. Wait, ethyl groups in NMR: the CH2 connected to the oxygen is usually around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2-1.4. So in this case, the 1.20 ppm is the CH3 of an ethyl group.

Then, 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like O or N. But a singlet, so no neighboring Hs. So perhaps a -OCH2- group, but in what context? Or maybe an ethyl group where the CH2 is attached to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, which is four peaks. 2H. Quartet suggests neighboring three Hs. Wait, but 2H as quartet... So that might be a CH2 connected to another CH2 group. Like in an ester, where the OCH2CH3 is split. Oh wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is more likely the CH2 connected to the ester oxygen. Wait, for ethyl esters, the CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Hmm, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe if it's adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl or an amide group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent, leading to a doublet each. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but the two doublets could also mean two different substituents in the para positions, each with two protons. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzamide or similar.

Putting this together, the compound likely has a benzene ring with a substituent and an ethyl group. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. Benzene (6 C) plus substituents: the substituent would have 3 C (since 9-6 =3). Wait, but the substituent might have more if there's an ester or amide group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. If it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are OCH2CH3 and CONH2 at positions 3 and... Wait, but the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's see: benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (3 C) + CONH2 (2 C, O, N). Wait, OCH2CH3 is 3 C (O, CH2, CH3?), no. Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 carbons from the ethyl group. So benzamide is C7H7NO2 (C6H5CONH2). Adding an ethoxy substituent would add another O and two CH2 groups? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ethoxy and another group. Maybe the substituent is OCH2CH3 and another group on the benzene.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So substituent would be OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group (HCONR) attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with 4-OCH2CH3 and a formamide group (HCONH- attached to the benzene). But wait, that would make the formula something like C8H9NO3? Wait, let me check. Benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) + formamide (HCONH-) is another C, O, N. So total would be 6 + 2 + 1 (from formamide) + 1 (from NH?) Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate:

Formamide group is HCONR, where R is the aryl. So for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is O=C(NHPhOCH2CH3)H. So, the molecule would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (ethoxyphenyl) connected to HCONH-.

Hmm, the molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 1 (formamide's carbonyl C) + H's: Let's see, benzene has 5 H (if substituted at 4 position with OCH2CH3 and formamide). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula. The given formula is C9H11NO2.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C6H4OCH2CH3) plus HCONH- attached to the benzene.

So the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with HCONH- attached to the para position. So the formula would be:

Ph is C6H5, but in this case, since OCH2CH3 is attached to the benzene, the benzene has one substituent as OCH2CH3. Then, the formamide group (HCONH-) is attached to another position, perhaps para to OCH2CH3.

Wait, the molecular formula would be: C6 (benzene) + OCH2CH3 (O, CH2, CH3) = 2 C from ethoxy, plus the formamide group, which is HCONH–, so that adds 1 C (the carbonyl C) and O and N. So total C: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9. O: from ethoxy (1 O), formamide has another O, so 2 O. N: 1 from formamide. So C9H? Let's see:

Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene (6 C) with OCH2CH3 (2 C, 5 H?), and HCONH–: that adds another H and N.

Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute:

Ph-OCH2CH3 is C6H5-OCH2CH3. Then, the formamide group is HCONH– attached to the benzene. So the entire molecule would be:

C6H4(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2)? Wait, no, because formamide is HCONHR, where R is the aryl group. So the structure would be O=C(NHPh-OCH2CH3)H. So the molecule is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 has 6 + 2 = 8 C; the formamide adds another C (the carbonyl C), so total 9 C. Now, H's: benzene ring has 4 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH– at para positions). OCH2CH3 contributes 2*2=4 H (OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 H and 3 CH3 H? Wait, OCH2CH3 is a substituent on the benzene, so it's OCH2CH3. The ethoxy group has 5 H: CH2CH3 has 2 H on CH2 and 3 on CH3. So ethoxy has 5 H. Then the formamide group: HCONH– would have how many H's? The H from HCO and the NH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula. Let's count each atom:

Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene ring is C6H5, but when connected to OCH2CH3, it would be C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the benzene has 4 H remaining (since two substituents). So the structure is:

C6H4(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2). Let me count:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (HCONH2) = 9 C.

O: O from ethoxy (1) + O from carbonyl (1) = 2 O.

N: 1 from HCONH2.

H: Benzene has 4 H. Ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3). Then, the HCONH2 has 1 (H) from HCO and 2 from NH2. So 4 +5 +1 +2 =12 H. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another approach: molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So the degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: likely a benzene ring (3), one double bond (carbonyl, 1), and another double bond elsewhere? Or maybe an amide group which has a double bond. So perhaps an amide group (CONH-) which is a double bond. So that would account for 3 (benzene) + 1 (amide) + 1 (carbonyl) = 5. So that makes sense.

So the compound likely has a benzene ring, an amide group, and an ester or ethoxy group.

Looking at the NMR again.

The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) suggests an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen. The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet) could be an OCH2 group. Wait, but where? If it's an ethyl ester, like OCH2CH3, then the CH2 would be around 4.1 as a quartet, and the CH3 around 1.2 as triplet.

Wait, but in our NMR data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's not the ethyl group attached to oxygen, but maybe something else.

Alternatively, the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be the CH2 connected to an oxygen, as in an ester. Let me think: in an ethyl ester, the CH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe because it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or an amide?

Looking at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. So the ester would be the OCH2CH3 group, and the amino group is at para position.

So NMR:

Ethyl ester group: The CH2 would be around 4.2 as quartet, CH3 as triplet around 1.2.

In the NMR data provided, the 4.5 is quartet for 2H. So perhaps it's a bit upfield, but maybe because of the amino group. Let's see.

The aromatic region: 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H). If the substituents are at para positions (like OCH2CH3 and NH2), then the ring would have two substituents. Wait, but wait, 4-aminobenzoate ester would have a substituent at 4 position (NH2) and 1 ester (COOEt) at another position? Or maybe the ester is attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure where the benzoate is at the para position to the amino group. So benzene with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets: the two ortho to COOEt would be at higher ppm (around 8.0) and the two para would be lower (7.0). Or wait, actually, the amino group is a strong deactivating group, so the ring would have certain shifts.

Wait, for para-substituted benzoate esters, the two H ortho to the ester would be more deshielded and appear around 7.5-8.0, and the two H meta would be around 7.0-7.5. But in this case, the substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para. So the substituents are in positions 1 and 4.

So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. Or wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the H in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H in positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the H's in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and H's in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But in this case, position 2 and 6 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. Position 3 and 5 are meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2.

Wait, the substituents are COOEt (strongly deactivating, meta-directing) and NH2 (strongly activating, ortho/para directing). But they're in para positions, so the H's around would have different shifts.

Wait, maybe the H ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and the H ortho to NH2 would be more shielded (lower ppm) or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two substituents with the same environment, leading to two equivalent sets of H's.

But in the NMR, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0. So 8.0 is higher, which is more deshielded, perhaps the H's ortho to the deactivating group (like the ester). The lower shift, 7.0, might be the H's ortho to the activating group (like NH2).

So for the benzoate ester, the COOEt is a strong deactivating group, which would cause the ortho H's to be more deshielded (higher ppm), around 8.0. The NH2 is activating, so the H's ortho to it would be less deshielded, perhaps around 7.0.

So in the NMR, the two H's ortho to COOEt (8.0 ppm) and the two H's ortho to NH2 (7.0 ppm). That fits with the given data.

Now, looking at the remaining NMR signals.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H): that would be the CH2 of the ethyl ester. So for ethyl ester, the CH2 is usually around 4.2-4.3, but in this case, it's at 4.5, which might be due to the proximity to the carbonyl group or the amino group. I'm not sure, but it's possible.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H): this is a bit confusing. Broad singlet suggests perhaps exchange with NH protons, but in this case, the molecule has an NH2 group. Wait, but in D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have a free NH2 group. But in the NMR, we don't see any peaks around 3.3-3.5 ppm for the NH2, which is a bit odd because amines usually show broad signals. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, or maybe it's not in the spectrum because of poor coupling or exchange broadening. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the IR. The IR has strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches, so the compound must have an NH group. So in option D, the NH2 would produce a broad peak in IR, which we have.

The 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl stretch, which fits with the ester carbonyl (around 1720-1740 cm-1). So that makes sense.

Now, let's check other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 at para position and HCONH- attached to benzene. The carbonyl would be in formamide, which typically has a higher wavenumber (around 1700-1720 cm-1). The IR of 1720 is okay.

In the NMR, the aromatic region would have two substituents in para positions. So the H's would be two doublets. The formamide group would have an NH which would show up in IR, which matches.

But what about the NMR chemical shifts? The HCONH– would have NH protons, which might be broad, but in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as broad. If it's an OCH2 group, that could fit. For example, if there's an OCH2 connected to something.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzamide with NH2 at 4-position and a propionate ester. So the structure would be O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2? Wait, but molecular formula would be C9H11NO3, because propionate is OCH2CH2CH3 (3 C), benzene (6 C), plus the amide group (CONH2 would contribute 1 C, 1 O, 1 N). So total O would be 3: propionate (O), amide (O), and another O? Wait, maybe not. Wait, for propionate ester, the formula is OCH2CH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO3 (since O from propionate, O from amide, and another O from COOEt? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute:

Ph-CONH2: C7H7NO2.

Adding an ethyl group as propionate (OCH2CH2CH3): that adds 3 C and 6 H (OCH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see: C7 (benzamide) + 3 (propionate) = 10 C. Wait, but the given formula is C9. So this option would have C10H... which doesn't match. So option C is out.

So back to options A, B, D.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the substituents are OCH2CH3 and CONH2 at meta positions. The aromatic protons would then be in positions 2,4,5,6. But if substituents are at 3 and (say) 1, then the H's in 2 and 6 would be ortho to OCH2CH3 and para to CONH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para arrangement, but I'm getting a bit confused.

In the NMR, the aromatic region would have more than two doublets if the substituents are not symmetric. But the given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests symmetry, like a para substitution. So if the substituents are para, then option A would have OCH2CH3 and CONH2 in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. But in that case, the IR would show N-H (amide) and OCH2CH3.

Looking at the NMR for option A: the ethoxy group would have CH2CH3. The 1.20 ppm triplet fits the CH3. The OCH2 would show up as a quartet around 4.1, but in the given data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is coupled with another group, making it shift upfield or downfield.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's the OCH2 in the ethoxy group? But in that case, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3, so it should be a quartet, not a singlet. So that would not fit.

In option A, would there be any other groups with 2H? The amide group has NH2, which would be a broad signal, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as singlet. That might not fit. Unless it's another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is part of an amide or another structure.

Wait, another thought: the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, as in an ester. If option D is correct, the quartet would be the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, and the ethyl CH3 would be the triplet.

Then, the 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but in D, the NH2 is a substituent on the benzene. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any signal for NH2. Or perhaps it's a broad signal that's not integrated or not visible. Alternatively, maybe it's a broad singlet from some other group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match the options with the data.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Molecular formula: benzoate is C7H6O2 (C6H5COOEt → C6H5COOCH2CH3). Wait, that would be C9H10O2. But with the amino group, it's C7H6O2 (benzoic acid) plus NH2 (C7H7NO2?), but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's compute the molecular formula for option D.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So:

Benzene ring: 6 C.

COOEt group: 2 C (from COO) + 2 C (from OCH2CH3) = 4 C.

Wait, benzene + COOEt is 6 + 3 = 9 C? No, wait, COOEt is one C (carbonyl), two O's, and the ethyl group is two C. So total for COOEt is 3 C (COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, so the COO is part of the benzoate). So, the whole molecule is:

C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) + 1 (NH2) → Wait, the NH2 is part of the benzene substituent. So the molecular formula would be:

Benzoate: C7H6O2 (C6H5COOEt is C8H8O2? Wait, no. Let me count:

C6H5COOEt: C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 10 C? No, wait, the COOEt is -O-CO-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Benzoate is C6H5COO-. So the ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3. That's 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? No, wait COO as in O=C-O-CH2CH3. So, for the benzoate ester, it's C6H5COOCH2CH3: which is 6 + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the COO is a single C (the carbonyl), so benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt → C6 (benzene) + 2 (COOEt: one C from COO, and two from Et). So total is 6 + 3 =9 C. So molecular formula is C9H10O2 plus the amino group adds NH2, which is 1 N and 2 H. So total is C9H12NO2? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate should be:

Each benzene ring has 6 C.

The benzoate ester group is -O-CO-OCH2CH3.

Wait, that would be:

Benzoate: C6H5COO-.

Ester: OCH2CH3.

So the full formula is C6H5COOCH2CH3 plus the NH2 substituent at position 4.

Wait, so:

C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = C6 + 4 = C10? No, wait the COO is one C (the carbonyl C). So the benzoate is C7H5O2 (C6H5COO-), plus ethyl ester (2 C), so C9H10O2. Then, adding the NH2 group (which adds 1 N and 2 H), so the formula becomes C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem because our calculation suggests 12 H, but the formula has 11.

Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps option D is not correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's calculate more carefully.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

The molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 (no C) → total 9 C. Correct.

Hydrogens: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: COOCH2CH3 and NH2). COOCH2CH3 group: the ethyl ester has 5 H (CH2CH3). NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 +5 +2 =11. O: from COO (2 O) and the ethyl ester (1 O), so 3 O. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so O is 2, but in this case it's 3. So that's a problem. So option D's formula is C9H11N O3? No. Wait, no. Let me calculate again.

Wait, the actual structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So:

- COOCH2CH3 group: COO has 2 O, the OCH2CH3 has another O. So total O is 3.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2. So option D is out.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me look at option B again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH– attached to a benzene ring with OCH2CH3 at para position.

So molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) + HCONH– (which is 2 C: HCO and NH). Wait, HCONH– is formamide, so the structure is HCONR. So the substituent is HCONH– attached to benzene, which has another substituent OCH2CH3 at para.

So molecular formula: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide: HCONH–) → 10 C? Wait, no. HCONH– is only one C (the carbonyl C). So 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 C. O: ethoxy (1 O) + formamide (1 O) → 2 O. N: 1 from formamide. H: let's compute.

Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents in para). Ethoxy group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3). Formamide group: HCONH– has 1 H (the H from HCO) and 2 H from NH. So total H: 4 +5 +1 +2 =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H, doesn't match. So option B is out.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me think about option A.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with OCH2CH3 at position 3.

So molecular formula:

Benzamide: C7H7NO2.

Adding OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) adds 2 C and 5 H. So total C:7 +2=9. H:7 +5=12. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H vs 11. Doesn't match.

Hmm, so maybe none of the options fit exactly. But wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: 1 C from COO, 2 from CH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C? No. Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is three C (C from COO and two from ethyl). So 6 + 3 =9 C. N: 1.

O: COO has two O, ethoxy has one O → 3 O.

H: benzene has 4 H. ethoxy has 5 H. NH2 has 2 H. So 4+5+2=11 H. But in the formula, it's C9H11NO3? Because O is 3, but the given formula is O2.

So this doesn't match.

So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the given molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2.

Looking for a structure with O=2.

Option D has O=3, which is a problem.

Option B has O=2? Let me recheck.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is HCONH– attached to 4-OCH2CH3 benzene.

So O in ethoxy (1) and O in formamide (1). So O=2. That fits.

So the molecular formula is C9H11NO2?

Let me compute.

Ph-OCH2CH3: C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) =8 C.

HCONH–: 2 C (HCO and NH?), no, HCONH– has one C (the carbonyl C).

Wait, HCONH– is formamide, which is HCONR. So the substituent is HCONH–, which has one C. So total C:6 +2 +1 =9.

O: ethoxy (1 O) and formamide (1 O) → 2 O.

N: 1.

H: benzene (4 H) + ethoxy (5 H) + formamide H (1 H from HCO) + NH (2 H from NH2) → 4+5+1+2=12 H. But given H is 11. Hmm, discrepancy again.

So perhaps the structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) formamide.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The formula is C9H11NO2.

So, 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Let me see: if the substituent is OCH2CH3 (2 C) and HCONH– (1 C), then total C is 6+3=9.

O: 2.

H: let's see. The benzene has four H. The ethoxy has 5 H. The formamide has HCONH–. So the H's would be:

Formamide: HCO has 1 H, NH has 2 H.

So 4 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +1 (HCO) +2 (NH) =12 H. But the formula is 11 H. Hmm, that's a problem.

So perhaps this option is incorrect as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrogen count. Let me think again: on the benzene ring, when there are two substituents, the number of H's depends on their positions. If it's para substitution, the ring would have two H's in each of the two doublet positions. So in option B, the para substituents are OCH2CH3 and HCONH–. So the benzene would have four H's in two pairs.

Wait, but the HCONH– group is attached to the benzene, so maybe some of the H's are part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the H's in the formamide are not part of the benzene. So in the benzene, with two substituents at para positions, the ring has two H's in each ortho position, leading to four H's in total. But in option B, the formamide substituent is HCONH–, so the H's on the benzene would be four (two in each ortho position).

So, let's recount:

H from benzene: 4.

H from ethoxy: 5.

H from formamide: 1 (HCO) + 2 (NH) =3.

Total H:4+5+3=12. Again, not matching 11.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking back at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → possibly an OCH2 group.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → CH2, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O.

Aromatic region: two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

So, the compound likely has an ethyl group (probably as an ester or ether), a carbonyl group, and an amino group.

Wait, considering the IR data: strong peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. That suggests N-H stretch, so an amide or amine group.

The 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. So if the carbonyl is an amide, it would typically be around 1650-1700 cm-1. But if it's an ester, it's higher, around 1720-1740. So the 1720 fits an ester.

So probably, the structure has an ester carbonyl and an amide or amine group.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

So, structure: O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2.

The ester would have the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The amino group would have N-H stretches (IR), and the ethyl group would produce the triplet and quartet in NMR.

So, in NMR:

Ethyl ester: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), 4.5 ppm (q, 2H).

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is confusing. Where would that come from? Alternatively, maybe that's the NH2 group, but NH2 protons are usually broad and appear around 1-5 ppm, but integrating to 2H. So perhaps that's the amino group.

Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H), which could be the NH2 group. But in that case, why is it appearing as a singlet? Because the two H's are equivalent and not split by any neighboring H's.

So, putting it all together:

IR: N-H (amide or amine) and ester carbonyl.

NMR:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

-4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2.

-4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2 of ester.

Aromatic: two doublets, para substitution.

So, the structure would have an ethyl ester and an amino group in para positions on the benzene.

So, the answer would be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But earlier, the molecular formula didn't match. Let me recalculate.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: formula is C9H11NO2?

Wait, benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt → C9H10O2. Adding the NH2 group (which is part of the substituent on the benzene), it's C6H5COOEt + NH2. So, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2? Because the NH2 adds two H's and one N.

Wait, the benzoate ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2. Adding the NH2 substituent: the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because the benzene in benzoate has five H (since it's a substituent), but when we add NH2, the H count increases by 2. Wait, no: the benzoate ester has benzene with one substituent (COOEt), so five H. Adding NH2 as a para substituent, the benzene now has two substituents, reducing H's to four. So the total H's would be:

COOEt contributes 5 H (ethyl group) → 5.

Benzene contributes 4 H.

NH2 contributes 2 H.

Total: 5 +4 +2 =11 H.

O: COOEt has two O, but the NH2 doesn't add O. Wait, no: COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which has two O's (from COO). So O is 2.

So the formula is C9 (6 from benzene, 3 from COOEt) H11 (as above), N (1), O (2).

Yes! So the formula matches.

So, the correct answer is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify an organic compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's think about what that means. The molecular formula can help determine the possible functional groups and structure.

The IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. Oh wait, 3420 and 3325 are both in the range for N-H stretches, especially in amines or amides. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or amide. Because 1720 is a bit higher, so maybe an ester or possibly a ketone, but given the formula, more likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, which suggests it's attached to a CH2 group. So maybe a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet because the neighboring group has two protons (like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, ethyl is CH2CH3. Oh wait, the triplet in ethyl is usually at around 1.2-1.3 ppm as the CH3, with the CH2 as a quartet around 4.0 or something? Wait, no, I might be mixing that up. Wait, ethyl groups in NMR: the CH2 connected to the oxygen is usually around 4.0-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2-1.4. So in this case, the 1.20 ppm is the CH3 of an ethyl group.

Then, 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange or perhaps a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like O or N. But a singlet, so no neighboring Hs. So perhaps a -OCH2- group, but in what context? Or maybe an ethyl group where the CH2 is attached to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, which is four peaks. 2H. Quartet suggests neighboring three Hs. Wait, but 2H as quartet... So that might be a CH2 connected to another CH2 group. Like in an ester, where the OCH2CH3 is split. Oh wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is more likely the CH2 connected to the ester oxygen. Wait, for ethyl esters, the CH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Hmm, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe if it's adjacent to something else, like a carbonyl or an amide group. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent, leading to a doublet each. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but the two doublets could also mean two different substituents in the para positions, each with two protons. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzamide or similar.

Putting this together, the compound likely has a benzene ring with a substituent and an ethyl group. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. Benzene (6 C) plus substituents: the substituent would have 3 C (since 9-6 =3). Wait, but the substituent might have more if there's an ester or amide group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. If it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are OCH2CH3 and CONH2 at positions 3 and... Wait, but the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2? Let's see: benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (3 C) + CONH2 (2 C, O, N). Wait, OCH2CH3 is 3 C (O, CH2, CH3?), no. Wait, OCH2CH3 is 2 carbons from the ethyl group. So benzamide is C7H7NO2 (C6H5CONH2). Adding an ethoxy substituent would add another O and two CH2 groups? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ethoxy and another group. Maybe the substituent is OCH2CH3 and another group on the benzene.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So substituent would be OCH2CH3 at position 4, and the formamide group (HCONR) attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with 4-OCH2CH3 and a formamide group (HCONH- attached to the benzene). But wait, that would make the formula something like C8H9NO3? Wait, let me check. Benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) + formamide (HCONH-) is another C, O, N. So total would be 6 + 2 + 1 (from formamide) + 1 (from NH?) Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate:

Formamide group is HCONR, where R is the aryl. So for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is O=C(NHPhOCH2CH3)H. So, the molecule would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 (ethoxyphenyl) connected to HCONH-.

Hmm, the molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 1 (formamide's carbonyl C) + H's: Let's see, benzene has 5 H (if substituted at 4 position with OCH2CH3 and formamide). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the molecular formula. The given formula is C9H11NO2.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C6H4OCH2CH3) plus HCONH- attached to the benzene.

So the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 with HCONH- attached to the para position. So the formula would be:

Ph is C6H5, but in this case, since OCH2CH3 is attached to the benzene, the benzene has one substituent as OCH2CH3. Then, the formamide group (HCONH-) is attached to another position, perhaps para to OCH2CH3.

Wait, the molecular formula would be: C6 (benzene) + OCH2CH3 (O, CH2, CH3) = 2 C from ethoxy, plus the formamide group, which is HCONH–, so that adds 1 C (the carbonyl C) and O and N. So total C: 6 + 2 + 1 = 9. O: from ethoxy (1 O), formamide has another O, so 2 O. N: 1 from formamide. So C9H? Let's see:

Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene (6 C) with OCH2CH3 (2 C, 5 H?), and HCONH–: that adds another H and N.

Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute:

Ph-OCH2CH3 is C6H5-OCH2CH3. Then, the formamide group is HCONH– attached to the benzene. So the entire molecule would be:

C6H4(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2)? Wait, no, because formamide is HCONHR, where R is the aryl group. So the structure would be O=C(NHPh-OCH2CH3)H. So the molecule is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 has 6 + 2 = 8 C; the formamide adds another C (the carbonyl C), so total 9 C. Now, H's: benzene ring has 4 H (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and HCONH– at para positions). OCH2CH3 contributes 2*2=4 H (OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 H and 3 CH3 H? Wait, OCH2CH3 is a substituent on the benzene, so it's OCH2CH3. The ethoxy group has 5 H: CH2CH3 has 2 H on CH2 and 3 on CH3. So ethoxy has 5 H. Then the formamide group: HCONH– would have how many H's? The H from HCO and the NH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula. Let's count each atom:

Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene ring is C6H5, but when connected to OCH2CH3, it would be C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the benzene has 4 H remaining (since two substituents). So the structure is:

C6H4(OCH2CH3)(HCONH2). Let me count:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (HCONH2) = 9 C.

O: O from ethoxy (1) + O from carbonyl (1) = 2 O.

N: 1 from HCONH2.

H: Benzene has 4 H. Ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3). Then, the HCONH2 has 1 (H) from HCO and 2 from NH2. So 4 +5 +1 +2 =12 H. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another approach: molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So the degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees: likely a benzene ring (3), one double bond (carbonyl, 1), and another double bond elsewhere? Or maybe an amide group which has a double bond. So perhaps an amide group (CONH-) which is a double bond. So that would account for 3 (benzene) + 1 (amide) + 1 (carbonyl) = 5. So that makes sense.

So the compound likely has a benzene ring, an amide group, and an ester or ethoxy group.

Looking at the NMR again.

The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) suggests an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen. The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad singlet) could be an OCH2 group. Wait, but where? If it's an ethyl ester, like OCH2CH3, then the CH2 would be around 4.1 as a quartet, and the CH3 around 1.2 as triplet.

Wait, but in our NMR data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's not the ethyl group attached to oxygen, but maybe something else.

Alternatively, the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be the CH2 connected to an oxygen, as in an ester. Let me think: in an ethyl ester, the CH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but here it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe because it's adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or an amide?

Looking at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. So the ester would be the OCH2CH3 group, and the amino group is at para position.

So NMR:

Ethyl ester group: The CH2 would be around 4.2 as quartet, CH3 as triplet around 1.2.

In the NMR data provided, the 4.5 is quartet for 2H. So perhaps it's a bit upfield, but maybe because of the amino group. Let's see.

The aromatic region: 7.0 (d,2H) and 8.0 (d,2H). If the substituents are at para positions (like OCH2CH3 and NH2), then the ring would have two substituents. Wait, but wait, 4-aminobenzoate ester would have a substituent at 4 position (NH2) and 1 ester (COOEt) at another position? Or maybe the ester is attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure where the benzoate is at the para position to the amino group. So benzene with COOEt at position 1 and NH2 at position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets: the two ortho to COOEt would be at higher ppm (around 8.0) and the two para would be lower (7.0). Or wait, actually, the amino group is a strong deactivating group, so the ring would have certain shifts.

Wait, for para-substituted benzoate esters, the two H ortho to the ester would be more deshielded and appear around 7.5-8.0, and the two H meta would be around 7.0-7.5. But in this case, the substituents are COOEt and NH2 in para. So the substituents are in positions 1 and 4.

So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. Or wait, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). So the H in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. H in positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the H's in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and H's in 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But in this case, position 2 and 6 are ortho to COOEt and meta to NH2. Position 3 and 5 are meta to COOEt and ortho to NH2.

Wait, the substituents are COOEt (strongly deactivating, meta-directing) and NH2 (strongly activating, ortho/para directing). But they're in para positions, so the H's around would have different shifts.

Wait, maybe the H ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm) and the H ortho to NH2 would be more shielded (lower ppm) or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has two substituents with the same environment, leading to two equivalent sets of H's.

But in the NMR, the two doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0. So 8.0 is higher, which is more deshielded, perhaps the H's ortho to the deactivating group (like the ester). The lower shift, 7.0, might be the H's ortho to the activating group (like NH2).

So for the benzoate ester, the COOEt is a strong deactivating group, which would cause the ortho H's to be more deshielded (higher ppm), around 8.0. The NH2 is activating, so the H's ortho to it would be less deshielded, perhaps around 7.0.

So in the NMR, the two H's ortho to COOEt (8.0 ppm) and the two H's ortho to NH2 (7.0 ppm). That fits with the given data.

Now, looking at the remaining NMR signals.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H): that would be the CH2 of the ethyl ester. So for ethyl ester, the CH2 is usually around 4.2-4.3, but in this case, it's at 4.5, which might be due to the proximity to the carbonyl group or the amino group. I'm not sure, but it's possible.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H): this is a bit confusing. Broad singlet suggests perhaps exchange with NH protons, but in this case, the molecule has an NH2 group. Wait, but in D, it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have a free NH2 group. But in the NMR, we don't see any peaks around 3.3-3.5 ppm for the NH2, which is a bit odd because amines usually show broad signals. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and not showing up, or maybe it's not in the spectrum because of poor coupling or exchange broadening. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the IR. The IR has strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches, so the compound must have an NH group. So in option D, the NH2 would produce a broad peak in IR, which we have.

The 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl stretch, which fits with the ester carbonyl (around 1720-1740 cm-1). So that makes sense.

Now, let's check other options.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is OCH2CH3 at para position and HCONH- attached to benzene. The carbonyl would be in formamide, which typically has a higher wavenumber (around 1700-1720 cm-1). The IR of 1720 is okay.

In the NMR, the aromatic region would have two substituents in para positions. So the H's would be two doublets. The formamide group would have an NH which would show up in IR, which matches.

But what about the NMR chemical shifts? The HCONH– would have NH protons, which might be broad, but in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as broad. If it's an OCH2 group, that could fit. For example, if there's an OCH2 connected to something.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzamide with NH2 at 4-position and a propionate ester. So the structure would be O=C(OCH2CH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2? Wait, but molecular formula would be C9H11NO3, because propionate is OCH2CH2CH3 (3 C), benzene (6 C), plus the amide group (CONH2 would contribute 1 C, 1 O, 1 N). So total O would be 3: propionate (O), amide (O), and another O? Wait, maybe not. Wait, for propionate ester, the formula is OCH2CH2CH3. So the molecular formula would be C9H11NO3 (since O from propionate, O from amide, and another O from COOEt? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute:

Ph-CONH2: C7H7NO2.

Adding an ethyl group as propionate (OCH2CH2CH3): that adds 3 C and 6 H (OCH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see: C7 (benzamide) + 3 (propionate) = 10 C. Wait, but the given formula is C9. So this option would have C10H... which doesn't match. So option C is out.

So back to options A, B, D.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the substituents are OCH2CH3 and CONH2 at meta positions. The aromatic protons would then be in positions 2,4,5,6. But if substituents are at 3 and (say) 1, then the H's in 2 and 6 would be ortho to OCH2CH3 and para to CONH2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para arrangement, but I'm getting a bit confused.

In the NMR, the aromatic region would have more than two doublets if the substituents are not symmetric. But the given NMR shows two doublets, which suggests symmetry, like a para substitution. So if the substituents are para, then option A would have OCH2CH3 and CONH2 in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits. But in that case, the IR would show N-H (amide) and OCH2CH3.

Looking at the NMR for option A: the ethoxy group would have CH2CH3. The 1.20 ppm triplet fits the CH3. The OCH2 would show up as a quartet around 4.1, but in the given data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm, maybe the OCH2 is coupled with another group, making it shift upfield or downfield.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Maybe it's the OCH2 in the ethoxy group? But in that case, the ethoxy's OCH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3, so it should be a quartet, not a singlet. So that would not fit.

In option A, would there be any other groups with 2H? The amide group has NH2, which would be a broad signal, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as singlet. That might not fit. Unless it's another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is part of an amide or another structure.

Wait, another thought: the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, as in an ester. If option D is correct, the quartet would be the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, and the ethyl CH3 would be the triplet.

Then, the 4.0 ppm could be the NH2 group, but in D, the NH2 is a substituent on the benzene. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any signal for NH2. Or perhaps it's a broad signal that's not integrated or not visible. Alternatively, maybe it's a broad singlet from some other group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match the options with the data.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Molecular formula: benzoate is C7H6O2 (C6H5COOEt → C6H5COOCH2CH3). Wait, that would be C9H10O2. But with the amino group, it's C7H6O2 (benzoic acid) plus NH2 (C7H7NO2?), but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's compute the molecular formula for option D.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So:

Benzene ring: 6 C.

COOEt group: 2 C (from COO) + 2 C (from OCH2CH3) = 4 C.

Wait, benzene + COOEt is 6 + 3 = 9 C? No, wait, COOEt is one C (carbonyl), two O's, and the ethyl group is two C. So total for COOEt is 3 C (COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, so the COO is part of the benzoate). So, the whole molecule is:

C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) + 1 (NH2) → Wait, the NH2 is part of the benzene substituent. So the molecular formula would be:

Benzoate: C7H6O2 (C6H5COOEt is C8H8O2? Wait, no. Let me count:

C6H5COOEt: C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 10 C? No, wait, the COOEt is -O-CO-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Benzoate is C6H5COO-. So the ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3. That's 6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? No, wait COO as in O=C-O-CH2CH3. So, for the benzoate ester, it's C6H5COOCH2CH3: which is 6 + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 10 C? Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the COO is a single C (the carbonyl), so benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt → C6 (benzene) + 2 (COOEt: one C from COO, and two from Et). So total is 6 + 3 =9 C. So molecular formula is C9H10O2 plus the amino group adds NH2, which is 1 N and 2 H. So total is C9H12NO2? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate should be:

Each benzene ring has 6 C.

The benzoate ester group is -O-CO-OCH2CH3.

Wait, that would be:

Benzoate: C6H5COO-.

Ester: OCH2CH3.

So the full formula is C6H5COOCH2CH3 plus the NH2 substituent at position 4.

Wait, so:

C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = C6 + 4 = C10? No, wait the COO is one C (the carbonyl C). So the benzoate is C7H5O2 (C6H5COO-), plus ethyl ester (2 C), so C9H10O2. Then, adding the NH2 group (which adds 1 N and 2 H), so the formula becomes C9H12NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem because our calculation suggests 12 H, but the formula has 11.

Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps option D is not correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's calculate more carefully.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

The molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + COOCH2CH3 (3 C) + NH2 (no C) → total 9 C. Correct.

Hydrogens: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: COOCH2CH3 and NH2). COOCH2CH3 group: the ethyl ester has 5 H (CH2CH3). NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 +5 +2 =11. O: from COO (2 O) and the ethyl ester (1 O), so 3 O. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so O is 2, but in this case it's 3. So that's a problem. So option D's formula is C9H11N O3? No. Wait, no. Let me calculate again.

Wait, the actual structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So:

- COOCH2CH3 group: COO has 2 O, the OCH2CH3 has another O. So total O is 3.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2. So option D is out.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me look at option B again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH– attached to a benzene ring with OCH2CH3 at para position.

So molecular formula: benzene (6 C) + OCH2CH3 (2 C) + HCONH– (which is 2 C: HCO and NH). Wait, HCONH– is formamide, so the structure is HCONR. So the substituent is HCONH– attached to benzene, which has another substituent OCH2CH3 at para.

So molecular formula: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide: HCONH–) → 10 C? Wait, no. HCONH– is only one C (the carbonyl C). So 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 C. O: ethoxy (1 O) + formamide (1 O) → 2 O. N: 1 from formamide. H: let's compute.

Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents in para). Ethoxy group contributes 5 H (CH2CH3). Formamide group: HCONH– has 1 H (the H from HCO) and 2 H from NH. So total H: 4 +5 +1 +2 =12 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H, doesn't match. So option B is out.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me think about option A.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with OCH2CH3 at position 3.

So molecular formula:

Benzamide: C7H7NO2.

Adding OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) adds 2 C and 5 H. So total C:7 +2=9. H:7 +5=12. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So 12 H vs 11. Doesn't match.

Hmm, so maybe none of the options fit exactly. But wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOCH2CH3: 1 C from COO, 2 from CH2CH3) + 1 (NH2) → 10 C? No. Wait, the COOCH2CH3 is three C (C from COO and two from ethyl). So 6 + 3 =9 C. N: 1.

O: COO has two O, ethoxy has one O → 3 O.

H: benzene has 4 H. ethoxy has 5 H. NH2 has 2 H. So 4+5+2=11 H. But in the formula, it's C9H11NO3? Because O is 3, but the given formula is O2.

So this doesn't match.

So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the given molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2.

Looking for a structure with O=2.

Option D has O=3, which is a problem.

Option B has O=2? Let me recheck.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is HCONH– attached to 4-OCH2CH3 benzene.

So O in ethoxy (1) and O in formamide (1). So O=2. That fits.

So the molecular formula is C9H11NO2?

Let me compute.

Ph-OCH2CH3: C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) =8 C.

HCONH–: 2 C (HCO and NH?), no, HCONH– has one C (the carbonyl C).

Wait, HCONH– is formamide, which is HCONR. So the substituent is HCONH–, which has one C. So total C:6 +2 +1 =9.

O: ethoxy (1 O) and formamide (1 O) → 2 O.

N: 1.

H: benzene (4 H) + ethoxy (5 H) + formamide H (1 H from HCO) + NH (2 H from NH2) → 4+5+1+2=12 H. But given H is 11. Hmm, discrepancy again.

So perhaps the structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl) formamide.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The formula is C9H11NO2.

So, 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Let me see: if the substituent is OCH2CH3 (2 C) and HCONH– (1 C), then total C is 6+3=9.

O: 2.

H: let's see. The benzene has four H. The ethoxy has 5 H. The formamide has HCONH–. So the H's would be:

Formamide: HCO has 1 H, NH has 2 H.

So 4 (benzene) +5 (ethoxy) +1 (HCO) +2 (NH) =12 H. But the formula is 11 H. Hmm, that's a problem.

So perhaps this option is incorrect as well.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrogen count. Let me think again: on the benzene ring, when there are two substituents, the number of H's depends on their positions. If it's para substitution, the ring would have two H's in each of the two doublet positions. So in option B, the para substituents are OCH2CH3 and HCONH–. So the benzene would have four H's in two pairs.

Wait, but the HCONH– group is attached to the benzene, so maybe some of the H's are part of the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the H's in the formamide are not part of the benzene. So in the benzene, with two substituents at para positions, the ring has two H's in each ortho position, leading to four H's in total. But in option B, the formamide substituent is HCONH–, so the H's on the benzene would be four (two in each ortho position).

So, let's recount:

H from benzene: 4.

H from ethoxy: 5.

H from formamide: 1 (HCO) + 2 (NH) =3.

Total H:4+5+3=12. Again, not matching 11.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking back at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → possibly an OCH2 group.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → CH2, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O.

Aromatic region: two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

So, the compound likely has an ethyl group (probably as an ester or ether), a carbonyl group, and an amino group.

Wait, considering the IR data: strong peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. That suggests N-H stretch, so an amide or amine group.

The 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. So if the carbonyl is an amide, it would typically be around 1650-1700 cm-1. But if it's an ester, it's higher, around 1720-1740. So the 1720 fits an ester.

So probably, the structure has an ester carbonyl and an amide or amine group.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

So, structure: O=C(OEt)-C6H4-NH2.

The ester would have the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. The amino group would have N-H stretches (IR), and the ethyl group would produce the triplet and quartet in NMR.

So, in NMR:

Ethyl ester: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), 4.5 ppm (q, 2H).

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is confusing. Where would that come from? Alternatively, maybe that's the NH2 group, but NH2 protons are usually broad and appear around 1-5 ppm, but integrating to 2H. So perhaps that's the amino group.

Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H), which could be the NH2 group. But in that case, why is it appearing as a singlet? Because the two H's are equivalent and not split by any neighboring H's.

So, putting it all together:

IR: N-H (amide or amine) and ester carbonyl.

NMR:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

-4.0 (bs, 2H): NH2.

-4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2 of ester.

Aromatic: two doublets, para substitution.

So, the structure would have an ethyl ester and an amino group in para positions on the benzene.

So, the answer would be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

But earlier, the molecular formula didn't match. Let me recalculate.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: formula is C9H11NO2?

Wait, benzoate ester is C6H5COOEt → C9H10O2. Adding the NH2 group (which is part of the substituent on the benzene), it's C6H5COOEt + NH2. So, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2? Because the NH2 adds two H's and one N.

Wait, the benzoate ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3 → C9H10O2. Adding the NH2 substituent: the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because the benzene in benzoate has five H (since it's a substituent), but when we add NH2, the H count increases by 2. Wait, no: the benzoate ester has benzene with one substituent (COOEt), so five H. Adding NH2 as a para substituent, the benzene now has two substituents, reducing H's to four. So the total H's would be:

COOEt contributes 5 H (ethyl group) → 5.

Benzene contributes 4 H.

NH2 contributes 2 H.

Total: 5 +4 +2 =11 H.

O: COOEt has two O, but the NH2 doesn't add O. Wait, no: COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which has two O's (from COO). So O is 2.

So the formula is C9 (6 from benzene, 3 from COOEt) H11 (as above), N (1), O (2).

Yes! So the formula matches.

So, the correct answer is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.
