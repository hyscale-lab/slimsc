Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Oh wait, but those details might not matter directly for this particular question. The key points are about the effective temperature and the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels.

When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's effective temperature decreases because of the spots. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). It says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm. So the ratio N1/N2 (number of atoms in level 1 over level 2) is decreasing when spots are present. So when the star doesn't have spots, this ratio is higher. We need to find the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range maybe? I remember that higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. But this might be a red or infrared line? 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV, specifically the Lyman series perhaps. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. Oh, but for the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference between the levels determines the ratio of populations.

In LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E the energies, k Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So T is lower in the spotted case.

But wait, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down, N1/N2 goes down. Let me think about what that implies.

The ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Let's assume that the energy difference E1 - E2 is positive (since level 1 is higher than level 2). Wait, no—wait, level 1 and level 2 could be either way. But the ratio N1/N2 is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. So if E1 > E2, then the exponential term is exp( -(positive)/(k T) ), which is a negative exponent.

Wait, no. Let's get it clear. Let's say level 2 is higher energy than level 1. Then E2 > E1. So E1 - E2 would be negative. So the exponent would be positive. So the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as E2 = E1 + ΔE, where ΔE is positive. So E2 > E1. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponential term increases because ΔE/(k T) decreases; the negative of that is a larger exponent. So as T increases, N1/N2 increases if ΔE is positive, because exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller.

Wait, let's make it concrete. Suppose T is higher when the star is spotless (6000 K) than when it's spotted (5500 K). So when T increases, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes less negative, so the exponential becomes larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), N1/N2 also decreases. Which makes sense if ΔE is positive because with lower T, the ratio would be smaller.

So the ratio N1/N2 is inversely proportional to T, in an exponential way. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher.

Now, the transition between the two energy levels is at a wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

Hmm, but maybe we don't need the exact value because the ratio change is determined by the temperatures.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). Wait, let me re-derive the Boltzmann equation correctly.

The Boltzmann distribution says N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Let me define the energy levels: let E1 be the energy of level 1, E2 the energy of level 2. Suppose E1 < E2, so level 2 is higher. Then E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let me define i as level 2 and j as level 1. Then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to set it up as N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, why am I getting confused? Let me think: the general formula is N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i is higher than E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive. So the exponent is negative, meaning that N_i / N_j is less than 1 if g_i/g_j is 1. Because exp(-x) is less than 1 for x positive.

So, if level 2 is higher than level 1, E2 > E1, so E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So N2/N1 decreases as T increases because the exponent becomes less negative, making the exp term larger, but wait no, wait: exp(-x) increases when x decreases. So higher T makes x = ΔE/(kT) smaller, so exp(-x) is larger. So N2/N1 decreases when T increases because ΔE/(kT) is smaller, making exp(-x) larger, but wait, N2/N1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if T increases, and assuming g's are same or fixed, N2/N1 increases because the exponential term increases. Hmm, but wait: no, because if T increases, the denominator kT increases, so ΔE/(kT) decreases. So exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases because the exponent is less negative. So N2/N1 increases with T if g's are same.

Wait, but in our problem, the ratio N1/N2 is the reciprocal of N2/N1. So if N2/N1 increases with T, then N1/N2 would decrease with T. Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, no: when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. Because N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is the same as the reciprocal of exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T') ) when T' is higher.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the ratio N1/N2 as:

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases (when the star has spots), the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes larger, because T is smaller. So the exponential term becomes larger, so N1/N2 becomes larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that contradicts. So perhaps I flipped the levels.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which would be the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But in the problem, when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So if T decreases, the ratio decreases. But according to the formula, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) increases, so the exponential increases, making N1/N2 increase. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that suggests that my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it.

The Boltzmann distribution is: the ratio of populations is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

So, N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So N_i/N_j is less than 1 if g_i/g_j =1, because exp(-x) is less than 1 for x positive.

So, for example, if level 1 is lower energy than level 2, then E1 < E2. So E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, so N2/N1 increases.

Which means that N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's correct. So when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, so N1/N2 is lower. So when the star is without spots (higher T), N1/N2 is lower than when the star has spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, the problem says: 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.' So before, when no spots, the ratio was higher, and when spots, it's lower.

Wait, but according to my analysis, when T increases (no spots, T=6000K), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So when T is lower (spots, T=5500K), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy levels. Let me think again. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

So, E_i (i=1) is higher than E_j (j=2). Then N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E1 - E2 (positive).

So in this case, when T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * [something that decreases with T].

So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. Thus, when the star has no spots (T=6000K), N1/N2 is lower than when the star has spots (T=5500K), where N1/N2 would be higher.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. That would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that's the opposite of what I just found.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

The problem says when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) and the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower.

So if N1/N2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), and T is lower, then that ratio would be larger, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, maybe the correct ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Then, when T is lower, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes more negative, so exp of that is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller when T is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

So in this case, the formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, the exp increases, so N1/N2 increases. But wait, the problem says when T decreases (spots), N1/N2 decreases. So this would fit.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Let's say E1 is higher than E2. So ΔE = E1 - E2 = positive.

So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so exp(-x) is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller.

Which is what the problem says: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, but that would mean that when T is higher, the ratio is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's correct.

So the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )

And when spots are present, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is R1/R2.

So R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor out ΔE/k: exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Compute the term inside the exponent:

(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (3.3e7) ) ≈ 500 / 33,000,000 = approx 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is ΔE/(k) * 1.515e-5.

But wait, we can compute this term using the wavelength.

Because the transition corresponds to wavelength λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

The energy of the photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/(λ). So we can compute ΔE.

So let's compute ΔE/(k) in terms of temperature.

ΔE/(k) = hc/(λ k) = (hc)/(λ k) 

But hc = 12400 eV·Å (since h*c ≈ 1240 eV·nm, and 1 nm = 10 Å, so 1240 eV·nm = 12400 eV·Å )

So ΔE/(k) = (12400 eV·Å ) / ( λ (Å) * k )

Wait, but k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K: k ≈ 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (12400) / (1448 * 8.617e-5 )

Compute that:

12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.57.

Then, 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approx 100,000 (since 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 1e5 )

Wait, let's compute 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

So 8.57 / 0.00008617 = approximately 8.57 * 11594 ≈ let's compute 8 * 11594 = 92752, 0.57 * 11594 ≈ 6596. So total around 99,348 ≈ 9.9e4.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.9e4 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Then, ΔE/(k) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 99341 K ≈ 9.93e4 K.

Now, going back to the exponent:

ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 9.93e4 K * (1.515e-5 1/K )

Multiply them:

9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515) * 1e-1 ≈ (15.03) * 0.1 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503. Let's compute e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^0.003 is approx 1.003, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ 4.496.

Wait, but let me compute e^1.503 more accurately.

We know that ln(4.48) is about 1.5, since e^1.5 is around 4.4817.

But 1.503 is just a little over 1.5, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.4817 * e^0.003.

e^0.003 is approximately 1 + 0.003 + (0.003^2)/2 ≈ 1.0030045.

So 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ approximately 4.496.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the correct answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann distribution in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem states that the ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) decreases when the star has spots (lower \( T \)).
2. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{12400 \, \text{eV·Å}}{1448 \, \text{Å}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]
3. The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) depends exponentially on \( T \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56 \, \text{eV}}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}} \approx 99341 \, \text{K}.
   \]
2. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
3. Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99341 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.503.
   \]
4. Compute the factor:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.496.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) increases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star transitions from having spots to no spots. This matches option **C**.

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Oh wait, but those details might not matter directly for this particular question. The key points are about the effective temperature and the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels.

When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's effective temperature decreases because of the spots. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). It says that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm. So the ratio N1/N2 (number of atoms in level 1 over level 2) is decreasing when spots are present. So when the star doesn't have spots, this ratio is higher. We need to find the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range maybe? I remember that higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. But this might be a red or infrared line? 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV, specifically the Lyman series perhaps. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. Oh, but for the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference between the levels determines the ratio of populations.

In LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations is given by the Boltzmann equation: N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E the energies, k Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So T is lower in the spotted case.

But wait, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down, N1/N2 goes down. Let me think about what that implies.

The ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Let's assume that the energy difference E1 - E2 is positive (since level 1 is higher than level 2). Wait, no—wait, level 1 and level 2 could be either way. But the ratio N1/N2 is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. So if E1 > E2, then the exponential term is exp( -(positive)/(k T) ), which is a negative exponent.

Wait, no. Let's get it clear. Let's say level 2 is higher energy than level 1. Then E2 > E1. So E1 - E2 would be negative. So the exponent would be positive. So the ratio N1/N2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as E2 = E1 + ΔE, where ΔE is positive. So E2 > E1. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponential term increases because ΔE/(k T) decreases; the negative of that is a larger exponent. So as T increases, N1/N2 increases if ΔE is positive, because exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller.

Wait, let's make it concrete. Suppose T is higher when the star is spotless (6000 K) than when it's spotted (5500 K). So when T increases, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes less negative, so the exponential becomes larger. So N1/N2 increases with T.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), N1/N2 also decreases. Which makes sense if ΔE is positive because with lower T, the ratio would be smaller.

So the ratio N1/N2 is inversely proportional to T, in an exponential way. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher.

Now, the transition between the two energy levels is at a wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

Hmm, but maybe we don't need the exact value because the ratio change is determined by the temperatures.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). Wait, let me re-derive the Boltzmann equation correctly.

The Boltzmann distribution says N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Let me define the energy levels: let E1 be the energy of level 1, E2 the energy of level 2. Suppose E1 < E2, so level 2 is higher. Then E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let me define i as level 2 and j as level 1. Then N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to set it up as N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, why am I getting confused? Let me think: the general formula is N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i is higher than E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive. So the exponent is negative, meaning that N_i / N_j is less than 1 if g_i/g_j is 1. Because exp(-x) is less than 1 for x positive.

So, if level 2 is higher than level 1, E2 > E1, so E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So N2/N1 decreases as T increases because the exponent becomes less negative, making the exp term larger, but wait no, wait: exp(-x) increases when x decreases. So higher T makes x = ΔE/(kT) smaller, so exp(-x) is larger. So N2/N1 decreases when T increases because ΔE/(kT) is smaller, making exp(-x) larger, but wait, N2/N1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if T increases, and assuming g's are same or fixed, N2/N1 increases because the exponential term increases. Hmm, but wait: no, because if T increases, the denominator kT increases, so ΔE/(kT) decreases. So exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases because the exponent is less negative. So N2/N1 increases with T if g's are same.

Wait, but in our problem, the ratio N1/N2 is the reciprocal of N2/N1. So if N2/N1 increases with T, then N1/N2 would decrease with T. Which aligns with the problem statement: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, no: when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. Because N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), which is the same as the reciprocal of exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T') ) when T' is higher.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think of the ratio N1/N2 as:

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases (when the star has spots), the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes larger, because T is smaller. So the exponential term becomes larger, so N1/N2 becomes larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that contradicts. So perhaps I flipped the levels.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which would be the same as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But in the problem, when spots are present, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. So if T decreases, the ratio decreases. But according to the formula, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) increases, so the exponential increases, making N1/N2 increase. But the problem says the ratio decreases. Hmm, that suggests that my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it.

The Boltzmann distribution is: the ratio of populations is proportional to the Boltzmann factor.

So, N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So N_i/N_j is less than 1 if g_i/g_j =1, because exp(-x) is less than 1 for x positive.

So, for example, if level 1 is lower energy than level 2, then E1 < E2. So E_i (i=2) is higher than E_j (j=1). So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, so N2/N1 increases.

Which means that N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's correct. So when T is higher, N2/N1 is higher, so N1/N2 is lower. So when the star is without spots (higher T), N1/N2 is lower than when the star has spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, the problem says: 'the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots.' So before, when no spots, the ratio was higher, and when spots, it's lower.

Wait, but according to my analysis, when T increases (no spots, T=6000K), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T is higher, N1/N2 is lower. So when T is lower (spots, T=5500K), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy levels. Let me think again. Maybe level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

So, E_i (i=1) is higher than E_j (j=2). Then N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E1 - E2 (positive).

So in this case, when T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * [something that decreases with T].

So when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. Thus, when the star has no spots (T=6000K), N1/N2 is lower than when the star has spots (T=5500K), where N1/N2 would be higher.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. That would mean that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So that's the opposite of what I just found.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to approach this differently.

The problem says when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) and the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower.

So if N1/N2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), and T is lower, then that ratio would be larger, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, maybe the correct ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Then, when T is lower, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes more negative, so exp of that is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller when T is lower. Which matches the problem statement.

So in this case, the formula is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, the exp increases, so N1/N2 increases. But wait, the problem says when T decreases (spots), N1/N2 decreases. So this would fit.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Let's say E1 is higher than E2. So ΔE = E1 - E2 = positive.

So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so exp(-x) is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller.

Which is what the problem says: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots.

Wait, but that would mean that when T is higher, the ratio is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's correct.

So the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 6000) )

And when spots are present, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k * 5500) )

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is R1/R2.

So R1/R2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Factor out ΔE/k: exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ] )

Compute the term inside the exponent:

(1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (3.3e7) ) ≈ 500 / 33,000,000 = approx 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is ΔE/(k) * 1.515e-5.

But wait, we can compute this term using the wavelength.

Because the transition corresponds to wavelength λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

The energy of the photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/(λ). So we can compute ΔE.

So let's compute ΔE/(k) in terms of temperature.

ΔE/(k) = hc/(λ k) = (hc)/(λ k) 

But hc = 12400 eV·Å (since h*c ≈ 1240 eV·nm, and 1 nm = 10 Å, so 1240 eV·nm = 12400 eV·Å )

So ΔE/(k) = (12400 eV·Å ) / ( λ (Å) * k )

Wait, but k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K: k ≈ 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (12400) / (1448 * 8.617e-5 )

Compute that:

12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.57.

Then, 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approx 100,000 (since 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 1e5 )

Wait, let's compute 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617.

So 8.57 / 0.00008617 = approximately 8.57 * 11594 ≈ let's compute 8 * 11594 = 92752, 0.57 * 11594 ≈ 6596. So total around 99,348 ≈ 9.9e4.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 9.9e4 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) ) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE ≈ 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Then, ΔE/(k) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 99341 K ≈ 9.93e4 K.

Now, going back to the exponent:

ΔE/(k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 9.93e4 K * (1.515e-5 1/K )

Multiply them:

9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 * 1.515) * 1e-1 ≈ (15.03) * 0.1 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503. Let's compute e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^0.003 is approx 1.003, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ 4.496.

Wait, but let me compute e^1.503 more accurately.

We know that ln(4.48) is about 1.5, since e^1.5 is around 4.4817.

But 1.503 is just a little over 1.5, so e^1.503 ≈ 4.4817 * e^0.003.

e^0.003 is approximately 1 + 0.003 + (0.003^2)/2 ≈ 1.0030045.

So 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ approximately 4.496.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann distribution in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem states that the ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) decreases when the star has spots (lower \( T \)).
2. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{12400 \, \text{eV·Å}}{1448 \, \text{Å}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]
3. The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) depends exponentially on \( T \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56 \, \text{eV}}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}} \approx 99341 \, \text{K}.
   \]
2. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
3. Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99341 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.503.
   \]
4. Compute the factor:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.496.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio \( N_1/N_2 \) increases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star transitions from having spots to no spots. This matches option **C**.
