Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state, and determining which partial wave isn't allowed based on certain quantum numbers.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully. The initial state is two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. That's a notation I remember from my studies. I think the general term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, S must be 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is the orbital angular momentum, and the J is the total angular momentum. Wait, in 1S0, J is 0, so the state is spin-singlet with no orbital angular momentum? Or wait, maybe L is S here? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So in 1S0, S is 0, L is the orbital part which is denoted by S (which is a letter, so S corresponds to L=0. Wait, no, S corresponds to L=0? Or wait, the spectroscopic notation: S is L=0, P is L=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So the term 1S0 would have S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (since it's S), and J=0. That makes sense because orbital angular momentum L is zero, spin S is zero, so total J is 0.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. Now, the system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the initial NN state is bound, and after emission, the NN state is in some other state, and they emit X.

The problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I'm not entirely sure what that means. T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, right? So for the final state, the isospin T of NN is 0. So according to the equation, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, and J=0. But after emission, the NN state might have different quantum numbers. The problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

So, S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN state must be odd.

Wait, but is this equation for the initial state or the final state? Hmm. The question says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy...". So it's the final state's S, L, and T that are involved. So in the final state, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So their sum must be odd.

Now, the initial state was NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0. So the initial spin and orbital angular momenta are 0 each. When they emit a particle X, which has some angular momentum, this must conserve angular momentum. The same goes for parity; parity must be conserved in the process, considering the intrinsic parity of X.

The problem requires us to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each giving a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle with a specific letter (p, s, f, etc.), which I think denotes the spin state of X.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 → something + p. Wait, the letters p, s, f probably denote the spin or something else of the emitted particle X. Or perhaps the lowercase letters denote the spin of X. Or maybe the angular momentum state of X? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So, for example, 'p' would correspond to X having angular momentum l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, etc. Or wait, no, the angular momentum state is given by the letter, like s, p, d, etc., which correspond to orbital angular momentum l=0,1,2... So for example, in option B, the particle X is a p, which would mean l=1.

But wait, the emitted particle's parity is given as -1. The intrinsic parity of a particle is determined by its quantum numbers. For a boson, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum. So if X has l=1, its parity is (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches the given intrinsic parity of X, which is -1. So X must have an orbital angular momentum (or perhaps its spin?) that gives it a parity of -1.

Wait no, the intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, and for a spin-0 particle, it's either +1 or -1. For particles with integer spin, like pions, which are spin-0, their parity is determined by their quantum numbers. For example, the pion has parity -1. Wait, but wait, the pion is a pseudoscalar meson, so its intrinsic parity is -1 (since it's spin-0, parity is (-1)^(L+S) where L is orbital angular momentum, but for a spin-0 particle, orbital angular momentum might be involved in the decay... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.

Wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So for X, parity is P_X = -1. Now, the process of emission must conserve parity. So the initial parity (of the NN system) times the parity of X must equal the final parity of the NN system times any other factors, but wait, in the process, the parity of the initial state times that of X should equal the parity of the final state times any other factors. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to model the parity conservation as P_initial * P_X = P_final. Because the emitted particle's parity is intrinsic, but when it's emitted, the initial and final states' parities must balance with X's parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. What is its parity? Well, parity is P = (-1)^L. For the initial state, L=0 (since it's S state), so parity is (+1). Because P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0=1.

So the initial parity P_initial is +1. X has parity P_X = -1. So the parity of the final state must satisfy P_initial * P_X = P_final * (-1)^something else? Or wait, when a particle is emitted, the parity should obey P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X in the process. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, considering that the process is NN → NN' + X. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) must equal the parity of the final state (P_final) multiplied by the parity of X (P_X) and the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission. Wait, the orbital angular momentum L of X in the decay process contributes a (-1)^L factor.

So, the parity conservation equation would be: P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay.

Wait, but X is emitted with some angular momentum state. So the orbital angular momentum here is the relative angular momentum between the two nucleons and the emitted particle. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the initial state parity is +1. The final state parity is P_final, which is the parity of the NN' state. X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity conservation equation is: P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. Because when X is emitted, it carries away some angular momentum L, which affects the parity.

So, putting in the numbers: 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L → 1 = P_final * (-1)^(L+1). So rearranged, P_final = (-1)^(L+1 +1) ? No, wait, let me re-arrange the equation.

Wait, 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L → 1 = P_final * (-1)^(L+1). So moving everything to one side, P_final = (-1)^(L +1 + 1) ? No, wait, let's solve for P_final.

P_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^L ] * P_X? Hmm, maybe better to re-express:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.

So 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = - P_final (-1)^L_X → P_final = (-1)^(L_X +1).

Because 1 = - P_final (-1)^L_X → P_final = (-1)^(L_X +1) * (-1) → Wait, let me do it again.

Let me write the equation: 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = P_final * (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, solving for P_final, we get P_final = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ] → which is (-1)^{L_X +1} * (-1)^{something?}.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's take the equation:

1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = P_final * (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, P_final = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ] → which is (-1)^{ -(L_X +1)} ) → which is same as (-1)^{ L_X +1 } because (-1)^{-n} = (-1)^n.

So P_final = [ (-1)^{ L_X +1 } ].

Another way: P_final = (-1)^{ L_X +1 }.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider the possible values of L_X and see what P_final comes out to be, and then see how it relates to the final state's L.

Wait, the final state's L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. The parity of that state is P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state.

So, from the parity conservation equation, we have:

P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{ L_X +1 }.

Which implies that L_NN' ≡ L_X + 1 mod 2. So L_NN' and L_X must have opposite parity.

So, L_NN' is even if L_X is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the problem also gives us that in the final state, the NN' system has T=0. And from earlier, we have that for the final state, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, S + L must be odd.

Now, the initial state is NN in 1S0, so S =0, L=0, J=0.

When the particle X is emitted, the NN' system will have some new S' (spin), L' (orbital), and J', which must satisfy the conservation laws.

Wait, but the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN' system would change depending on how X is emitted.

Wait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state's angular momentum J_final must be the vector sum of the NN' system's J' and X's angular momentum J_X. But this can get complicated because angular momentum is a vector quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at each option and see which one doesn't satisfy the conditions.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Each of these options describes the transition to a new NN state plus the particle X. The letters after the plus signs (p, s, f) are the angular momentum states of X, which correspond to l=1 (p), l=0 (s), l=3 (f)?

Wait, no, the letters correspond to the orbital angular momentum of X. So 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc. So the emitted X in each option has l equal to the letter's l value.

So in option A, X is a 'p' → l=1.

Option B: X is 'p' → l=1.

Option C: X is 'f' → l=3.

Option D: X is 's' → l=0.

Wait, but the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. How does the intrinsic parity relate to the particle's l and spin? For a spin-0 particle, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^L where L is the orbital angular momentum in the rest frame. For example, pions (which are spin-0) have parity -1, so their orbital angular momentum must be such that (-1)^L = -1 → L=1, 3, etc. But in the decay, the orbital angular momentum is the relative angular momentum in the emission process, which might be different from the particle's own orbital angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, but the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So regardless of the emission process, X's parity is -1. So the parity conservation equation must hold: P_initial * P_X = (-1)^L_X * P_final.

Wait, earlier I thought P_initial = 1, P_X = -1, so 1 = (-1) * (-1)^L_X * P_final → 1 = (-1)^{L_X + 1} * P_final → So P_final = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

But P_final is the parity of the final NN state, which is (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state.

Thus, (-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{L_X +1} → L_NN' ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

So L_NN' and L_X have opposite parity.

Now, the final state for each option has a given L.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (since D is l=2) → L_NN' =2.

X is p → l=1 → L_X=1.

So L_NN' is 2, which is even. L_X is 1, which is odd. So L_NN' = L_X +1 → 2 = 1 +1 → 2=2. Yes, that works.

Also, we have the condition that S + L ≡1 mod 2 in the final state.

In the final state, the spin S is part of the term symbol. Let's see:

Option A: 7D1 is (2S'+1) D^1 → the term symbol is (2S'+1)L^J.

Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So for 7D1, the 7 means (2S'+1)=7 → S'=3, since 2*3+1=7.

L is D, which is l=2.

So in the final state, S' =3, L'=2.

So S + L = 3+2=5 → 5 mod 2 is 1 → which satisfies the condition S+L ≡1 mod 2. So this is allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → (2S'+1) =3 → S'=1.

L is S → l=0.

So S' =1, L' =0.

S + L =1 +0=1 → mod 2 is 1. So condition is satisfied.

Now, X is p → l=1. So L_X=1.

L_NN' is 0 (since L'=0 from 3S1). So 0 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2 → 0 ≡ (1 +1) mod2 → 0 ≡0 mod2. So yes, parity is conserved.

But wait, let me double-check the parity part.

In option B, L_NN' is 0, L_X is 1.

So from the equation: L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 0 =1 +1 mod2 → 0=0. Correct.

So condition is satisfied. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L is D → l=2.

So S + L =1+2=3 → mod2 is 1. Condition satisfied.

X is f → l=3.

So L_X=3.

L_NN' is 2.

So L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 2 =3 +1 mod2 → 2=4 mod2 → 2=0. 4 mod2 is 0, so 2 mod2 is 0. So 0=0 → correct.

So parity condition holds.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L is P → l=1.

So S + L =1+1=2 → mod2 is 0. Which doesn't satisfy the condition S+L ≡1 mod2. So this would make the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 → T = 0 +1 +1=2 mod2=0 → which is correct, but wait the condition is given as T= S + L +1 mod2, and T is 0.

Wait, wait, in the final state, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So if S + L is 2 (mod2: 0), then T=0+1=1 mod2. But the problem states that T is 0. So this would be a problem. So the final state in option D would have T=1, which violates the given condition that T=0.

Wait, but let me check the initial setup again.

The problem states that the final state has T=0. So the condition is 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1. Sum is 2 → mod2 is 0. So condition is not met. Thus, option D's state would have T=(0 + L +1) mod2 = (0 +1 +1)=0 mod2=0? Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express the condition.

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So if S + L is 0 mod2, then T = 0 +1=1 mod2. But in the problem, T=0. So this would make the condition 0 ≡1 mod2, which isn't true. Thus, option D's final state can't have T=0 because S+L is even, leading to T=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's calculate T for each option.

For the final state in each option:

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → 5 mod2=1. So T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0. Correct.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1→ T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3→3 mod2=1 → T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →1+1=2→ mod2=0 → T=0+1=1 mod2=1. But the problem states T=0. So option D's final state would have T=1, which is not allowed. So this transition is prohibited because it would result in T=1, which doesn't match T=0.

Wait, but the problem says that the final state has T=0, so any option that leads to T=1 is invalid. So option D's transition would lead to T=1, which isn't allowed. Thus, option D is not permitted.

Wait, but let me confirm the parity condition for option D.

X is 's' → l=0.

So L_X=0.

In option D, the final state has L_NN' =1 (since it's P, l=1).

So from parity condition: L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 1 =0 +1 → 1=1 → correct.

So parity is conserved, but the isospin condition isn't met. So the transition in option D leads to a state with T=1, which violates the given T=0. So this transition is forbidden.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. Each option describes a different partial wave emitted. So the forbidden one is the one that doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options describe the initial state (1S0) transitioning into a new state plus X. So the forbidden transition is the one where the final NN state doesn't satisfy the given T=0 condition.

So, the correct answer is option D, because it leads to T=1, which isn't allowed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in the 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the Pauli exclusion principle requires that \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). This implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) for the final state. Additionally, parity conservation must be satisfied, which relates the parity of the initial and final states through the emitted particle X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State (1S0):**  
   - \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), \( J = 0 \), and parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = +1 \).

2. **Final State Conditions:**  
   - \( T(NN) = 0 \), so \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).  
   - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^{L_X} \), where \( P_X = -1 \) (given) and \( L_X \) is the orbital angular momentum of X.

   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), the parity conservation equation becomes:  
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_X} \implies P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.
   \]  
   The parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{NN}} \), so:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{NN}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1} \implies L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

3. **Analysis of Each Option:**  
   Each option describes a transition from 1S0 to a final NN state plus a particle X with a specific angular momentum state (denoted by the lowercase letter). The angular momentum \( L_X \) is determined by the letter:  
   - \( p \to L_X = 1 \),  
   - \( s \to L_X = 0 \),  
   - \( f \to L_X = 3 \).

   For each option, we check the final NN state's \( S \) and \( L \), verify the isospin condition \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), and ensure parity conservation.

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     - Final state: \( 7D1 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 7 \implies S' = 3 \), and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D corresponds to \( l = 2 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 1 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 2 = 1 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3S1 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 0 \) (S corresponds to \( l = 0 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 1 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 0 = 1 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3D3 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D corresponds to \( l = 2 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 3 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 2 = 3 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3P0 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 1 \) (P corresponds to \( l = 1 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which does not satisfy the isospin condition \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).  
     - Additionally, \( L_X = 0 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 1 = 0 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - However, the isospin condition is violated, making this transition **not permitted**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave not permitted is the one described in **Option D** because it violates the isospin condition \( T(NN) = 0 \). 

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state, and determining which partial wave isn't allowed based on certain quantum numbers.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully. The initial state is two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. That's a notation I remember from my studies. I think the general term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, S must be 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is the orbital angular momentum, and the J is the total angular momentum. Wait, in 1S0, J is 0, so the state is spin-singlet with no orbital angular momentum? Or wait, maybe L is S here? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So in 1S0, S is 0, L is the orbital part which is denoted by S (which is a letter, so S corresponds to L=0. Wait, no, S corresponds to L=0? Or wait, the spectroscopic notation: S is L=0, P is L=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So the term 1S0 would have S=0 (since 2S+1=1), L=0 (since it's S), and J=0. That makes sense because orbital angular momentum L is zero, spin S is zero, so total J is 0.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0. Now, the system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the initial NN state is bound, and after emission, the NN state is in some other state, and they emit X.

The problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. I'm not entirely sure what that means. T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, right? So for the final state, the isospin T of NN is 0. So according to the equation, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, and J=0. But after emission, the NN state might have different quantum numbers. The problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

So, S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN state must be odd.

Wait, but is this equation for the initial state or the final state? Hmm. The question says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy...". So it's the final state's S, L, and T that are involved. So in the final state, T=0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So their sum must be odd.

Now, the initial state was NN in 1S0: S=0, L=0. So the initial spin and orbital angular momenta are 0 each. When they emit a particle X, which has some angular momentum, this must conserve angular momentum. The same goes for parity; parity must be conserved in the process, considering the intrinsic parity of X.

The problem requires us to find which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each giving a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle with a specific letter (p, s, f, etc.), which I think denotes the spin state of X.

Wait, the options are like 1S0 → something + p. Wait, the letters p, s, f probably denote the spin or something else of the emitted particle X. Or perhaps the lowercase letters denote the spin of X. Or maybe the angular momentum state of X? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So, for example, 'p' would correspond to X having angular momentum l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, etc. Or wait, no, the angular momentum state is given by the letter, like s, p, d, etc., which correspond to orbital angular momentum l=0,1,2... So for example, in option B, the particle X is a p, which would mean l=1.

But wait, the emitted particle's parity is given as -1. The intrinsic parity of a particle is determined by its quantum numbers. For a boson, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum. So if X has l=1, its parity is (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches the given intrinsic parity of X, which is -1. So X must have an orbital angular momentum (or perhaps its spin?) that gives it a parity of -1.

Wait no, the intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, and for a spin-0 particle, it's either +1 or -1. For particles with integer spin, like pions, which are spin-0, their parity is determined by their quantum numbers. For example, the pion has parity -1. Wait, but wait, the pion is a pseudoscalar meson, so its intrinsic parity is -1 (since it's spin-0, parity is (-1)^(L+S) where L is orbital angular momentum, but for a spin-0 particle, orbital angular momentum might be involved in the decay... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently.

Wait, the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So for X, parity is P_X = -1. Now, the process of emission must conserve parity. So the initial parity (of the NN system) times the parity of X must equal the final parity of the NN system times any other factors, but wait, in the process, the parity of the initial state times that of X should equal the parity of the final state times any other factors. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to model the parity conservation as P_initial * P_X = P_final. Because the emitted particle's parity is intrinsic, but when it's emitted, the initial and final states' parities must balance with X's parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. What is its parity? Well, parity is P = (-1)^L. For the initial state, L=0 (since it's S state), so parity is (+1). Because P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0=1.

So the initial parity P_initial is +1. X has parity P_X = -1. So the parity of the final state must satisfy P_initial * P_X = P_final * (-1)^something else? Or wait, when a particle is emitted, the parity should obey P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X in the process. Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, considering that the process is NN → NN' + X. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) must equal the parity of the final state (P_final) multiplied by the parity of X (P_X) and the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission. Wait, the orbital angular momentum L of X in the decay process contributes a (-1)^L factor.

So, the parity conservation equation would be: P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X, where L_X is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay.

Wait, but X is emitted with some angular momentum state. So the orbital angular momentum here is the relative angular momentum between the two nucleons and the emitted particle. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the initial state parity is +1. The final state parity is P_final, which is the parity of the NN' state. X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity conservation equation is: P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X in the decay. Because when X is emitted, it carries away some angular momentum L, which affects the parity.

So, putting in the numbers: 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L → 1 = P_final * (-1)^(L+1). So rearranged, P_final = (-1)^(L+1 +1) ? No, wait, let me re-arrange the equation.

Wait, 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L → 1 = P_final * (-1)^(L+1). So moving everything to one side, P_final = (-1)^(L +1 + 1) ? No, wait, let's solve for P_final.

P_final = 1 / [ (-1) * (-1)^L ] * P_X? Hmm, maybe better to re-express:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^L_X.

So 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = - P_final (-1)^L_X → P_final = (-1)^(L_X +1).

Because 1 = - P_final (-1)^L_X → P_final = (-1)^(L_X +1) * (-1) → Wait, let me do it again.

Let me write the equation: 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = P_final * (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, solving for P_final, we get P_final = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ] → which is (-1)^{L_X +1} * (-1)^{something?}.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's take the equation:

1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^L_X → 1 = P_final * (-1)^{L_X +1}.

So, P_final = 1 / [ (-1)^{L_X +1} } ] → which is (-1)^{ -(L_X +1)} ) → which is same as (-1)^{ L_X +1 } because (-1)^{-n} = (-1)^n.

So P_final = [ (-1)^{ L_X +1 } ].

Another way: P_final = (-1)^{ L_X +1 }.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider the possible values of L_X and see what P_final comes out to be, and then see how it relates to the final state's L.

Wait, the final state's L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' system. The parity of that state is P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state.

So, from the parity conservation equation, we have:

P_final = (-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{ L_X +1 }.

Which implies that L_NN' ≡ L_X + 1 mod 2. So L_NN' and L_X must have opposite parity.

So, L_NN' is even if L_X is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the problem also gives us that in the final state, the NN' system has T=0. And from earlier, we have that for the final state, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So, S + L must be odd.

Now, the initial state is NN in 1S0, so S =0, L=0, J=0.

When the particle X is emitted, the NN' system will have some new S' (spin), L' (orbital), and J', which must satisfy the conservation laws.

Wait, but the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN' system would change depending on how X is emitted.

Wait, but the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0. The final state's angular momentum J_final must be the vector sum of the NN' system's J' and X's angular momentum J_X. But this can get complicated because angular momentum is a vector quantity.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at each option and see which one doesn't satisfy the conditions.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Each of these options describes the transition to a new NN state plus the particle X. The letters after the plus signs (p, s, f) are the angular momentum states of X, which correspond to l=1 (p), l=0 (s), l=3 (f)?

Wait, no, the letters correspond to the orbital angular momentum of X. So 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc. So the emitted X in each option has l equal to the letter's l value.

So in option A, X is a 'p' → l=1.

Option B: X is 'p' → l=1.

Option C: X is 'f' → l=3.

Option D: X is 's' → l=0.

Wait, but the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. How does the intrinsic parity relate to the particle's l and spin? For a spin-0 particle, the intrinsic parity is (-1)^L where L is the orbital angular momentum in the rest frame. For example, pions (which are spin-0) have parity -1, so their orbital angular momentum must be such that (-1)^L = -1 → L=1, 3, etc. But in the decay, the orbital angular momentum is the relative angular momentum in the emission process, which might be different from the particle's own orbital angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, but the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So regardless of the emission process, X's parity is -1. So the parity conservation equation must hold: P_initial * P_X = (-1)^L_X * P_final.

Wait, earlier I thought P_initial = 1, P_X = -1, so 1 = (-1) * (-1)^L_X * P_final → 1 = (-1)^{L_X + 1} * P_final → So P_final = (-1)^{L_X +1}.

But P_final is the parity of the final NN state, which is (-1)^{L_NN'}, where L_NN' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state.

Thus, (-1)^{L_NN'} = (-1)^{L_X +1} → L_NN' ≡ L_X +1 mod 2.

So L_NN' and L_X have opposite parity.

Now, the final state for each option has a given L.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (since D is l=2) → L_NN' =2.

X is p → l=1 → L_X=1.

So L_NN' is 2, which is even. L_X is 1, which is odd. So L_NN' = L_X +1 → 2 = 1 +1 → 2=2. Yes, that works.

Also, we have the condition that S + L ≡1 mod 2 in the final state.

In the final state, the spin S is part of the term symbol. Let's see:

Option A: 7D1 is (2S'+1) D^1 → the term symbol is (2S'+1)L^J.

Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So for 7D1, the 7 means (2S'+1)=7 → S'=3, since 2*3+1=7.

L is D, which is l=2.

So in the final state, S' =3, L'=2.

So S + L = 3+2=5 → 5 mod 2 is 1 → which satisfies the condition S+L ≡1 mod 2. So this is allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → (2S'+1) =3 → S'=1.

L is S → l=0.

So S' =1, L' =0.

S + L =1 +0=1 → mod 2 is 1. So condition is satisfied.

Now, X is p → l=1. So L_X=1.

L_NN' is 0 (since L'=0 from 3S1). So 0 ≡ L_X +1 mod 2 → 0 ≡ (1 +1) mod2 → 0 ≡0 mod2. So yes, parity is conserved.

But wait, let me double-check the parity part.

In option B, L_NN' is 0, L_X is 1.

So from the equation: L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 0 =1 +1 mod2 → 0=0. Correct.

So condition is satisfied. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L is D → l=2.

So S + L =1+2=3 → mod2 is 1. Condition satisfied.

X is f → l=3.

So L_X=3.

L_NN' is 2.

So L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 2 =3 +1 mod2 → 2=4 mod2 → 2=0. 4 mod2 is 0, so 2 mod2 is 0. So 0=0 → correct.

So parity condition holds.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

L is P → l=1.

So S + L =1+1=2 → mod2 is 0. Which doesn't satisfy the condition S+L ≡1 mod2. So this would make the condition T = S + L +1 mod2 → T = 0 +1 +1=2 mod2=0 → which is correct, but wait the condition is given as T= S + L +1 mod2, and T is 0.

Wait, wait, in the final state, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So if S + L is 2 (mod2: 0), then T=0+1=1 mod2. But the problem states that T is 0. So this would be a problem. So the final state in option D would have T=1, which violates the given condition that T=0.

Wait, but let me check the initial setup again.

The problem states that the final state has T=0. So the condition is 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1. Sum is 2 → mod2 is 0. So condition is not met. Thus, option D's state would have T=(0 + L +1) mod2 = (0 +1 +1)=0 mod2=0? Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express the condition.

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So if S + L is 0 mod2, then T = 0 +1=1 mod2. But in the problem, T=0. So this would make the condition 0 ≡1 mod2, which isn't true. Thus, option D's final state can't have T=0 because S+L is even, leading to T=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's calculate T for each option.

For the final state in each option:

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → 5 mod2=1. So T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → T=0. Correct.

Option B: S=1, L=0 →1+0=1→ T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

Option C: S=1, L=2 →1+2=3→3 mod2=1 → T=1+1=2 mod2=0 → correct.

Option D: S=1, L=1 →1+1=2→ mod2=0 → T=0+1=1 mod2=1. But the problem states T=0. So option D's final state would have T=1, which is not allowed. So this transition is prohibited because it would result in T=1, which doesn't match T=0.

Wait, but the problem says that the final state has T=0, so any option that leads to T=1 is invalid. So option D's transition would lead to T=1, which isn't allowed. Thus, option D is not permitted.

Wait, but let me confirm the parity condition for option D.

X is 's' → l=0.

So L_X=0.

In option D, the final state has L_NN' =1 (since it's P, l=1).

So from parity condition: L_NN' = L_X +1 mod2 → 1 =0 +1 → 1=1 → correct.

So parity is conserved, but the isospin condition isn't met. So the transition in option D leads to a state with T=1, which violates the given T=0. So this transition is forbidden.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. Each option describes a different partial wave emitted. So the forbidden one is the one that doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options describe the initial state (1S0) transitioning into a new state plus X. So the forbidden transition is the one where the final NN state doesn't satisfy the given T=0 condition.

So, the correct answer is option D, because it leads to T=1, which isn't allowed.


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in the 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), and the Pauli exclusion principle requires that \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). This implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) for the final state. Additionally, parity conservation must be satisfied, which relates the parity of the initial and final states through the emitted particle X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State (1S0):**  
   - \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), \( J = 0 \), and parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = +1 \).

2. **Final State Conditions:**  
   - \( T(NN) = 0 \), so \( S(NN) + L(NN) \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).  
   - Parity conservation: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^{L_X} \), where \( P_X = -1 \) (given) and \( L_X \) is the orbital angular momentum of X.

   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \) and \( P_X = -1 \), the parity conservation equation becomes:  
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_X} \implies P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1}.
   \]  
   The parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L_{NN}} \), so:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{NN}} = (-1)^{L_X + 1} \implies L_{NN} \equiv L_X + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

3. **Analysis of Each Option:**  
   Each option describes a transition from 1S0 to a final NN state plus a particle X with a specific angular momentum state (denoted by the lowercase letter). The angular momentum \( L_X \) is determined by the letter:  
   - \( p \to L_X = 1 \),  
   - \( s \to L_X = 0 \),  
   - \( f \to L_X = 3 \).

   For each option, we check the final NN state's \( S \) and \( L \), verify the isospin condition \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), and ensure parity conservation.

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     - Final state: \( 7D1 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 7 \implies S' = 3 \), and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D corresponds to \( l = 2 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 1 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 2 = 1 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3S1 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 0 \) (S corresponds to \( l = 0 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 1 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 0 = 1 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3D3 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 2 \) (D corresponds to \( l = 2 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), satisfying the isospin condition.  
     - \( L_X = 3 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 2 = 3 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - **Allowed.**

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     - Final state: \( 3P0 \), where \( (2S'+1) = 3 \implies S' = 1 \), and \( L_{NN} = 1 \) (P corresponds to \( l = 1 \)).  
     - \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), which does not satisfy the isospin condition \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \).  
     - Additionally, \( L_X = 0 \), so \( L_{NN} = L_X + 1 \implies 1 = 0 + 1 \), parity is conserved.  
     - However, the isospin condition is violated, making this transition **not permitted**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave not permitted is the one described in **Option D** because it violates the isospin condition \( T(NN) = 0 \). 

Answer: D
