Alright, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a substituent. The reaction is with excess bromine, and it's assumed only one monobromo derivative forms. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Hmm, I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think.

Let me list out each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So, when bromine adds, it'll go para to the methyl group.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Oh wait, no, the substituent here is COOEt, which is an ester group. Ester is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). So, it should be a meta director. So, the bromine would add meta to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is attached as a substituent. Chlorine is a bit tricky. It's a deactivating group (because of the electronegativity) but ortho/para director. So, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will go to ortho or para positions relative to Cl.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the bromine will add meta to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Wait, no, the substituent here is ethyl. Like the first one, ethyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So bromine would add para to the ethyl group.

6) C6H5-COOH: The substituent is a carboxylic acid group. COOH is a strong deactivating group (because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH group), so it's a meta director. So, bromine would add meta to the COOH.

Wait, wait. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each substituent, how much of the product is para?

I think when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the major product will be para, but depending on steric factors, sometimes ortho can be less favored. For example, bulky groups might lead to more para because the ortho positions are crowded.

But in this question, perhaps that's not too important because we're assuming only one product, but the para might be the major product when the substituent is ortho/para directing.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to either ortho, para, or meta. Since only one product is formed, but for each case, whether the substituent is activating or deactivating determines the position.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about each case:

1) CH3 substitution: Activating, so the ring is activated. The incoming Br+ will attack para to CH3.

So, the product will be para-bromotoluene. So, the para isomer is the major one.

2) COOEt: Deactivating, meta director. So, the bromine will add meta to the ester group. So the product is meta-bromo ester.

3) Cl: Deactivating, but ortho/para director. So, the product will be a mix of ortho and para bromochlorobenzene. But in this case, the question says only one product is formed. Hmmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so perhaps the substituent directs to multiple positions, but due to steric or other factors, only one is formed. Or maybe the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but in reality, chlorobenzene bromination gives a mix of ortho, meta, and para, but here the question says only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible? Or maybe it's a meta director, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. For substituent 3, Cl is ortho/para director. So, substitution in either ortho or para positions. When you brominate chlorobenzene, you get a mixture of ortho and para. But the question says only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps in this case, the substituent leads to only one product. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the substituent affects the possibility. Wait, perhaps in some cases, if the substituent is bulky, the ortho position is hindered. For example, a bulky substituent would favor para substitution.

So, for substituent 3, Cl is not that bulky, so the product would be a mix, but the question says only one monobromo is formed. Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that each substituent directs to only one position, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the major product, perhaps the para is the major one.

Wait, the question is about the 'weight fraction of the para-isomer'. So for each case, what is the percentage of para isomer in the product.

So let me think about each substituent:

1) CH3: o/p director. The major product is para, perhaps more so than ortho. But in reality, for toluene, the para isomer is major, and ortho is minor because of steric hindrance. So in this case, the para fraction is high.

2) COOEt: meta director. So the product will be meta isomer. So para is 0%.

3) Cl: o/p director. So the product is a mix of ortho and para. Which is more? I think para is a major product because steric hindrance is less in para. So the para fraction is higher than in substituent 1. Or wait, wait, no. For chlorobenzene bromination, the ortho and para positions are possible. The para isomer is more favored, so the weight fraction for para is higher than ortho. So substituent 3 would have a higher para yield than substituent 1?

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent in 1 is CH3, which is an activating group. The ring is more reactive, and the substituent directs para. In chlorobenzene (substituent 3), the substituent is deactivating but o/p directing. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major product is para-bromo chlorobenzene, with some ortho. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than in substituent 1? Or lower?

Wait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para substitution is favored because the methyl group is an activating, o/p director, and the para position is more favored than ortho because it's less crowded. Similarly, in chlorobenzene (Cl substituent), para is also major.

Wait, but methyl is an activating group, so the ring is more reactive. Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But in the case of substitution, the directing effect is more important.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups give higher yields in ortho and para, but the deactivating groups give lower yields, but still direct to o/p or meta.

Wait, perhaps for substituent 3, Cl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. But since it's an o/p director, the para is the major product, but less so than in activating groups.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about each substituent's effect on para-isomer yield:

Substituent 1: CH3 (activating, o/p), so para is major. So high para yield.

Substituent 2: COOEt (deactivating, meta), so para is 0%.

Substituent 3: Cl (deactivating, o/p), so para is major, but in chlorobenzene, the major product is para, but perhaps less than in toluene because the ring is less reactive.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So in substituent 3, Cl is o/p, so the product is mostly para. So substituent 3 has a higher para fraction than substituent 2 and 4 and 6, but perhaps lower than substituent 1 and 5.

Substituent 4: NO2 (deactivating, meta). So para is 0%.

Substituent 5: C2H5 (activating, o/p), so para is major. Maybe similar to substituent 1.

Substituent 6: COOH (deactivating, meta), so para is 0%.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 6 is COOH. COOH is a strong deactivating groupâ€”it's a meta director. So the product would be meta, so para is 0%.

So, let's list for each substituent their para yield (as a percentage, roughly):

1) CH3 (activating, o/p): para is major, say 70-80%? Or perhaps even higher.
2) COOEt (deactivating, meta): 0% para.
3) Cl (deactivating, o/p): major product is para, maybe around 60% or so?
4) NO2 (deactivating, meta): 0% para.
5) C2H5 (activating, o/p): para is major, like substituent 1, maybe around 70%?
6) COOH (deactivating, meta): 0% para.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 3 is Cl. When you have Cl as a substituent, the ring is deactivating, but o/p directing. So, when you brominate, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. But because the ring is less reactive, the rate is lower, but the para is still the major product.

So substituent 3 would have a higher para yield than substituents 2, 4, and 6, but lower than substituents 1 and 5.

Wait, but substituent 1 and 5 are both activating. So, which is more activating? The methyl group (CH3) is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. Similarly, ethyl is also activating. I think they are both activating, so they both direct to para. So substituent 1 and 5 would have high para fractions.

But wait, the question is about the order of their weight fractions. So, from lowest to highest.

Wait, let's list each substituent with their para fraction:

1) CH3: high
2) COOEt: 0
3) Cl: medium/high (since it's o/p)
4) NO2: 0
5) C2H5: high
6) COOH: 0

Wait, but what about substituents 1 and 5? Are their para fractions the same? Or do their substituents affect the para yield differently?

Wait, methyl and ethyl are both activating, o/p directors. So, in bromination, both would produce a major para product. But maybe the substituent's size affects the ratio. For example, a larger substituent, like ethyl, might have more steric hindrance, making the ortho product less favored, thus increasing the para fraction. So substituent 5 (ethyl) might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl). Or it could be the opposite.

Wait, when the substituent is larger, the ortho positions are more hindered, so the para becomes the major product. Methyl is smaller, so maybe ortho is less hindered, so perhaps the para fraction is a bit lower than with ethyl.

Wait, no. Wait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para substitution is major because the methyl group is small enough that the ortho positions are accessible but less favored due to steric factors compared to the para. But in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho substitution is even more hindered, leading to a higher para fraction.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. For toluene (methyl), the para product is about 58% and ortho about 25% (I think, but not exactly sure). For ethylbenzene, the para product is higher, maybe around 65%. So substituent 5 (ethyl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl).

So, substituent 5 has higher para yield than substituent 1.

Now, let's arrange all substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

The substituents with 0% para are 2,4,6.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) has some para fraction, then substituent 1, and substituent 5 has the highest.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but o/p. So, the para fraction would be higher than substituent 1 (CH3) if the ring's reactivity affects the ratio. But wait, Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs.

Wait, but wait. The yield isn't just about where it substitutes but also about the rate. However, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, not the overall reaction rate.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is perhaps higher than substituent 1's? Let me think.

Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the product is mainly para-bromo chlorobenzene, with some ortho. The para fraction is around 55-60%? Or is it higher?

Wait, I think that in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is the major product, perhaps around 60-70%? And in toluene, the para isomer is about 58% (I remember that toluene's bromination gives para as major, but the exact percentage I'm not certain about).

So, substituent 3 (Cl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3), which is about 58%? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than substituent 1, because Cl is deactivating. Hmm, but Cl is o/p director, so the para would be major regardless.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the order of the weight fraction of para isomer.

Let me make a list:

Substituent | Para Yield
--- | ---
1) CH3 | High (maybe 50-60%)
2) COOEt | 0%
3) Cl | High (maybe 60%+)
4) NO2 | 0%
5) C2H5 | Higher than 1 (maybe 60-70%)
6) COOH | 0%

So, in order of increasing para fraction:

2 and 4 and 6 have 0% â†’ lowest.

Then, substituent 1 has about 50-60%, next.

Substituent 3 has higher than substituent 1, say 60-70%.

Substituent 5 has higher than substituent 3, say 70%.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) has a deactivating group, which might make the ring less reactive, but the major product is still para.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than substituent 1, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I need to get the actual order of directing effects.

Wait, another approach: the substituents can be categorized into whether they are activating or deactivating.

Activating groups are more reactive, so their substitution reactions are more likely to occur, and they direct to o/p positions. Deactivating groups make the ring less reactive but can still direct.

So, substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5) are activating or deactivating? Wait, Cl is deactivating because it's an EWG, but it's o/p director. CH3 and C2H5 are activating.

So, substituents 1 and 5 are activating, o/p directors. Substituent 3 is deactivating, o/p director.

Substituents 2,4,6 are deactivating, meta directors.

So, for substituents 1,3,5: they are o/p directors, leading to some para product.

Substituents 2,4,6: meta directors, no para product.

So, the order of increasing para fraction would be from substituents with 0% to higher.

So, the substituents with 0% are 2,4,6.

Then, substituent 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5) have some para.

But which of these have higher para fractions?

I think that substituent 1 and 5 (activating) have higher para fractions than substituent 3 (which is deactivating).

Because even though substituent 3 directs to o/p, the deactivation makes the ring less reactive, which might lead to lower overall substitution but the same directing.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, not the total yield.

So, perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para fraction is about 60%, while in toluene, it's around 58%, and in ethylbenzene, higher, say 70%.

If that's the case, substituent 5 (ethyl) has higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl). Substituent 3 (Cl) has about 60%, which is higher than substituent 1.

So the order of para fractions:

2 (0) < 4 (0) < 6 (0) < 1 (58%) < 3 (60%) < 5 (70%).

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating, so perhaps its para fraction is less than substituent 1 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Chlorobenzene's bromination gives major product as para-bromochlorobenzene, with some ortho. The percentages vary, but I think the para is around 50-60%. Toluene's bromination gives para as major, around 58% (or 60?). Ethylbenzene's bromination gives para as major, but with higher percentage because ethyl is bulkier, so ortho is less favored.

So, substituent 5 (ethyl) has highest para, substituent 1 (methyl) next, substituent 3 (Cl) perhaps lower than 1.

So, the order would be substituent 3 has higher para than substituent 1?

Wait, no. Wait, I think that in ethylbenzene, the para is higher than in toluene because the substituent is bulkier, making para more favored.

So, substituent 5 has higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But what about substituent 3 (Cl) compared to 1 and 5?

Since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent is o/p directing. So, the para fraction is still higher but perhaps not as high as the activating groups.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1 and 5.

So, the order from least to most para fraction:

Substituents with 0% (2,4,6) â†’ next substituent 3 â†’ then 1 â†’ then 5.

Wait, but substituent 3 has a higher para fraction than substituent 1?

No, I think substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck. Perhaps I should think about the options provided.

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B) 6<2<4<5<1<3

C) 4<6<2<1<5<3

D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the first in the order has the least para, the last has the most.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

So, substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para. Then comes 3 (Cl) which has some para, then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

But if substituent 5 has higher para than substituent 1, then substituent 1 comes before substituent 5. So in option A, substituent 1 is before 5, which would be correct if substituent 5 has higher para than 1. So substituent 1 is before 5 in the increasing order.

Wait, no. Let me see. If substituent 5 has higher para than 1, then when the order is from low to high, substituent 1 comes before 5.

So in option A, the order is 4 (0), 2 (0),6 (0), 3 (some), 1 (some),5 (higher). So in this case, substituent 1 has higher para than substituent 3? Or lower?

Hmm, maybe substituent 3 (Cl) has less para than substituent 1. Let me think: Cl is deactivating, so even though it's o/p directing, the para fraction might be lower than in activating groups.

So substituent 3 (Cl) would have less para than substituent 1 and 5.

So substituent 3 comes after substituents 2,4,6 but before substituents 1 and 5.

So, the order would be substituents with 0% â†’ then substituent 3 â†’ then substituent 1 â†’ substituent 5 (since it has the highest para).

So the order would be: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none exactly match this.

Let me look at each option.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ So 4, 2,6 (0), then 3, 1,5.

So substituent 3 is after 2,4,6. So in this option, substituent 3 comes before 1 and 5. If substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 1 and 5, then this option would make sense. But I thought substituent 5's para is higher than substituent 1.

Wait, another approach: think about the substituent's activating/deactivating and steric effects.

Wait, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is a larger group than methyl. So, in ethylbenzene, the para substitution is more favored because the ethyl group is bulkier, making the ortho substitution more hindered. So substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

So, substituent 5 has higher para fraction than substituent 1.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the para fraction may be lower than substituent 1.

So, the order of para fractions is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (Cl) < substituent 1 (CH3) < substituent5 (C2H5).

So, the order from least to most para is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So in option A, substituents 4,2,6 (all 0%) come first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order would be 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) has some para, but lower than substituent 1 and 5. So, the correct order would be substituents 2,4,6 (0%) have the least, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So in terms of the options, option A has substituents 4, 2,6 followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

So the increasing order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, but why are 4,2,6 in that particular order? Because they all have 0% para, their order among themselves might not matter, but according to the options, the order is 4, then 2, then 6.

But in reality, since they all are 0, their order is irrelevant for the purpose of this question. So any order among them would be acceptable.

So the correct overall order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent3 < substituent1 < substituent5.

Looking at the options, option A is the only one that orders the 0% first, then 3, then 1, then 5. So the option A would be 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But wait, another thought: substituent 3 is Cl, which is an electron-withdrawing group but still o/p director. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major product is para, but the ring is deactivated, so perhaps the para fraction is lower than in toluene.

So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

Thus, the order from least para to most would be substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent3 < substituent1 < substituent5.

So the correct order is 2,4,6 <3<1<5.

But looking at the options, which one reflects that?

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ so substituents 4,2,6 are first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But substituent3 is after 4, 2,6, but before 1 and 5.

So that would fit the order we have.

Wait, but in option A, substituent 4 comes first, but substituent 4 is NO2, which is a meta director. So it's the same as substituents 2 and 6 in having 0% para.

So the order among substituents 2,4,6 doesn't matter, as their para is 0.

So, the correct arrangement is substituents 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is the only one that has substituent 5 as the last, which is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating (ortho/para directors) or deactivating (meta directors), and their electronic and steric effects influence the yield of the para-isomer.

### Analysis of Each Substituent:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.  
   - Para fraction: High (~58%).

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Deactivating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product, but the yield is lower than in activating groups due to the deactivating nature of chlorine.  
   - Para fraction: Medium (~60%).

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product, and due to steric hindrance, the yield of the para-isomer is higher than in toluene.  
   - Para fraction: High (~70%).

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

### Order of Increasing Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer:
- Substituents with 0% para-isomer: **2 (COC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)**.  
- Substituent with medium para-isomer: **3 (Cl)**.  
- Substituents with high para-isomer: **1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)**.  
- Final order: **2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A

Alright, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to a substituent. The reaction is with excess bromine, and it's assumed only one monobromo derivative forms. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Hmm, I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, sometimes it's the other way around. Let me think.

Let me list out each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So, when bromine adds, it'll go para to the methyl group.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Oh wait, no, the substituent here is COOEt, which is an ester group. Ester is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). So, it should be a meta director. So, the bromine would add meta to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is attached as a substituent. Chlorine is a bit tricky. It's a deactivating group (because of the electronegativity) but ortho/para director. So, the incoming electrophile (Br+) will go to ortho or para positions relative to Cl.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the bromine will add meta to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: Wait, no, the substituent here is ethyl. Like the first one, ethyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So bromine would add para to the ethyl group.

6) C6H5-COOH: The substituent is a carboxylic acid group. COOH is a strong deactivating group (because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH group), so it's a meta director. So, bromine would add meta to the COOH.

Wait, wait. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So, for each substituent, how much of the product is para?

I think when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the major product will be para, but depending on steric factors, sometimes ortho can be less favored. For example, bulky groups might lead to more para because the ortho positions are crowded.

But in this question, perhaps that's not too important because we're assuming only one product, but the para might be the major product when the substituent is ortho/para directing.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So, perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to either ortho, para, or meta. Since only one product is formed, but for each case, whether the substituent is activating or deactivating determines the position.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about each case:

1) CH3 substitution: Activating, so the ring is activated. The incoming Br+ will attack para to CH3.

So, the product will be para-bromotoluene. So, the para isomer is the major one.

2) COOEt: Deactivating, meta director. So, the bromine will add meta to the ester group. So the product is meta-bromo ester.

3) Cl: Deactivating, but ortho/para director. So, the product will be a mix of ortho and para bromochlorobenzene. But in this case, the question says only one product is formed. Hmmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed, so perhaps the substituent directs to multiple positions, but due to steric or other factors, only one is formed. Or maybe the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but in reality, chlorobenzene bromination gives a mix of ortho, meta, and para, but here the question says only one monobromo is formed. So perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible? Or maybe it's a meta director, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. For substituent 3, Cl is ortho/para director. So, substitution in either ortho or para positions. When you brominate chlorobenzene, you get a mixture of ortho and para. But the question says only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps in this case, the substituent leads to only one product. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the substituent affects the possibility. Wait, perhaps in some cases, if the substituent is bulky, the ortho position is hindered. For example, a bulky substituent would favor para substitution.

So, for substituent 3, Cl is not that bulky, so the product would be a mix, but the question says only one monobromo is formed. Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that each substituent directs to only one position, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the major product, perhaps the para is the major one.

Wait, the question is about the 'weight fraction of the para-isomer'. So for each case, what is the percentage of para isomer in the product.

So let me think about each substituent:

1) CH3: o/p director. The major product is para, perhaps more so than ortho. But in reality, for toluene, the para isomer is major, and ortho is minor because of steric hindrance. So in this case, the para fraction is high.

2) COOEt: meta director. So the product will be meta isomer. So para is 0%.

3) Cl: o/p director. So the product is a mix of ortho and para. Which is more? I think para is a major product because steric hindrance is less in para. So the para fraction is higher than in substituent 1. Or wait, wait, no. For chlorobenzene bromination, the ortho and para positions are possible. The para isomer is more favored, so the weight fraction for para is higher than ortho. So substituent 3 would have a higher para yield than substituent 1?

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent in 1 is CH3, which is an activating group. The ring is more reactive, and the substituent directs para. In chlorobenzene (substituent 3), the substituent is deactivating but o/p directing. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major product is para-bromo chlorobenzene, with some ortho. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than in substituent 1? Or lower?

Wait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para substitution is favored because the methyl group is an activating, o/p director, and the para position is more favored than ortho because it's less crowded. Similarly, in chlorobenzene (Cl substituent), para is also major.

Wait, but methyl is an activating group, so the ring is more reactive. Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But in the case of substitution, the directing effect is more important.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups give higher yields in ortho and para, but the deactivating groups give lower yields, but still direct to o/p or meta.

Wait, perhaps for substituent 3, Cl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. But since it's an o/p director, the para is the major product, but less so than in activating groups.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about each substituent's effect on para-isomer yield:

Substituent 1: CH3 (activating, o/p), so para is major. So high para yield.

Substituent 2: COOEt (deactivating, meta), so para is 0%.

Substituent 3: Cl (deactivating, o/p), so para is major, but in chlorobenzene, the major product is para, but perhaps less than in toluene because the ring is less reactive.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So in substituent 3, Cl is o/p, so the product is mostly para. So substituent 3 has a higher para fraction than substituent 2 and 4 and 6, but perhaps lower than substituent 1 and 5.

Substituent 4: NO2 (deactivating, meta). So para is 0%.

Substituent 5: C2H5 (activating, o/p), so para is major. Maybe similar to substituent 1.

Substituent 6: COOH (deactivating, meta), so para is 0%.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 6 is COOH. COOH is a strong deactivating groupâ€”it's a meta director. So the product would be meta, so para is 0%.

So, let's list for each substituent their para yield (as a percentage, roughly):

1) CH3 (activating, o/p): para is major, say 70-80%? Or perhaps even higher.
2) COOEt (deactivating, meta): 0% para.
3) Cl (deactivating, o/p): major product is para, maybe around 60% or so?
4) NO2 (deactivating, meta): 0% para.
5) C2H5 (activating, o/p): para is major, like substituent 1, maybe around 70%?
6) COOH (deactivating, meta): 0% para.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 3 is Cl. When you have Cl as a substituent, the ring is deactivating, but o/p directing. So, when you brominate, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene. But because the ring is less reactive, the rate is lower, but the para is still the major product.

So substituent 3 would have a higher para yield than substituents 2, 4, and 6, but lower than substituents 1 and 5.

Wait, but substituent 1 and 5 are both activating. So, which is more activating? The methyl group (CH3) is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. Similarly, ethyl is also activating. I think they are both activating, so they both direct to para. So substituent 1 and 5 would have high para fractions.

But wait, the question is about the order of their weight fractions. So, from lowest to highest.

Wait, let's list each substituent with their para fraction:

1) CH3: high
2) COOEt: 0
3) Cl: medium/high (since it's o/p)
4) NO2: 0
5) C2H5: high
6) COOH: 0

Wait, but what about substituents 1 and 5? Are their para fractions the same? Or do their substituents affect the para yield differently?

Wait, methyl and ethyl are both activating, o/p directors. So, in bromination, both would produce a major para product. But maybe the substituent's size affects the ratio. For example, a larger substituent, like ethyl, might have more steric hindrance, making the ortho product less favored, thus increasing the para fraction. So substituent 5 (ethyl) might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl). Or it could be the opposite.

Wait, when the substituent is larger, the ortho positions are more hindered, so the para becomes the major product. Methyl is smaller, so maybe ortho is less hindered, so perhaps the para fraction is a bit lower than with ethyl.

Wait, no. Wait, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para substitution is major because the methyl group is small enough that the ortho positions are accessible but less favored due to steric factors compared to the para. But in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is bulkier, so ortho substitution is even more hindered, leading to a higher para fraction.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. For toluene (methyl), the para product is about 58% and ortho about 25% (I think, but not exactly sure). For ethylbenzene, the para product is higher, maybe around 65%. So substituent 5 (ethyl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl).

So, substituent 5 has higher para yield than substituent 1.

Now, let's arrange all substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

The substituents with 0% para are 2,4,6.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) has some para fraction, then substituent 1, and substituent 5 has the highest.

Wait, no. Wait, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but o/p. So, the para fraction would be higher than substituent 1 (CH3) if the ring's reactivity affects the ratio. But wait, Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs.

Wait, but wait. The yield isn't just about where it substitutes but also about the rate. However, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, not the overall reaction rate.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is perhaps higher than substituent 1's? Let me think.

Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the product is mainly para-bromo chlorobenzene, with some ortho. The para fraction is around 55-60%? Or is it higher?

Wait, I think that in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is the major product, perhaps around 60-70%? And in toluene, the para isomer is about 58% (I remember that toluene's bromination gives para as major, but the exact percentage I'm not certain about).

So, substituent 3 (Cl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3), which is about 58%? Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than substituent 1, because Cl is deactivating. Hmm, but Cl is o/p director, so the para would be major regardless.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the order of the weight fraction of para isomer.

Let me make a list:

Substituent | Para Yield
--- | ---
1) CH3 | High (maybe 50-60%)
2) COOEt | 0%
3) Cl | High (maybe 60%+)
4) NO2 | 0%
5) C2H5 | Higher than 1 (maybe 60-70%)
6) COOH | 0%

So, in order of increasing para fraction:

2 and 4 and 6 have 0% â†’ lowest.

Then, substituent 1 has about 50-60%, next.

Substituent 3 has higher than substituent 1, say 60-70%.

Substituent 5 has higher than substituent 3, say 70%.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) has a deactivating group, which might make the ring less reactive, but the major product is still para.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 has a lower para fraction than substituent 1, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I need to get the actual order of directing effects.

Wait, another approach: the substituents can be categorized into whether they are activating or deactivating.

Activating groups are more reactive, so their substitution reactions are more likely to occur, and they direct to o/p positions. Deactivating groups make the ring less reactive but can still direct.

So, substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5) are activating or deactivating? Wait, Cl is deactivating because it's an EWG, but it's o/p director. CH3 and C2H5 are activating.

So, substituents 1 and 5 are activating, o/p directors. Substituent 3 is deactivating, o/p director.

Substituents 2,4,6 are deactivating, meta directors.

So, for substituents 1,3,5: they are o/p directors, leading to some para product.

Substituents 2,4,6: meta directors, no para product.

So, the order of increasing para fraction would be from substituents with 0% to higher.

So, the substituents with 0% are 2,4,6.

Then, substituent 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5) have some para.

But which of these have higher para fractions?

I think that substituent 1 and 5 (activating) have higher para fractions than substituent 3 (which is deactivating).

Because even though substituent 3 directs to o/p, the deactivation makes the ring less reactive, which might lead to lower overall substitution but the same directing.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, not the total yield.

So, perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para fraction is about 60%, while in toluene, it's around 58%, and in ethylbenzene, higher, say 70%.

If that's the case, substituent 5 (ethyl) has higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl). Substituent 3 (Cl) has about 60%, which is higher than substituent 1.

So the order of para fractions:

2 (0) < 4 (0) < 6 (0) < 1 (58%) < 3 (60%) < 5 (70%).

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating, so perhaps its para fraction is less than substituent 1 and 5.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Chlorobenzene's bromination gives major product as para-bromochlorobenzene, with some ortho. The percentages vary, but I think the para is around 50-60%. Toluene's bromination gives para as major, around 58% (or 60?). Ethylbenzene's bromination gives para as major, but with higher percentage because ethyl is bulkier, so ortho is less favored.

So, substituent 5 (ethyl) has highest para, substituent 1 (methyl) next, substituent 3 (Cl) perhaps lower than 1.

So, the order would be substituent 3 has higher para than substituent 1?

Wait, no. Wait, I think that in ethylbenzene, the para is higher than in toluene because the substituent is bulkier, making para more favored.

So, substituent 5 has higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But what about substituent 3 (Cl) compared to 1 and 5?

Since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent is o/p directing. So, the para fraction is still higher but perhaps not as high as the activating groups.

So, substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1 and 5.

So, the order from least to most para fraction:

Substituents with 0% (2,4,6) â†’ next substituent 3 â†’ then 1 â†’ then 5.

Wait, but substituent 3 has a higher para fraction than substituent 1?

No, I think substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck. Perhaps I should think about the options provided.

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B) 6<2<4<5<1<3

C) 4<6<2<1<5<3

D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the first in the order has the least para, the last has the most.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5

So, substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para. Then comes 3 (Cl) which has some para, then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

But if substituent 5 has higher para than substituent 1, then substituent 1 comes before substituent 5. So in option A, substituent 1 is before 5, which would be correct if substituent 5 has higher para than 1. So substituent 1 is before 5 in the increasing order.

Wait, no. Let me see. If substituent 5 has higher para than 1, then when the order is from low to high, substituent 1 comes before 5.

So in option A, the order is 4 (0), 2 (0),6 (0), 3 (some), 1 (some),5 (higher). So in this case, substituent 1 has higher para than substituent 3? Or lower?

Hmm, maybe substituent 3 (Cl) has less para than substituent 1. Let me think: Cl is deactivating, so even though it's o/p directing, the para fraction might be lower than in activating groups.

So substituent 3 (Cl) would have less para than substituent 1 and 5.

So substituent 3 comes after substituents 2,4,6 but before substituents 1 and 5.

So, the order would be substituents with 0% â†’ then substituent 3 â†’ then substituent 1 â†’ substituent 5 (since it has the highest para).

So the order would be: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none exactly match this.

Let me look at each option.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ So 4, 2,6 (0), then 3, 1,5.

So substituent 3 is after 2,4,6. So in this option, substituent 3 comes before 1 and 5. If substituent 3's para fraction is higher than 1 and 5, then this option would make sense. But I thought substituent 5's para is higher than substituent 1.

Wait, another approach: think about the substituent's activating/deactivating and steric effects.

Wait, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is a larger group than methyl. So, in ethylbenzene, the para substitution is more favored because the ethyl group is bulkier, making the ortho substitution more hindered. So substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1.

So, substituent 5 has higher para fraction than substituent 1.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the para fraction may be lower than substituent 1.

So, the order of para fractions is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (Cl) < substituent 1 (CH3) < substituent5 (C2H5).

So, the order from least to most para is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So in option A, substituents 4,2,6 (all 0%) come first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So the order would be 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) has some para, but lower than substituent 1 and 5. So, the correct order would be substituents 2,4,6 (0%) have the least, then 3, then 1, then 5.

So in terms of the options, option A has substituents 4, 2,6 followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

So the increasing order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, but why are 4,2,6 in that particular order? Because they all have 0% para, their order among themselves might not matter, but according to the options, the order is 4, then 2, then 6.

But in reality, since they all are 0, their order is irrelevant for the purpose of this question. So any order among them would be acceptable.

So the correct overall order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent3 < substituent1 < substituent5.

Looking at the options, option A is the only one that orders the 0% first, then 3, then 1, then 5. So the option A would be 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But wait, another thought: substituent 3 is Cl, which is an electron-withdrawing group but still o/p director. So when you brominate chlorobenzene, the major product is para, but the ring is deactivated, so perhaps the para fraction is lower than in toluene.

So substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituent 1's.

Thus, the order from least para to most would be substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent3 < substituent1 < substituent5.

So the correct order is 2,4,6 <3<1<5.

But looking at the options, which one reflects that?

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ so substituents 4,2,6 are first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But substituent3 is after 4, 2,6, but before 1 and 5.

So that would fit the order we have.

Wait, but in option A, substituent 4 comes first, but substituent 4 is NO2, which is a meta director. So it's the same as substituents 2 and 6 in having 0% para.

So the order among substituents 2,4,6 doesn't matter, as their para is 0.

So, the correct arrangement is substituents 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is the only one that has substituent 5 as the last, which is correct.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating (ortho/para directors) or deactivating (meta directors), and their electronic and steric effects influence the yield of the para-isomer.

### Analysis of Each Substituent:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.  
   - Para fraction: High (~58%).

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Deactivating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product, but the yield is lower than in activating groups due to the deactivating nature of chlorine.  
   - Para fraction: Medium (~60%).

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para director.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product, and due to steric hindrance, the yield of the para-isomer is higher than in toluene.  
   - Para fraction: High (~70%).

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The bromine adds to the meta position, so the para-isomer is not formed.  
   - Para fraction: 0%.

### Order of Increasing Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer:
- Substituents with 0% para-isomer: **2 (COC2H5), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)**.  
- Substituent with medium para-isomer: **3 (Cl)**.  
- Substituents with high para-isomer: **1 (CH3), 5 (C2H5)**.  
- Final order: **2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A
