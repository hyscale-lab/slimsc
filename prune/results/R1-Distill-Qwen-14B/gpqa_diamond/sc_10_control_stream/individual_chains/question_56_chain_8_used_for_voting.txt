Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions have certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions (which I think is what this question refers to), the selection rules are Δn = 0, ±1 (but not zero, because that would mean no transition), and Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1, including zero. So l has to change by 1 each time because it's a dipole transition, which is a change in the orbital angular momentum.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, wait. The transition is happening in two steps, right? So it's going from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1, but each time the l has to change by ±1.

Wait, the initial state has l=0. So in the first transition, it needs to go to l=1. Because l can only change by ±1. So from l=0, the next possible is l=1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the first intermediate state must have l=1.

Possible options would be states with n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the first transition from |3,0,0> would go to |2,1,m>, where m is 0, ±1.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option A says it goes to |2,1,0> first, then to |1,0,0>. That makes sense because l goes from 0 to 1, then from 1 to 0. So that's allowed. But wait, what about the second transition? From l=1, can it go to l=0? Yes, because Δl= -1, which is allowed.

Now, let me think about the possible m values. The initial state is m=0. So in the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m in intermediate state is 0, -1, +1. So the first step could be m=0, m=1, or m=-1.

Looking at the options, option A's first transition is m=0. So |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>, then |2,1,0>→|1,0,0>. Option D also starts with |2,1,0>, but I'm not sure what the transition probability is.

Wait, the question is about the probability of the transition. I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the dipole selection rules. For each transition, the allowed m changes are by 0, ±1.

In the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, m can be 0, 1, or -1. So that gives three possible states. The probability for each is then based on the possible m transitions.

Wait, the probability might relate to the number of possible m changes. For the first transition, the initial m is 0. So possible m in the next state are -1, 0, +1. So three possibilities. So the probability for each would be 1/3 each? Or maybe the transition probability is more involved.

Wait, but when a transition occurs, the change in m is determined by the photon's angular momentum, which can be -1, 0, or +1. So each possible m change has a certain probability. So for each transition, the sum of probabilities must be 1.

In the first step from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So each m transition has a probability, but I think the probability depends on the square of the matrix element.

Wait, but for each transition, the allowed m changes are 0, ±1. So the total number of possible m changes is 3. But perhaps each m change has an equal probability, so each would have a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but when you go from m=0 to m=0 in the first transition, that's allowed because Δm =0. So the initial state is m=0, and the first transition could just stay at m=0. So the first transition could go to |2,1,0>.

In the second transition, from |2,1,0>, the next state must have l=0, so m has to go from 0 to 0. Because the final state is m=0. So in the second transition, the m can change by -1, 0, +1, but since the final m is 0, from initial m=0, so Δm can be -1, 0, +1. But the final m is 0, so possible Δm is 0, but wait, no. Wait, in the second transition, you're going from l=1 to l=0. So the state must go from |2,1, m1> to |1,0, 0>.

Wait, the second transition is from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>. So in this case, m must be 0, because m can't change more than ±1. Because the final m is 0, so initial m can be -1, 0, +1. Wait no, from l=1, m can be -1, 0, 1. So for the second transition, you need to go from m to 0. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, what are the allowed transitions?

Wait, no, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1, m>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So in the second transition, the m must go from m to 0. So Δm can be -m? Wait, no. The change in m is the photon's m, which is -1, 0, or 1. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, the allowed m in the final state is m + Δm.

Wait, but the final state has m=0. So the initial state's m plus Δm must equal 0. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, the allowed Δm is (0 - m).

So in the second transition, the change in m is 0 - m. So possible m's in the intermediate state are those where 0 - m is allowed, which is if |0 - m| ≤ 1. So m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but in the second transition, from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>, m must change by -1, 0, or +1.

So if the intermediate state has m=+1, then the second transition would require Δm = -1 (since 0 = m + Δm → Δm = -1). For m=0, Δm=0. For m=-1, Δm=+1.

So all three possibilities are allowed.

But for the transition probabilities, each possible m in the intermediate state (after the first transition) can lead to the final state. So the overall probability is the sum over all possible intermediate m states of the product of the probabilities of each transition.

Wait, but each transition has a certain probability. Let me think about the probabilities for each step.

The first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. The probability for each m is |<2,1,m | 3,0,0>|^2.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>, which has l=0, m=0. The matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the spherical harmonic Y_{1, m} (since the dipole operator has l=1). So the matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is proportional to <2,1,m | r |3,0,0>.

Wait, I think that r is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0} (since the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,0} or maybe a combination of Y_{1,m} with m=-1,0,+1? Wait, no, the dipole operator is a vector, so it has components in x, y, z. So the dipole transitions involve transitions where m changes by -1, 0, +1. So the matrix elements are non-zero only when m' = m + 0 (since the dipole operator in z-direction has m=0), or x and y components can change m by ±1.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me recall that for electric dipole transitions, the transition is allowed if Δl = ±1, Δn = ±1 (but n can't stay the same), and Δm = 0, ±1.

So for the first transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. So possible m transitions are m=0 → m= -1, 0, +1.

So the probability for each m would be the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or the integral involving the spherical harmonics. But perhaps in the simplest case, each m has an equal probability? Or maybe the probabilities are not the same.

Wait, no, I think the probability depends on the square of the integral. For a transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the probability is proportional to | ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_0^0 Y_{3,0} dΩ |². Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to remember that the dipole transitions have matrix elements that are non-zero only when the sum of the angular momenta allows it. So for |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the selection rule is m = 0 ± 1, but wait, wait, no. The dipole operator has l=1, so the transition is from l=0 to l=1, so m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, perhaps the transition probability is proportional to (2l+1)δ_{L=1, l'}, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think that for each possible m, the probability is the same because of symmetry. So from m=0, you can go to m= -1, 0, +1, each with equal probability. So each has a probability of 1/3.

If that's the case, then the first transition has three possible paths: m = -1, 0, +1, each with probability 1/3.

Then, for each of those, the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So for each intermediate m, the second transition's m must change by 0, ±1 to reach m=0.

Wait, but the final state is m=0, so each intermediate m can transition to m=0 if the change is allowed.

So let's consider each possible intermediate state:

1. Intermediate state |2,1,0>:

For the second transition, from m=0 to m=0. So Δm=0. So the transition is allowed. The probability for this path is (1/3) * probability of this second transition.

Wait, but what's the probability of the second transition? Let me think. The second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The probability for each such transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients as well. For each intermediate state, the transition to the final state occurs with a certain probability.

Wait, but for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So again, the dipole selection rules apply: Δl must be -1 (since going from l=1 to l=0). And Δm must be 0, ±1. So for each intermediate m, the final m is 0, so Δm is (0 - m).

So Δm can be 0, -1, +1 only if |Δm| ≤1. So for each intermediate m, the transition is allowed only if (0 - m) is in {−1, 0, +1}.

Which would mean for m = -1, 0, +1. So all intermediate states are allowed.

But the probability for each transition would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for each possible m? Or maybe it's more involved.

Wait, another approach: the total transition probability from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two steps (each step being a dipole transition) is the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each step.

So, the intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,-1>.

For each intermediate state, the probability of the first transition is P1(m), and the probability of the second transition is P2(m).

So the total probability is sum over m of P1(m) * P2(m).

But what are P1(m) and P2(m)?

Earlier, I thought P1(m) is 1/3 for each m, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for each m are not the same.

Wait, I think the transition probability for each m is proportional to |<2,1,m | r |3,0,0>|². So the matrix element is:

<2,1,m | r |3,0,0> = (something) <2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0>.

Wait, r is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0}, so the dipole operator in the z-direction is proportional to Y_{1,0}, so the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The dipole transition is governed by the operator r Y_{1,m}, perhaps. So for each component of the dipole, you have Y_{1,-1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}.

So for each dipole component, the matrix element is non-zero only when the initial state's m plus the dipole's m equals the final state's m. So for the z-component (Y_{1,0}), the matrix element is non-zero when m' = m_initial + 0, so m'=m_initial. So the initial state |3,0,0> has m=0, so the transition via Y_{1,0} would give m'=0 in the final state. For the x and y components, which involve Y_{1, ±1}, the transitions would allow m' = m_initial ±1.

Wait, so the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to m = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |3,0,0> can go to |2,1, m> where m = -1, 0, +1, each via a different component of the dipole operator.

Since each component contributes equally, perhaps each m has an equal probability. So for the first transition, each m has a probability of 1/3.

If that's the case, then the first transition's probabilities are 1/3 for each m=−1, 0, +1.

Now, for each m in the intermediate state, the second transition's probability is calculated similarly.

In the second transition, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the dipole operator again allows m to change by -1, 0, +1. So for each intermediate m, what's the allowed Δm to reach the final m=0.

So let's consider each case:

1. Intermediate state |2,1,1>:

To reach |1,0,0>, m must go from 1 → 0. So Δm = -1. So this transition is allowed, and the dipole component that causes this is Y_{1,−1}.

2. Intermediate state |2,1,0>:

Δm = 0. So dipole component Y_{1,0}.

3. Intermediate state |2,1,−1>:

Δm = +1. So dipole component Y_{1,1}.

The probability for the second transition depends on the matrix element for each case. But since each dipole component's matrix element would be similar, perhaps each transition has the same probability. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are the same for each m.

Wait, but the matrix elements might vary. Let me think: the matrix element for Y_{1, m} is proportional to <1,0,0 | Y_{1,m} |2,1, m'>.

Wait, no, for the second transition, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the matrix element is <1,0,0 | r Y_{1, something} |2,1, m>.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has a probability of 1/3 as well. But no, because the second transition's m is fixed to 0, so the number of possible m's is 3 again? Or maybe the number of possible m's is 1, because the transition must lead to m=0.

Wait, no, in the second transition, the initial state's m can be -1, 0, +1. The final state's m is 0. So the change in m is (0 - initial m). So for each initial m, the change must be allowed (i.e., |Δm| ≤1). So for each initial m:

- If m=1: Δm = -1 → allowed.

- If m=0: Δm=0 → allowed.

- If m=-1: Δm=+1 → allowed.

So each transition is allowed, and each has a certain probability.

But what's the probability for each?

Assuming each dipole component contributes equally, the probability for the second transition from each intermediate state would be 1/3 each. But wait, no, because for each intermediate m, the allowed Δm is fixed.

Wait, perhaps each second transition (from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>) has a probability of 1/3, but that doesn't make sense because the sum over all possibilities must be 1.

Alternatively, maybe each second transition has a probability of 1/3 regardless of m. Wait, but there are three possible intermediate m's, and each transition from those has a certain probability.

Wait, maybe the probability for each second transition is 1/3 multiplied by the initial probability. But no, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition has a certain probability for each m, and the total for each first transition is the product.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has a probability of 1/3 for each m, and the second transition for each m has a probability of 1/3 as well. Then the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three paths, the total is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but that would make the total probability 1/3, which is an option in the given choices (option A is 1/3).

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Another approach: in the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>. It can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1, 0>, |2,1, 1>, each with equal probability. Then, from each of these, the probability of transitioning to |1,0,0> is the same because the dipole allows m to change by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but going from |2,1,1> to |1,0,0> requires Δm = -1, which corresponds to a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and similarly for the others.

Wait, but perhaps each second transition has a probability of 1/3 as well. So each path (like |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) would have a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But since there are three such paths, the total would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But wait, the options don't all have 1/3. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says the probability is 1/3. That's one possibility.

Option D says the probability is 2/3. Hmm, how would that happen?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that each first transition has equal probability. Perhaps the first transition doesn't have equal probabilities for m=−1, 0, +1. Because the matrix element could be different for each. For example, maybe m=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, what's the matrix element for the first transition for each m?

The transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. The matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1, m'} | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but the dipole operator in the z-direction is proportional to Y_{1,0}, so the matrix element for m'=0 would be non-zero. For m=0, the transition is allowed via Y_{1,0}. For m=+1 and -1, the transitions are allowed via Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}.

But the integral of Y_{1, m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{3,0} would determine the matrix element's magnitude.

I think that the matrix element for m=0 is larger because Y_{1,0} is real (up to a phase) and might lead to a larger overlap. Whereas for m=+1 and −1, the spherical harmonics have more nodes and perhaps smaller overlaps.

Wait, actually, the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{3,0} is zero unless certain angular momentum conditions are met. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The product Y_{1,m} Y_{3,0} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l, m'}, so the matrix element would be non-zero only when the total angular momentum adds up correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l1=1 (from Y_{1,m}) and l2=0 (from Y_{0,0}) to get L=3? Wait, that can't be. Because 1 and 0 can add up to 1, not 3. So perhaps the matrix element is zero for all m except when the combined angular momentum can reach 3.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I recall that the transition probability from |n, l, m> to |n', l', m'> is non-zero only if l' = l ±1, and |m' - m| ≤1.

But in the first transition, from l=0 to l=1, so that's allowed. For the second transition, l=1 to l=0, which is allowed.

But regarding the probabilities, perhaps only the m=0 transitions contribute, but that can't be right because the options include other possibilities.

Wait, let me think about the possible paths.

Option A says the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

Option D says the same path but with probability 2/3.

Hmm, why would the probability be 2/3?

Wait, perhaps the other options involve paths that are forbidden, making the only allowed path the one in options A and D, but with different probabilities.

Wait, for example, if the first transition can't go to |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1>, then the only possibility is m=0, making the probability for the first transition 1, and then the second transition would have a probability of 1 as well.

But wait, that's not possible because the matrix elements for m=±1 might be zero.

Wait, but when you have a transition from l=0 to l=1, m can only change by 0, ±1. So all three m transitions are allowed, but perhaps only one has a non-zero matrix element.

Which one?

Wait, perhaps the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has components Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}. So the transition can occur via any of these components.

But the matrix element for m=0 would involve the Y_{1,0} term, whereas m=+1 would involve Y_{1,1}, and m=-1 would involve Y_{1,-1}.

The integral for the matrix element <2,1,m | Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0> is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are met.

Wait, the integral of Y_{2,1,m} Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0}^* dΩ.

According to angular momentum addition rules, the product Y_{l=1, m'} Y_{l=3, m=0} must result in a state with L=2 or 4? Wait, no, because when you multiply two spherical harmonics, Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l2,m2}, the result can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l, m} where l ranges from |l1-l2| to l1+l2.

So in our case, Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} would give terms with l from 2 to 4.

The state |2,1,m> has l=2, so the integral would be non-zero only if the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} has an l=2 component.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 and l=3 to get l=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan series: 1 and 3 can couple to L=4, 2, and 0.

So the possible L values are 4, 2, 0.

Thus, the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} will have components for L=4, 2, 0.

Therefore, the integral <2,1,m | Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0> is non-zero only when L=2, which corresponds to the coupling of l1=1 and l2=3.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when the product includes the L=2 component. So the matrix element is non-zero only when L=2.

Thus, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> via Y_{1,m'} is allowed only for certain m' and m.

Wait, but m' is the m of the dipole component. So for each m', the matrix element will have a certain dependence on m.

So for m' = 0: Y_{1,0}. The product Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0} would have components for L=4, 2, 0.

So the |2,1,m> state can be reached via this component if L=2 and m=0.

The matrix element would be non-zero for m=0.

Similarly, for m' = +1: Y_{1,1}. The product Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0} will have terms for L=4, 2, 0.

So when L=2, the m would be 1 (since m1 + m2 = m' + 0 = m'). So for L=2, m can be up to 2, so m=1 is allowed.

Similarly, for m' = -1: Y_{1,-1}. The product Y_{1,-1} Y_{3,0} would lead to L=4, 2, 0. For L=2, m would be -1.

So the matrix element for each m' is non-zero only for specific m in |2,1,m>.

But wait, in the first transition, we're considering the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> via the dipole operator, which includes Y_{1, m'}.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when the combination of m' and m leads to the correct L and m.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps the only allowed transitions from |3,0,0> are to |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, and |2,1,-1>.

But I need to find the probability for each.

Perhaps the only allowed transition is for m'=0, giving m=0 in the intermediate state. Because when you have Y_{1,0} leading to m'=0, the matrix element would be non-zero for m=0. But for m'=1 and m'=-1, perhaps the matrix elements are zero.

Wait, no, because earlier I concluded that all three are allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the selection rules for dipole transitions allow m to change by 0, ±1.

So for the first transition, any m in |2,1,m> is allowed.

But the transition amplitude for each m would involve the integral of Y_{2,1,m} Y_{1, m'} Y_{3,0}^*.

But perhaps the only non-zero integral is when m' = 0 and m=0.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because Y_{2,1,0} is orthogonal to Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0}, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the integral is non-zero only when m'=0, leading to m=0.

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the first transition to m=0 is 3 times higher than for m=±1. Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 might be sqrt(3), while for m=±1 it's 1.

Wait, I remember that for certain transitions, the probabilities for m=0 are higher due to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to think of specific examples.

In hydrogen, the transition from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0 has certain probabilities for different m changes. I think that the transition from m=0 to m=0 has a higher probability than others.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for m=0 are higher than for m=±1 because of the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has a higher probability for m=0. Let's say the probability for m=0 is 3/4 and for m=±1 is 1/4 each. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are proportional to (2 - m)(2 + m), but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the possible paths and their probabilities. Suppose the only allowed intermediate states are |2,1,0>, and the others are forbidden. Then the probability would be the product of the probabilities for each step.

But the options include other possibilities.

Wait, another idea: the selection rules for the dipole transitions also require that the parity changes. The parity of the state is (-1)^l. So for a transition from l=0 (even) to l=1 (odd), the parity changes, which is allowed for a dipole transition (since dipole operator has parity -1, so even → odd is allowed).

But this doesn't directly affect the m transitions.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which says the transition is via |2,1,0> and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is 1/3, so the total is (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) ) = 1/3.

But earlier I thought that maybe the first transition's probabilities aren't the same for each m, which would change the total probability.

Wait, another approach: for each step, the dipole transition can change m by 0, ±1. So in the first step, the initial m=0 can go to m=-1, 0, +1.

The number of possible paths is 3, each with equal probability. So the first transition has probability 1/3 each.

In the second step, each intermediate state can transition to the final state in a certain way. But for each m in the intermediate state, the transition's probability might vary.

Wait, perhaps the dipole transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> has a probability that depends on m. For m=0, the transition is allowed with higher probability.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each possible path. If each path has a probability of (1/3)* (something), then the total is the sum.

Wait, perhaps the only allowed intermediate state is |2,1,0>, making the path have a probability of (1/3) * (something else). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, and the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option A is this path with probability 1/3.

So I think the answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has n=3, l=0, m=0, and the final state |1,0,0⟩ has n=1, l=0, m=0. The decay proceeds in two steps, and the intermediate state must have l=1, as l changes by ±1 in each transition.

### Step 1: First Transition
The first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. The transition probabilities for m=-1, 0, +1 are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of spherical harmonics. For simplicity, it is assumed that the probabilities for each m are equal, giving a probability of 1/3 for each possible intermediate state.

### Step 2: Second Transition
The second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. The final state has m=0, so the change in m (Δm) must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. This means:
- For m=1, Δm = -1 (allowed).
- For m=0, Δm = 0 (allowed).
- For m=-1, Δm = +1 (allowed).

Each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩, and the probabilities for these transitions are also assumed to be equal. Thus, the probability for each second transition is 1/3.

### Total Probability
The total probability for the decay is the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths:
- Path 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
- Path 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
- Path 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

Each path has a probability of (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three paths, the total probability is:
\[
\text{Total Probability} = 3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the calculated total probability.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 1/4.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

### Conclusion
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels through emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions have certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions (which I think is what this question refers to), the selection rules are Δn = 0, ±1 (but not zero, because that would mean no transition), and Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1, including zero. So l has to change by 1 each time because it's a dipole transition, which is a change in the orbital angular momentum.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, wait. The transition is happening in two steps, right? So it's going from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1, but each time the l has to change by ±1.

Wait, the initial state has l=0. So in the first transition, it needs to go to l=1. Because l can only change by ±1. So from l=0, the next possible is l=1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the first intermediate state must have l=1.

Possible options would be states with n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the first transition from |3,0,0> would go to |2,1,m>, where m is 0, ±1.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option A says it goes to |2,1,0> first, then to |1,0,0>. That makes sense because l goes from 0 to 1, then from 1 to 0. So that's allowed. But wait, what about the second transition? From l=1, can it go to l=0? Yes, because Δl= -1, which is allowed.

Now, let me think about the possible m values. The initial state is m=0. So in the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m in intermediate state is 0, -1, +1. So the first step could be m=0, m=1, or m=-1.

Looking at the options, option A's first transition is m=0. So |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>, then |2,1,0>→|1,0,0>. Option D also starts with |2,1,0>, but I'm not sure what the transition probability is.

Wait, the question is about the probability of the transition. I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element, which involves the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the dipole selection rules. For each transition, the allowed m changes are by 0, ±1.

In the first transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, m can be 0, 1, or -1. So that gives three possible states. The probability for each is then based on the possible m transitions.

Wait, the probability might relate to the number of possible m changes. For the first transition, the initial m is 0. So possible m in the next state are -1, 0, +1. So three possibilities. So the probability for each would be 1/3 each? Or maybe the transition probability is more involved.

Wait, but when a transition occurs, the change in m is determined by the photon's angular momentum, which can be -1, 0, or +1. So each possible m change has a certain probability. So for each transition, the sum of probabilities must be 1.

In the first step from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So each m transition has a probability, but I think the probability depends on the square of the matrix element.

Wait, but for each transition, the allowed m changes are 0, ±1. So the total number of possible m changes is 3. But perhaps each m change has an equal probability, so each would have a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but when you go from m=0 to m=0 in the first transition, that's allowed because Δm =0. So the initial state is m=0, and the first transition could just stay at m=0. So the first transition could go to |2,1,0>.

In the second transition, from |2,1,0>, the next state must have l=0, so m has to go from 0 to 0. Because the final state is m=0. So in the second transition, the m can change by -1, 0, +1, but since the final m is 0, from initial m=0, so Δm can be -1, 0, +1. But the final m is 0, so possible Δm is 0, but wait, no. Wait, in the second transition, you're going from l=1 to l=0. So the state must go from |2,1, m1> to |1,0, 0>.

Wait, the second transition is from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>. So in this case, m must be 0, because m can't change more than ±1. Because the final m is 0, so initial m can be -1, 0, +1. Wait no, from l=1, m can be -1, 0, 1. So for the second transition, you need to go from m to 0. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, what are the allowed transitions?

Wait, no, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1, m>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So in the second transition, the m must go from m to 0. So Δm can be -m? Wait, no. The change in m is the photon's m, which is -1, 0, or 1. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, the allowed m in the final state is m + Δm.

Wait, but the final state has m=0. So the initial state's m plus Δm must equal 0. So for each possible m in the intermediate state, the allowed Δm is (0 - m).

So in the second transition, the change in m is 0 - m. So possible m's in the intermediate state are those where 0 - m is allowed, which is if |0 - m| ≤ 1. So m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but in the second transition, from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>, m must change by -1, 0, or +1.

So if the intermediate state has m=+1, then the second transition would require Δm = -1 (since 0 = m + Δm → Δm = -1). For m=0, Δm=0. For m=-1, Δm=+1.

So all three possibilities are allowed.

But for the transition probabilities, each possible m in the intermediate state (after the first transition) can lead to the final state. So the overall probability is the sum over all possible intermediate m states of the product of the probabilities of each transition.

Wait, but each transition has a certain probability. Let me think about the probabilities for each step.

The first transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. The probability for each m is |<2,1,m | 3,0,0>|^2.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0>, which has l=0, m=0. The matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the spherical harmonic Y_{1, m} (since the dipole operator has l=1). So the matrix element <2,1,m | r |3,0,0> is proportional to <2,1,m | r |3,0,0>.

Wait, I think that r is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0} (since the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,0} or maybe a combination of Y_{1,m} with m=-1,0,+1? Wait, no, the dipole operator is a vector, so it has components in x, y, z. So the dipole transitions involve transitions where m changes by -1, 0, +1. So the matrix elements are non-zero only when m' = m + 0 (since the dipole operator in z-direction has m=0), or x and y components can change m by ±1.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me recall that for electric dipole transitions, the transition is allowed if Δl = ±1, Δn = ±1 (but n can't stay the same), and Δm = 0, ±1.

So for the first transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. So possible m transitions are m=0 → m= -1, 0, +1.

So the probability for each m would be the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or the integral involving the spherical harmonics. But perhaps in the simplest case, each m has an equal probability? Or maybe the probabilities are not the same.

Wait, no, I think the probability depends on the square of the integral. For a transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the probability is proportional to | ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_0^0 Y_{3,0} dΩ |². Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to remember that the dipole transitions have matrix elements that are non-zero only when the sum of the angular momenta allows it. So for |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>, the selection rule is m = 0 ± 1, but wait, wait, no. The dipole operator has l=1, so the transition is from l=0 to l=1, so m can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, perhaps the transition probability is proportional to (2l+1)δ_{L=1, l'}, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think that for each possible m, the probability is the same because of symmetry. So from m=0, you can go to m= -1, 0, +1, each with equal probability. So each has a probability of 1/3.

If that's the case, then the first transition has three possible paths: m = -1, 0, +1, each with probability 1/3.

Then, for each of those, the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So for each intermediate m, the second transition's m must change by 0, ±1 to reach m=0.

Wait, but the final state is m=0, so each intermediate m can transition to m=0 if the change is allowed.

So let's consider each possible intermediate state:

1. Intermediate state |2,1,0>:

For the second transition, from m=0 to m=0. So Δm=0. So the transition is allowed. The probability for this path is (1/3) * probability of this second transition.

Wait, but what's the probability of the second transition? Let me think. The second transition is from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>.

The probability for each such transition depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients as well. For each intermediate state, the transition to the final state occurs with a certain probability.

Wait, but for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m>, and the final is |1,0,0>. So again, the dipole selection rules apply: Δl must be -1 (since going from l=1 to l=0). And Δm must be 0, ±1. So for each intermediate m, the final m is 0, so Δm is (0 - m).

So Δm can be 0, -1, +1 only if |Δm| ≤1. So for each intermediate m, the transition is allowed only if (0 - m) is in {−1, 0, +1}.

Which would mean for m = -1, 0, +1. So all intermediate states are allowed.

But the probability for each transition would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but perhaps the transition probabilities are the same for each possible m? Or maybe it's more involved.

Wait, another approach: the total transition probability from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two steps (each step being a dipole transition) is the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each step.

So, the intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,-1>.

For each intermediate state, the probability of the first transition is P1(m), and the probability of the second transition is P2(m).

So the total probability is sum over m of P1(m) * P2(m).

But what are P1(m) and P2(m)?

Earlier, I thought P1(m) is 1/3 for each m, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for each m are not the same.

Wait, I think the transition probability for each m is proportional to |<2,1,m | r |3,0,0>|². So the matrix element is:

<2,1,m | r |3,0,0> = (something) <2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0>.

Wait, r is proportional to sqrt(4π/3) Y_{1,0}, so the dipole operator in the z-direction is proportional to Y_{1,0}, so the matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1,0} |3,0,0> ?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The dipole transition is governed by the operator r Y_{1,m}, perhaps. So for each component of the dipole, you have Y_{1,-1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}.

So for each dipole component, the matrix element is non-zero only when the initial state's m plus the dipole's m equals the final state's m. So for the z-component (Y_{1,0}), the matrix element is non-zero when m' = m_initial + 0, so m'=m_initial. So the initial state |3,0,0> has m=0, so the transition via Y_{1,0} would give m'=0 in the final state. For the x and y components, which involve Y_{1, ±1}, the transitions would allow m' = m_initial ±1.

Wait, so the dipole operator has three components, each corresponding to m = -1, 0, +1. So the transition from |3,0,0> can go to |2,1, m> where m = -1, 0, +1, each via a different component of the dipole operator.

Since each component contributes equally, perhaps each m has an equal probability. So for the first transition, each m has a probability of 1/3.

If that's the case, then the first transition's probabilities are 1/3 for each m=−1, 0, +1.

Now, for each m in the intermediate state, the second transition's probability is calculated similarly.

In the second transition, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the dipole operator again allows m to change by -1, 0, +1. So for each intermediate m, what's the allowed Δm to reach the final m=0.

So let's consider each case:

1. Intermediate state |2,1,1>:

To reach |1,0,0>, m must go from 1 → 0. So Δm = -1. So this transition is allowed, and the dipole component that causes this is Y_{1,−1}.

2. Intermediate state |2,1,0>:

Δm = 0. So dipole component Y_{1,0}.

3. Intermediate state |2,1,−1>:

Δm = +1. So dipole component Y_{1,1}.

The probability for the second transition depends on the matrix element for each case. But since each dipole component's matrix element would be similar, perhaps each transition has the same probability. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are the same for each m.

Wait, but the matrix elements might vary. Let me think: the matrix element for Y_{1, m} is proportional to <1,0,0 | Y_{1,m} |2,1, m'>.

Wait, no, for the second transition, from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>, the matrix element is <1,0,0 | r Y_{1, something} |2,1, m>.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each second transition has a probability of 1/3 as well. But no, because the second transition's m is fixed to 0, so the number of possible m's is 3 again? Or maybe the number of possible m's is 1, because the transition must lead to m=0.

Wait, no, in the second transition, the initial state's m can be -1, 0, +1. The final state's m is 0. So the change in m is (0 - initial m). So for each initial m, the change must be allowed (i.e., |Δm| ≤1). So for each initial m:

- If m=1: Δm = -1 → allowed.

- If m=0: Δm=0 → allowed.

- If m=-1: Δm=+1 → allowed.

So each transition is allowed, and each has a certain probability.

But what's the probability for each?

Assuming each dipole component contributes equally, the probability for the second transition from each intermediate state would be 1/3 each. But wait, no, because for each intermediate m, the allowed Δm is fixed.

Wait, perhaps each second transition (from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>) has a probability of 1/3, but that doesn't make sense because the sum over all possibilities must be 1.

Alternatively, maybe each second transition has a probability of 1/3 regardless of m. Wait, but there are three possible intermediate m's, and each transition from those has a certain probability.

Wait, maybe the probability for each second transition is 1/3 multiplied by the initial probability. But no, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition has a certain probability for each m, and the total for each first transition is the product.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has a probability of 1/3 for each m, and the second transition for each m has a probability of 1/3 as well. Then the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three paths, the total is 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

Wait, but that would make the total probability 1/3, which is an option in the given choices (option A is 1/3).

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Another approach: in the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0>. It can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1, 0>, |2,1, 1>, each with equal probability. Then, from each of these, the probability of transitioning to |1,0,0> is the same because the dipole allows m to change by -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but going from |2,1,1> to |1,0,0> requires Δm = -1, which corresponds to a certain Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and similarly for the others.

Wait, but perhaps each second transition has a probability of 1/3 as well. So each path (like |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0>) would have a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9. But since there are three such paths, the total would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3.

But wait, the options don't all have 1/3. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says the probability is 1/3. That's one possibility.

Option D says the probability is 2/3. Hmm, how would that happen?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that each first transition has equal probability. Perhaps the first transition doesn't have equal probabilities for m=−1, 0, +1. Because the matrix element could be different for each. For example, maybe m=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, what's the matrix element for the first transition for each m?

The transition is from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. The matrix element is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1, m'} | 3,0,0>.

Wait, but the dipole operator in the z-direction is proportional to Y_{1,0}, so the matrix element for m'=0 would be non-zero. For m=0, the transition is allowed via Y_{1,0}. For m=+1 and -1, the transitions are allowed via Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1}.

But the integral of Y_{1, m} * Y_{0,0} * Y_{3,0} would determine the matrix element's magnitude.

I think that the matrix element for m=0 is larger because Y_{1,0} is real (up to a phase) and might lead to a larger overlap. Whereas for m=+1 and −1, the spherical harmonics have more nodes and perhaps smaller overlaps.

Wait, actually, the integral of Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} Y_{3,0} is zero unless certain angular momentum conditions are met. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The product Y_{1,m} Y_{3,0} can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l, m'}, so the matrix element would be non-zero only when the total angular momentum adds up correctly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l1=1 (from Y_{1,m}) and l2=0 (from Y_{0,0}) to get L=3? Wait, that can't be. Because 1 and 0 can add up to 1, not 3. So perhaps the matrix element is zero for all m except when the combined angular momentum can reach 3.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I recall that the transition probability from |n, l, m> to |n', l', m'> is non-zero only if l' = l ±1, and |m' - m| ≤1.

But in the first transition, from l=0 to l=1, so that's allowed. For the second transition, l=1 to l=0, which is allowed.

But regarding the probabilities, perhaps only the m=0 transitions contribute, but that can't be right because the options include other possibilities.

Wait, let me think about the possible paths.

Option A says the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, with probability 1/3.

Option D says the same path but with probability 2/3.

Hmm, why would the probability be 2/3?

Wait, perhaps the other options involve paths that are forbidden, making the only allowed path the one in options A and D, but with different probabilities.

Wait, for example, if the first transition can't go to |2,1,1> or |2,1,-1>, then the only possibility is m=0, making the probability for the first transition 1, and then the second transition would have a probability of 1 as well.

But wait, that's not possible because the matrix elements for m=±1 might be zero.

Wait, but when you have a transition from l=0 to l=1, m can only change by 0, ±1. So all three m transitions are allowed, but perhaps only one has a non-zero matrix element.

Which one?

Wait, perhaps the initial state is |3,0,0>, and the dipole operator has components Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}. So the transition can occur via any of these components.

But the matrix element for m=0 would involve the Y_{1,0} term, whereas m=+1 would involve Y_{1,1}, and m=-1 would involve Y_{1,-1}.

The integral for the matrix element <2,1,m | Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0> is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are met.

Wait, the integral of Y_{2,1,m} Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0}^* dΩ.

According to angular momentum addition rules, the product Y_{l=1, m'} Y_{l=3, m=0} must result in a state with L=2 or 4? Wait, no, because when you multiply two spherical harmonics, Y_{l1,m1} Y_{l2,m2}, the result can be expressed as a sum of Y_{l, m} where l ranges from |l1-l2| to l1+l2.

So in our case, Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} would give terms with l from 2 to 4.

The state |2,1,m> has l=2, so the integral would be non-zero only if the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} has an l=2 component.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling l=1 and l=3 to get l=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan series: 1 and 3 can couple to L=4, 2, and 0.

So the possible L values are 4, 2, 0.

Thus, the product Y_{1,m'} Y_{3,0} will have components for L=4, 2, 0.

Therefore, the integral <2,1,m | Y_{1,m'} |3,0,0> is non-zero only when L=2, which corresponds to the coupling of l1=1 and l2=3.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when the product includes the L=2 component. So the matrix element is non-zero only when L=2.

Thus, the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> via Y_{1,m'} is allowed only for certain m' and m.

Wait, but m' is the m of the dipole component. So for each m', the matrix element will have a certain dependence on m.

So for m' = 0: Y_{1,0}. The product Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0} would have components for L=4, 2, 0.

So the |2,1,m> state can be reached via this component if L=2 and m=0.

The matrix element would be non-zero for m=0.

Similarly, for m' = +1: Y_{1,1}. The product Y_{1,1} Y_{3,0} will have terms for L=4, 2, 0.

So when L=2, the m would be 1 (since m1 + m2 = m' + 0 = m'). So for L=2, m can be up to 2, so m=1 is allowed.

Similarly, for m' = -1: Y_{1,-1}. The product Y_{1,-1} Y_{3,0} would lead to L=4, 2, 0. For L=2, m would be -1.

So the matrix element for each m' is non-zero only for specific m in |2,1,m>.

But wait, in the first transition, we're considering the transition from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m> via the dipole operator, which includes Y_{1, m'}.

So the matrix element is non-zero only when the combination of m' and m leads to the correct L and m.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps the only allowed transitions from |3,0,0> are to |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, and |2,1,-1>.

But I need to find the probability for each.

Perhaps the only allowed transition is for m'=0, giving m=0 in the intermediate state. Because when you have Y_{1,0} leading to m'=0, the matrix element would be non-zero for m=0. But for m'=1 and m'=-1, perhaps the matrix elements are zero.

Wait, no, because earlier I concluded that all three are allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the selection rules for dipole transitions allow m to change by 0, ±1.

So for the first transition, any m in |2,1,m> is allowed.

But the transition amplitude for each m would involve the integral of Y_{2,1,m} Y_{1, m'} Y_{3,0}^*.

But perhaps the only non-zero integral is when m' = 0 and m=0.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because Y_{2,1,0} is orthogonal to Y_{1,0} Y_{3,0}, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the integral is non-zero only when m'=0, leading to m=0.

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the first transition to m=0 is 3 times higher than for m=±1. Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 might be sqrt(3), while for m=±1 it's 1.

Wait, I remember that for certain transitions, the probabilities for m=0 are higher due to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me try to think of specific examples.

In hydrogen, the transition from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0 has certain probabilities for different m changes. I think that the transition from m=0 to m=0 has a higher probability than others.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for m=0 are higher than for m=±1 because of the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has a higher probability for m=0. Let's say the probability for m=0 is 3/4 and for m=±1 is 1/4 each. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition's probabilities are proportional to (2 - m)(2 + m), but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the possible paths and their probabilities. Suppose the only allowed intermediate states are |2,1,0>, and the others are forbidden. Then the probability would be the product of the probabilities for each step.

But the options include other possibilities.

Wait, another idea: the selection rules for the dipole transitions also require that the parity changes. The parity of the state is (-1)^l. So for a transition from l=0 (even) to l=1 (odd), the parity changes, which is allowed for a dipole transition (since dipole operator has parity -1, so even → odd is allowed).

But this doesn't directly affect the m transitions.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which says the transition is via |2,1,0> and the probability is 1/3.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps each transition's probability is 1/3, so the total is (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(1/3) ) = 1/3.

But earlier I thought that maybe the first transition's probabilities aren't the same for each m, which would change the total probability.

Wait, another approach: for each step, the dipole transition can change m by 0, ±1. So in the first step, the initial m=0 can go to m=-1, 0, +1.

The number of possible paths is 3, each with equal probability. So the first transition has probability 1/3 each.

In the second step, each intermediate state can transition to the final state in a certain way. But for each m in the intermediate state, the transition's probability might vary.

Wait, perhaps the dipole transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0> has a probability that depends on m. For m=0, the transition is allowed with higher probability.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each possible path. If each path has a probability of (1/3)* (something), then the total is the sum.

Wait, perhaps the only allowed intermediate state is |2,1,0>, making the path have a probability of (1/3) * (something else). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, and the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option A is this path with probability 1/3.

So I think the answer is option A.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ has n=3, l=0, m=0, and the final state |1,0,0⟩ has n=1, l=0, m=0. The decay proceeds in two steps, and the intermediate state must have l=1, as l changes by ±1 in each transition.

### Step 1: First Transition
The first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1. The transition probabilities for m=-1, 0, +1 are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the overlap of spherical harmonics. For simplicity, it is assumed that the probabilities for each m are equal, giving a probability of 1/3 for each possible intermediate state.

### Step 2: Second Transition
The second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. The final state has m=0, so the change in m (Δm) must satisfy |Δm| ≤ 1. This means:
- For m=1, Δm = -1 (allowed).
- For m=0, Δm = 0 (allowed).
- For m=-1, Δm = +1 (allowed).

Each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩, and the probabilities for these transitions are also assumed to be equal. Thus, the probability for each second transition is 1/3.

### Total Probability
The total probability for the decay is the sum of the probabilities for all possible paths:
- Path 1: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
- Path 2: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
- Path 3: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,+1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩

Each path has a probability of (1/3) × (1/3) = 1/9. Since there are three paths, the total probability is:
\[
\text{Total Probability} = 3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. This matches the calculated total probability.
- **Option B**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 1/4.
- **Option C**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D**: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 2/3. This is incorrect because the total probability is 1/3, not 2/3.

### Conclusion
The correct transition route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a total probability of 1/3.
