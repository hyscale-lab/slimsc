Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem gives the metric as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this is a two-dimensional metric because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So the space is two-dimensional, like maybe a surface.

The question is asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the metric given.

First, let me understand the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator becomes small, making ds² large. So there's a singularity perhaps at x² + y² =4. Interesting.

Wait, but what kind of coordinates are these? Maybe it's a coordinate system where the space is being described. I'm trying to recall: in 2D, the metric can be written in terms of line elements, and for a surface, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

So the metric tensor here is diagonal with components [32/(4 - x² - y²), 32/(4 - x² - y²)]. So the determinant g would be (32/(4 - r²))², where r² is x² + y². Because in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y². So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dr dθ, but wait, no, in Cartesian coordinates, it's sqrt(g) dx dy. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to switch to polar coordinates.

Wait, alternatively, in 2D, the area is the integral over the coordinates of sqrt(g) dx dy. So let me compute g. The metric tensor is diagonal, with g_xx = 32/(4 - r²) and similarly for g_yy. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - r²))². So the square root of g would be 32/(4 - r²).

So the area would be the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Wait, but integrating over what region? Because the denominator is 4 - r², so r² must be less than 4 for the metric to be real and non-singular. So the coordinates are valid where x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2, since 2² is 4.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Because in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So let me set up the integral.

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let me make a substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. Hmm, but I have r dr in the numerator. So let's see:

I = ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²)
= 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r² )

Let me let u = 4 - r², so du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So substituting:

I = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u
= 32 (-1/2) ∫ du/u
= -16 ∫ du/u
= -16 ln|u| + C
= -16 ln(4 - r²) + C

But when we evaluate from r=0 to r=2. Let's plug in the limits.

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. At r=0, u=4 → ln(4).

Wait, so evaluating from 0 to 2:

I = [ -16 ln(0) ) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so -16 ln(0) is positive infinity. So the integral I is divergent—it goes to infinity.

So the inner integral is infinite, which means the entire area integral is infinite. So the area is infinite. But wait, that doesn't make sense for a sphere. Or does it?

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a surface with constant negative curvature. Maybe like the tractricoid or something. But the metric given here seems to be a two-dimensional metric, so perhaps this is a model of the hyperbolic plane or something similar, which is known to have infinite area.

Wait, but the pseudosphere of radius r=2... Oh wait, maybe the question is about the area of a pseudosphere in some specific model.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a conformally flat metric. So in 2D, the line element is conformally flat if it's written as E²(x,y) (dx² + dy²). Here, E(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)}.

Wait, but the area of a surface in such a metric would be the integral over the surface of sqrt(g) dx dy, which, as I said earlier, is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So when integrating over the entire allowed region (where r <2), the integral becomes infinite. Because as r approaches 2 from below, the integrand 32/(4 - r²) blows up. So the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but why is the question asking about a pseudosphere? Because the pseudosphere has finite area, doesn't it? Or is it that in some models, like the hyperbolic plane, the area is infinite.

Wait, pseudosphere is a surface in 3D with finite area, right? Like the tractricoid, which has finite area. But perhaps in this metric, which is two-dimensional, the area is infinite.

Wait, maybe the pseudosphere in this context is being embedded in two dimensions. Or perhaps the metric given represents a pseudosphere in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.

The determinant g is (32/(4 - r²))², so sqrt(g) is 32/(4 - r²).

The area integral in polar coordinates is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The inner integral is ∫0^2 [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫0^2 [ r dr ]/(4 - r²)

Let me compute this again. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2)du = r dr.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the limits change from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) du/u = 32*(-1/2)[ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so:

32*(-1/2) [ (-infinite) - ln(4) ] = 32*(1/2)( (infinite) + ln(4) )

Wait, because [ -infinite - finite ] is -infinite, but multiplied by (-1/2), it becomes (1/2)*infinite.

So 32*(1/2)*infinite → 16 * infinite → infinite.

So the inner integral is indeed divergent. Hence, the entire area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Understanding the Metric
The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). In 2D, the area element is given by \( \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
g = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 2: Switching to Polar Coordinates
To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluating the Inner Integral
The inner integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) and \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
32 \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right).
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \).

### Step 4: Conclusion
The divergence of the inner integral implies that the total area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the given metric describes a surface with infinite area, such as a model of the hyperbolic plane. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere in this context is \( +\infty \).

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Because in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y². So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dr dθ, but wait, no, in Cartesian coordinates, it's sqrt(g) dx dy. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to switch to polar coordinates.

Wait, alternatively, in 2D, the area is the integral over the coordinates of sqrt(g) dx dy. So let me compute g. The metric tensor is diagonal, with g_xx = 32/(4 - r²) and similarly for g_yy. So the determinant g is (32/(4 - r²))². So the square root of g would be 32/(4 - r²).

So the area would be the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. Wait, but integrating over what region? Because the denominator is 4 - r², so r² must be less than 4 for the metric to be real and non-singular. So the coordinates are valid where x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2, since 2² is 4.

So the area would be the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. Because in polar coordinates, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So let me set up the integral.

Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let me make a substitution u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. Hmm, but I have r dr in the numerator. So let's see:

I = ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²)
= 32 ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r² )

Let me let u = 4 - r², so du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So substituting:

I = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u
= 32 (-1/2) ∫ du/u
= -16 ∫ du/u
= -16 ln|u| + C
= -16 ln(4 - r²) + C

But when we evaluate from r=0 to r=2. Let's plug in the limits.

At r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0 → ln(0) is negative infinity. At r=0, u=4 → ln(4).

Wait, so evaluating from 0 to 2:

I = [ -16 ln(0) ) ] - [ -16 ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so -16 ln(0) is positive infinity. So the integral I is divergent—it goes to infinity.

So the inner integral is infinite, which means the entire area integral is infinite. So the area is infinite. But wait, that doesn't make sense for a sphere. Or does it?

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a surface with constant negative curvature. Maybe like the tractricoid or something. But the metric given here seems to be a two-dimensional metric, so perhaps this is a model of the hyperbolic plane or something similar, which is known to have infinite area.

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a conformally flat metric. So in 2D, the line element is conformally flat if it's written as E²(x,y) (dx² + dy²). Here, E(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)}.

Wait, but the area of a surface in such a metric would be the integral over the surface of sqrt(g) dx dy, which, as I said earlier, is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So when integrating over the entire allowed region (where r <2), the integral becomes infinite. Because as r approaches 2 from below, the integrand 32/(4 - r²) blows up. So the area would be infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer should be D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.

The determinant g is (32/(4 - r²))², so sqrt(g) is 32/(4 - r²).

The area integral in polar coordinates is ∫0^{2π} ∫0^2 [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The inner integral is ∫0^2 [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²) = 32 ∫0^2 [ r dr ]/(4 - r²)

Let me compute this again. Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2)du = r dr.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the limits change from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) du/u = 32*(-1/2)[ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is 32*(-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so:

32*(-1/2) [ (-infinite) - ln(4) ] = 32*(1/2)( (infinite) + ln(4) )

Wait, because [ -infinite - finite ] is -infinite, but multiplied by (-1/2), it becomes (1/2)*infinite.

So 32*(1/2)*infinite → 16 * infinite → infinite.

So the inner integral is indeed divergent. Hence, the entire area is infinite. So the correct answer is D) +infty.


The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Understanding the Metric
The metric is conformally flat, with the conformal factor \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). In 2D, the area element is given by \( \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
g = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 2: Switching to Polar Coordinates
To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluating the Inner Integral
The inner integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) and \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
32 \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0 = -16 \left( \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right).
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \).

### Step 4: Conclusion
The divergence of the inner integral implies that the total area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the given metric describes a surface with infinite area, such as a model of the hyperbolic plane. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere in this context is \( +\infty \).

### Final Answer:
The area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
