Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states or squeezed states, which have well-behaved density matrices in terms of their Wigner functions. Non-Gaussian states, like the Schrödinger cat state, don't have such nice properties. The non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-classical the state is, right?

The problem gives me a specific state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's. So, this is basically the difference in the von Neumann entropy between the two states.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think I need to find rho and tau first.

The state |psi> is already given, so the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. But tau is the reference Gaussian state. Hmm, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because when dealing with non-Gaussianity, the reference is often the closest Gaussian state to rho, like the one that minimizes the relative entropy. But in this problem, I think tau is given as the Gaussian state that we're comparing against. Alternatively, maybe it's the state that's the Gaussian approximation of the given state?

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to rho, and for which the relative entropy is calculated. But I'm not exactly sure how to find tau. Or maybe, in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the one that's a Gaussian version of |psi>, perhaps a coherent state or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when you have a state like |psi>, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of those two states with the same coefficients, but without the quantum interference. So, for a state |a> = c|alpha> + d|beta>, the reference Gaussian might be the classical mixture, like (c² |alpha><alpha| + d² |beta><beta|). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first moments (like the same mean photon number and quadrature variances) as rho. But I'm not too sure about that.

But wait, maybe the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to the maximum entropy Gaussian state. Or perhaps, since the state is a superposition, the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first moments as the given state. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed step by step.

Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

First, compute N. Let's calculate N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

So, phi is -pi/4. So 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1.

Exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So sin(2phi) is -1, so sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Phi is -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but wait: |alpha> is a coherent state with amplitude alpha, and |-alpha> is the coherent state with amplitude -alpha. So when phi is -pi/4, we have equal coefficients, but with opposite signs. Interesting.

So, the state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, each multiplied by sqrt(2)/2, but normalized by N ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

So rho = ( [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] [ cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ] ) / N².

Expanding that, it's ( cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N².

So rho is a 2x2 mixture of these terms. The off-diagonal terms are |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa, which are non-Gaussian because they represent interference between two coherent states. So the state rho is a pure state, but the off-diagonal terms are significant.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. I'm a bit stuck on what tau would be. I think tau is the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho. But how do I find that?

Wait, perhaps in the context of calculating relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments (like the mean photon number and the covariance matrix) as rho. Alternatively, if rho is a pure state, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the relative entropy between rho and tau is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But wait, no, wait: del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the difference in the entropies.

Wait, but von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). So del_b would be [ -Tr(rho ln rho) ] - [ -Tr(tau ln tau) ] = [Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho) ].

Wait, no. Let me compute del_b again. The problem states:

del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

So it's the sum of the two terms, but wait, normally the von Neumann entropy is -Tr(rho ln rho), so positive if rho is mixed. So if rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero because rho is a projector, so rho ln rho is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if rho is pure, rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 0. So ln rho is ln(1) for the eigenvalue 1, which is 0, and ln(0) is undefined, but when you take Tr(rho ln rho), the eigenvalue 0 multiplied by 0 (since rho has 0s on the 0 eigenvalues) would contribute nothing. So Tr(rho ln rho) is zero when rho is pure. So del_b would be 0 - Tr(tau ln tau). But that's if rho is pure.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's think about rho being a pure state. For a pure state, rho is a projector, so it's rank 1. So Tr(rho ln rho) would be ln(1) * 1 + ln(0)*0, but the trace is only over the non-zero eigenvalues. So Tr(rho ln rho) is 0 because ln(1)=0. So del_b becomes 0 - Tr(tau ln tau). But that would mean del_b is negative because Tr(tau ln tau) is positive (since it's the entropy of a mixed state). No, wait, tau is a Gaussian state, but it can be pure or mixed.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The problem says that tau is a reference Gaussian state. The non-Gaussian state is rho, which is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state. So for rho, von Neumann entropy is zero. Then del_b = [0] - [Tr(tau ln tau)].

But that would mean that del_b is negative. But non-Gaussianity is a non-negative quantity, so perhaps I have misunderstood the definition.

Wait, perhaps the formula is del_b = Tr(tau ln(tau)) - Tr(rho ln rho). Because then, if rho is pure, its entropy is zero, so del_b equals the entropy of tau. But that's not making sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the relative entropy formula. The relative entropy between two states rho and sigma is defined as S(rho || sigma) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln sigma)) ). So it's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln sigma). But in this problem, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the reverse of the standard relative entropy. Hmm.

Wait, if del_b is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau), then if rho is a pure state and tau is a mixed state, rho's entropy is zero, and tau's entropy is positive. So del_b would be negative. But that can't be the case for non-Gaussianity, which should be a positive quantity. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition of del_b. Let me re-read the question. The question says, "del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state."

So according to the problem, del_b is the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. But if rho is pure, its entropy is zero. So del_b would be negative if tau is mixed. But non-Gaussian states are supposed to have higher non-Gaussianity, so I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state, but taken as a positive quantity. So perhaps del_b is |Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)|. But the problem statement doesn't say that. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being defined differently, such as S(tau || rho), which would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho). But in that case, if rho is pure and tau is a Gaussian approximation, maybe it's positive.

But the problem says it's rho and tau, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the negative of the standard relative entropy. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's think differently. Perhaps I can compute the non-Gaussianity without computing all the terms, maybe for specific values of phi and alpha. The given phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5.

First, let's compute N.

As I did before: sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N² = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

The state is |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So, |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with equal amplitudes (but opposite signs) divided by a normalization constant.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So, the entropy Tr(rho ln rho) is zero, as rho is a projector.

So del_b, according to the formula given, would be 0 - Tr(tau ln tau).

But that would mean del_b is negative, which doesn't make sense for non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy from the non-Gaussian state to the Gaussian state, which would be the standard relative entropy S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in the problem, it's given as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually defining non-Gaussianity as the difference in entropies in a way that's non-negative. So perhaps when rho is non-Gaussian, its entropy minus that of a Gaussian state would be positive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute del_b as the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, which is defined as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state.

Hmm. Another thought: the non-Gaussianity can also be computed as the minimum of the relative entropy between rho and all possible Gaussian states tau. So, del_b would be the minimal value of S(rho || tau) over all Gaussian tau.

But in this problem, we're given a specific rho and a specific tau. So maybe tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho, and we need to compute the relative entropy between them.

In that case, perhaps rho is a pure state, and tau is the optimal Gaussian approximation. But I'm not sure how to compute tau.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same mean, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. For a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity is due to the interference terms in the density matrix. The relative entropy will measure how much the state deviates from Gaussian.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps in this specific case, when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is something that can be compared to a specific Gaussian state.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, it's a symmetric case. Let me think about the structure of rho. rho has terms |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, and the cross terms |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|.

In the density matrix, the cross terms are non-Gaussian because Gaussian states (like coherent states) don't have such terms when expressed in a basis of coherent states. So the non-Gaussian part is in the off-diagonal terms.

But to compute the relative entropy, I need to compute the entropies of rho and tau. Since rho is a pure state, as I said earlier, its entropy is zero. So if tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state (or a mixture), but then its entropy might be non-zero.

Wait, but if tau is a pure Gaussian state, like a coherent state, then its entropy would be zero. So del_b would be 0 -0 =0, which would correspond to option D. But that can't be right because the state rho is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting it wrong because tau is not a pure state. Maybe tau is a mixed Gaussian state that best approximates rho.

Wait, another approach: The state |psi> is a superposition state, so it's a pure state. The reference Gaussian state would be the state with the same first moments (like the first moments of position and momentum) as rho, but without the quantum interference terms. So, perhaps the reference Gaussian tau is the state which is a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha> with the same probabilities as rho.

Wait, rho is a pure state, so the probabilities are cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi), but normalized by N². Wait, no, because N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)), which depends on phi and alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum likelihood Gaussian state that approximates rho. For a two-mode state, perhaps the reference Gaussian is the state where the off-diagonal terms are set to zero, leaving only the diagonal terms. So in that case, tau would be (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) / 2, assuming equal probabilities. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a Gaussian state that matches the moments of rho, such as the first and second moments. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let's think about what happens when the state is a coherent state. If the state is |alpha>, then it's a Gaussian state, so non-Gaussianity would be zero. But in our case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0, which would be the case if the state was Gaussian. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is zero only when the state is Gaussian. But in this case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian, leading to non-zero non-Gaussianity. So del_b should be non-zero.

But how to compute it numerically?

Wait, perhaps the state is such that the cross terms in rho are zero, making rho a mixture of two coherent states, which would make it a Gaussian state. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, let me compute the cross terms. The cross terms are [ cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(- alpha²) times e^{alpha (-alpha)*} + ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps the off-diagonal terms in rho involve terms like <alpha| -alpha> which are exp(-|alpha + alpha|^2 /2) because the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-|alpha + alpha|^2 / 2) = exp(- (2 alpha)^2 / 2 ) = exp(-2 alpha²).

Wait, no, the inner product <alpha | beta> is exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha beta^* ). So for beta = -alpha, <alpha| -alpha> = exp( - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha (-alpha)^* ) = exp( - alpha^2 + (- alpha^2) )? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, alpha is a real number in this context because the coherent state is usually parametrized by a real alpha in the position quadrature. Or perhaps it's complex, but in this case, the problem uses alpha and -alpha, which are real and negative.

So, <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + | -alpha |^2 ) / 2 + alpha (-alpha)^* ) = exp( - (2 alpha^2 ) /2 + alpha (-alpha) ) = exp( - alpha² - alpha² ) = exp(-2 alpha²).

So, the off-diagonal term in rho is [ cos(phi) sin(phi) ] (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) / N², multiplied by exp(-2 alpha²).

So rho has these non-diagonal terms, making it non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau, perhaps, is a mixture of |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha|, but without the cross terms. So, tau would be [ |alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ] / 2, assuming equal probabilities.

Wait, but the probabilities in rho are cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi), divided by N^2. So, perhaps the reference state tau is a mixture with the same weights as rho's diagonal terms.

Wait, considering that, let's compute the diagonal terms of rho. The diagonal elements are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|, divided by N². So the probabilities are (cos² phi / N²) and (sin² phi / N²).

So the reference Gaussian state tau would be a classical mixture of these two coherent states with the same probabilities as in rho. So, tau = [ cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / (cos²(phi) + sin²(phi)), but since cos² + sin² =1, it's just tau = cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|.

Wait, but N² is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). So, in our case, phi is -pi/4, so cos^2(phi) is 0.5, and sin^2(phi) is 0.5.

So tau becomes 0.5 |0.5><0.5| + 0.5 |-0.5><-0.5|.

Now, each of these is a coherent state, which is Gaussian, so the mixture tau is also a Gaussian state.

So, rho is a pure state, tau is a mixed Gaussian state.

So, to compute del_b, we have del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

But rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b becomes 0 - Tr(tau ln tau).

What is Tr(tau ln tau)?

Since tau is a mixed state of two pure states with equal probabilities (0.5 each), the entropy S(tau) is -0.5 ln 0.5 -0.5 ln 0.5 = ln 2 ≈ 0.6931.

So Tr(tau ln tau) = S(tau) = ln 2. So del_b = 0 - ln 2 ≈ -0.6931.

But non-Gaussianity is supposed to be a positive measure, so perhaps the definition is the absolute value. So |del_b| would be approximately 0.6931, which is about 0.69.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.25, option C is 1.38, which is about twice 0.69. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake. Because the definition of del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b would be negative, but non-Gaussianity is the absolute value, so perhaps the correct non-Gaussianity is the absolute value. So nG = |del_b|= ln 2 ≈0.693.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option B (0.25) or C (1.38). Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the reference Gaussian state. Maybe the reference state isn't a mixture of the coherent states. Maybe it's a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same mean photon number as rho.

Wait, the mean photon number for rho would be the same as the mean photon number of the reference Gaussian state. So perhaps we need to compute the photon number for rho.

The photon number for rho can be calculated as Tr(rho a† a), where a† is the creation operator and a is the annihilation operator.

But rho is |psi><psi|, so Tr(rho a† a) = <psi| a† a |psi>.

So let's compute that.

For a coherent state |beta>, a |beta> = beta |beta>.

So, for |alpha>, a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>,

Similarly, for |-alpha>, a |-alpha> = -alpha |-alpha>.

So, compute <psi | a† a | psi>.

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So, <psi | a† a | psi> = (1/N²) [ cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] a† a [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ].

Expanding this, it's (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a† a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a† a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha| a† a |-alpha> ].

Now, a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>.

Similarly, a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

So, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = alpha^2.

< -alpha | a† a | -alpha> = alpha^2.

What about <alpha | a† a |-alpha>?

a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

So <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Similarly for the other term.

Putting it all together:

<psi | a† a | psi> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) alpha^2 + cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin^2(phi) alpha^2 ].

Factor out alpha^2:

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ cos^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin^2(phi) ].

Wait, cos(phi) sin(phi) + sin(phi) cos(phi) = 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = sin(2 phi).

So,

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

But cos² + sin² =1, so this becomes:

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Wait, but N² is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2).

So, substituting, we get:

= (alpha^2 / N²) * N² = alpha^2.

So, the mean photon number for rho is alpha^2.

In our case, alpha=0.5, so alpha^2 =0.25. So the mean photon number is 0.25.

Now, the maximum entropy Gaussian state with this mean photon number is a coherent state with the same mean, right? Because the maximum entropy state for a given mean (and perhaps variance, but Gaussian states are determined by mean and covariance matrix) is the coherent state.

Wait, but the coherent state has mean photon number |alpha|^2, yes. So in this case, the maximum entropy Gaussian state with mean photon number 0.25 would be |0.5>, a coherent state.

Alternatively, the reference Gaussian state could be the maximum entropy state given the same first moments, which in this case would be a coherent state |0.5>.

So, if tau is |0.5><0.5|, a pure Gaussian state, then Tr(tau ln tau) is zero because it's a pure state.

So del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = 0 - 0 =0.

But that can't be right because rho is non-Gaussian, so its non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Another approach: perhaps the relative entropy measure is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state.

In that case, the non-Gaussianity would be the minimum relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's challenging to compute this.

Wait, maybe in this specific scenario, when phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is such that the relative entropy becomes zero. But why would that be?

Wait, earlier when we assumed tau was a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, then the non-Gaussianity was positive. But if tau is the coherent state |0.5>, then del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But why would the non-Gaussianity be zero in this case? Because the state rho is a superposition, which is non-Gaussian, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a superposition but phi is such that the cross terms vanish, but that's not the case here with phi=-pi/4.

Wait, perhaps there's a symmetry when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5 that makes the non-Gaussianity zero. But I can't think why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero. That would imply that the state is Gaussian, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state, making it Gaussian. Let's see.

|psi> = [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / N.

If we take N as sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-0.5)).

But that's a superposition of two different coherent states, so it's not a coherent state itself. So it's a non-Gaussian state.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of some observable, making it Gaussian, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for the non-Gaussianity ends up being zero because the entropy terms cancel out. But earlier I thought that when rho is pure and tau is pure, then del_b would be zero, but in that case, since both are pure, del_b would be zero, but rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy directly. Let me think about how to compute S(rho) and S(tau).

But rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. tau is a Gaussian state, which is a mixture of two coherent states. The entropy of tau is S(tau) = -p ln p - (1-p) ln (1-p), where p is the probability of each state in the mixture. In our case, p=0.5, so S(tau)= ln 2 ≈ 0.6931.

So del_b = 0 - 0.6931 = -0.6931. But non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so perhaps it's the absolute value, which would be 0.6931. But none of the options match exactly. The options are A)2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value of N when phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2)=-1.

alpha=0.5, so alpha²=0.25. 2 alpha²=0.5, so exp(-0.5)=1/sqrt(e)≈0.6065.

So N²=1 + (-1)(0.6065)=0.3935. So N≈0.6275.

Then, the probabilities are (cos²(phi) / N²) and (sin²(phi)/N²).

Phi is -pi/4, cos^2(phi)=0.5, sin^2(phi)=0.5.

So the probabilities in rho are 0.5/(0.3935)≈1.2705 and same for the other term. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no: rho is |psi><psi|, so the diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| / N² and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha| / N². So the probabilities are (cos^2 phi)/ N² and (sin² phi)/ N². But since N² <1, these probabilities sum to (cos² + sin²)/ N² =1/(N²) >1. That can't be correct because probabilities in a density matrix must sum to 1.

Wait, that suggests I'm making a mistake. The diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| / N² and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha| / N². But the matrix elements are not probabilities. The probabilities would be Tr(rho_P), where rho_P is the density matrix projected onto the position basis or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the diagonal terms in the density matrix in the coherent state basis are not the same as probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should think of rho as a 2x2 matrix in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}.

So, rho can be written as a 2x2 matrix:

rho = [ [ |cos(phi)|^2, cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha²) ],
         [ sin(phi) cos(phi) exp(-2 alpha²), |sin(phi)|^2 ] ] / N².

Because the off-diagonal terms are (cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha²)) in both positions because <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 alpha²), as I computed earlier.

So, when phi=-pi/4, cos(phi)=sin(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, and exp(-2 alpha²)=exp(-0.5)=approx 0.6065.

So, the matrix becomes:

rho = [ [ (0.5 / N² ), (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / N² ],
         [ (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / N², 0.5 / N² ] ].

N² is 0.3935, so 1/N²≈2.541.

So, rho ≈ [ [ 0.5 * 2.541, 0.5*0.6065 * 2.541 ],
            [ 0.5*0.6065 *2.541, 0.5 *2.541 ] ] ≈ [ [ 1.2705, 0.7693 ],
            [ 0.7693, 1.2705 ] ].

Wait, but wait. The diagonal elements are (0.5 / 0.3935) ≈1.2705, and the off-diagonal elements are (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / 0.3935 ≈ (0.30325) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.7693.

But wait, the trace should be 1. Let's check: 1.2705 + 1.2705 = 2.541, which is greater than 1. So that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait, I think the mistake is that in the matrix, the diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2 multiplied by 1/N², which is 1/(0.3935)≈2.541. But since cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi) are each 0.5, the diagonal terms are 0.5 * 2.541 ≈1.2705 each. But that would make the trace of rho equal to approximately 2.541, which is impossible because rho must be a valid density matrix with trace 1.

Ah, I see where I went wrong. The correct expression is rho = [ [ cos^2(phi), cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ],
                                                          [ sin(phi) cos(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2), sin^2(phi) ] ] / N².

Wait, no, wait. The actual matrix is:

rho_ij = [ |<alpha| psi>|^2, <alpha| psi> <psi| -alpha> ]
         [ < -alpha | psi> <psi | alpha>, |< -alpha | psi> |^2 ]

But |<alpha | psi> |^2 = [ cos^2(phi) + <alpha | - alpha> sin(phi) cos(phi) ] / N².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The correct way to construct rho is in the basis of |alpha> and |-alpha>.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N.

So, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which in the basis { |alpha>, |-alpha> } is a 2x2 matrix:

rho = [ [ |a|^2, a b* ],
         [ a* b, |b|^2 ] ]

where a = cos(phi) / N and b = sin(phi) / N.

Because <alpha | psi> = cos(phi)/N, and < -alpha | psi> = sin(phi)/N.

So, the matrix is:

rho = [ [ |a|^2, a b* ],
         [ a* b, |b|^2 ] ]

Which, for our values, becomes:

a = cos(phi) / N = (sqrt(2)/2) / 0.6275 ≈ (0.7071) / 0.6275 ≈ 1.127.

Similarly, b = sin(phi) / N = (-sqrt(2)/2) / 0.6275 ≈ (-0.7071)/0.6275 ≈ -1.127.

So, |a|^2 = |b|^2 ≈ (1.127)^2 ≈ 1.2705.

The off-diagonal elements are a*b* = (1.127)(-1.127) ≈ -1.2705.

So, the rho matrix is:

[ [ 1.2705, -1.2705 ],
  [ -1.2705, 1.2705 ] ].

Wait, but the trace is 1.2705 + 1.2705 = 2.541, which is greater than 1. That can't be correct. So again, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait a minute. No, because a = cos(phi) / N, and N is sqrt(1 + ...), which is about 0.6275. So cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, so a = 0.7071 / 0.6275 ≈ 1.127. But that would mean |a|^2 = (1.127)^2 ≈ 1.27, and same for |b|^2. So rho would have diagonal elements 1.27 and off-diagonal -1.27. But the sum is 2.54, which is greater than 1. So this isn't a valid density matrix.

This suggests a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should use a different normalization.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that N is the normalization for the entire state, so the probabilities in the basis states are (cos^2(phi)/N^2) and (sin^2(phi)/N^2). But since N^2 is 0.3935, and cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi) are 0.5 each, each of these terms is 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈1.27, which again sums to 2.54. This doesn't make sense because the trace should be 1.

Ah! I think the mistake is that the basis states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal when alpha is real. Wait, no, coherent states are over-complete and not orthogonal. So, in the density matrix, when expressed in the coherent state basis, the diagonal elements are not the probabilities.

Therefore, my approach is flawed because the basis is not orthonormal, so the matrix elements don't directly represent probabilities. This complicates things a lot, making it hard to compute the entropy directly.

Perhaps a better approach is to compute the Wigner function and see if it's Gaussian, but this is getting too involved for me.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier calculations suggest it's a superposition of coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when alpha is real and phi is -pi/4, the state |psi> ends up being another Gaussian state. For example, if you have a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, it might form another coherent state or a squeezed state, which are Gaussian.

Wait, let's think about that. Consider |psi> = (|alpha> + |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2). Then, is this state Gaussian?

Let me compute it. |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another. Their sum divided by sqrt(2) is (|alpha> + |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) = (e^{a} + e^{-a}) / sqrt(2) |0> ??? Not exactly, because coherent states are superpositions of number states. But perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed state.

Wait, yes! I remember that a squeezed state can be written as a superposition of two coherent states. For example, the squeezed vacuum state can be expressed as (|r> + (-1)^{something} | -r> ) / sqrt{2}, where r is a real parameter. So, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. That would make the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, that would make sense because a squeezed state is Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero. So the answer would be D)0.

But how can I verify this?

Wait, a squeezed state is usually written in terms of ladder operators. Let me think.

The squeezed vacuum state is S(r)|0>, where S(r) is the squeezing operator. Expanding this, it can be written as a superposition of even or odd coherent states. For real r, it's a superposition of |r> and |-r> multiplied by a factor.

So, if the state |psi> is a squeezed state, it would be a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

So in this problem, with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is a squeezed state, making the non-Gaussianity zero. So the correct answer is D)0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we analyze the state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)\exp(-2\alpha^2)}\). The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Normalization Constant \(N\):**
   - For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
     \[
     \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad \exp(-2\alpha^2) = \exp(-0.5) \approx 0.6065.
     \]
     \[
     N^2 = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 0.3935, \quad N \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
     \]

2. **Structure of \(|\psi\rangle\):**
   - Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
     \]
     Using \(\cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(-\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2\), the state becomes:
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
     \]

3. **Density Matrix \(\rho\):**
   - The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is a pure state. For pure states, the von Neumann entropy \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\).

4. **Reference Gaussian State \(\tau\):**
   - The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is typically the closest Gaussian state to \(\rho\). For a superposition of coherent states, the non-Gaussianity arises from the interference terms in \(\rho\). However, when \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state simplifies to a squeezed state, which is a Gaussian state.

5. **Non-Gaussianity Calculation:**
   - Since the state \(|\psi\rangle\) reduces to a squeezed state for \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), it is Gaussian. For Gaussian states, the non-Gaussianity is zero because the relative entropy between a Gaussian state and itself is zero.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity of the given state is \(0\), as the state is Gaussian when \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\).

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Hmm, okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states or squeezed states, which have well-behaved density matrices in terms of their Wigner functions. Non-Gaussian states, like the Schrödinger cat state, don't have such nice properties. The non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-classical the state is, right?

The problem gives me a specific state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's. So, this is basically the difference in the von Neumann entropy between the two states.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think I need to find rho and tau first.

The state |psi> is already given, so the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. But tau is the reference Gaussian state. Hmm, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because when dealing with non-Gaussianity, the reference is often the closest Gaussian state to rho, like the one that minimizes the relative entropy. But in this problem, I think tau is given as the Gaussian state that we're comparing against. Alternatively, maybe it's the state that's the Gaussian approximation of the given state?

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to rho, and for which the relative entropy is calculated. But I'm not exactly sure how to find tau. Or maybe, in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the one that's a Gaussian version of |psi>, perhaps a coherent state or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when you have a state like |psi>, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of those two states with the same coefficients, but without the quantum interference. So, for a state |a> = c|alpha> + d|beta>, the reference Gaussian might be the classical mixture, like (c² |alpha><alpha| + d² |beta><beta|). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first moments (like the same mean photon number and quadrature variances) as rho. But I'm not too sure about that.

But wait, maybe the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to the maximum entropy Gaussian state. Or perhaps, since the state is a superposition, the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first moments as the given state. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed step by step.

Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

First, compute N. Let's calculate N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

So, phi is -pi/4. So 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1.

Exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So sin(2phi) is -1, so sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Phi is -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but wait: |alpha> is a coherent state with amplitude alpha, and |-alpha> is the coherent state with amplitude -alpha. So when phi is -pi/4, we have equal coefficients, but with opposite signs. Interesting.

So, the state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, each multiplied by sqrt(2)/2, but normalized by N ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

So rho = ( [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] [ cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ] ) / N².

Expanding that, it's ( cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N².

So rho is a 2x2 mixture of these terms. The off-diagonal terms are |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa, which are non-Gaussian because they represent interference between two coherent states. So the state rho is a pure state, but the off-diagonal terms are significant.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. I'm a bit stuck on what tau would be. I think tau is the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho. But how do I find that?

Wait, perhaps in the context of calculating relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments (like the mean photon number and the covariance matrix) as rho. Alternatively, if rho is a pure state, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: the relative entropy between rho and tau is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. But wait, no, wait: del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the difference in the entropies.

Wait, but von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). So del_b would be [ -Tr(rho ln rho) ] - [ -Tr(tau ln tau) ] = [Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho) ].

Wait, no. Let me compute del_b again. The problem states:

del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

So it's the sum of the two terms, but wait, normally the von Neumann entropy is -Tr(rho ln rho), so positive if rho is mixed. So if rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) is zero because rho is a projector, so rho ln rho is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if rho is pure, rho is a projector, so rho^2 = rho. So the eigenvalues are 1 and 0. So ln rho is ln(1) for the eigenvalue 1, which is 0, and ln(0) is undefined, but when you take Tr(rho ln rho), the eigenvalue 0 multiplied by 0 (since rho has 0s on the 0 eigenvalues) would contribute nothing. So Tr(rho ln rho) is zero when rho is pure. So del_b would be 0 - Tr(tau ln tau). But that's if rho is pure.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's think about rho being a pure state. For a pure state, rho is a projector, so it's rank 1. So Tr(rho ln rho) would be ln(1) * 1 + ln(0)*0, but the trace is only over the non-zero eigenvalues. So Tr(rho ln rho) is 0 because ln(1)=0. So del_b becomes 0 - Tr(tau ln tau). But that would mean del_b is negative because Tr(tau ln tau) is positive (since it's the entropy of a mixed state). No, wait, tau is a Gaussian state, but it can be pure or mixed.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The problem says that tau is a reference Gaussian state. The non-Gaussian state is rho, which is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state. So for rho, von Neumann entropy is zero. Then del_b = [0] - [Tr(tau ln tau)].

But that would mean that del_b is negative. But non-Gaussianity is a non-negative quantity, so perhaps I have misunderstood the definition.

Wait, perhaps the formula is del_b = Tr(tau ln(tau)) - Tr(rho ln rho). Because then, if rho is pure, its entropy is zero, so del_b equals the entropy of tau. But that's not making sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the relative entropy formula. The relative entropy between two states rho and sigma is defined as S(rho || sigma) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln sigma)) ). So it's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln sigma). But in this problem, the formula given is del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's the reverse of the standard relative entropy. Hmm.

Wait, if del_b is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau), then if rho is a pure state and tau is a mixed state, rho's entropy is zero, and tau's entropy is positive. So del_b would be negative. But that can't be the case for non-Gaussianity, which should be a positive quantity. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition of del_b. Let me re-read the question. The question says, "del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state."

So according to the problem, del_b is the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy. But if rho is pure, its entropy is zero. So del_b would be negative if tau is mixed. But non-Gaussian states are supposed to have higher non-Gaussianity, so I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the reference Gaussian state, but taken as a positive quantity. So perhaps del_b is |Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)|. But the problem statement doesn't say that. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being defined differently, such as S(tau || rho), which would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho). But in that case, if rho is pure and tau is a Gaussian approximation, maybe it's positive.

But the problem says it's rho and tau, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the negative of the standard relative entropy. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, let's think differently. Perhaps I can compute the non-Gaussianity without computing all the terms, maybe for specific values of phi and alpha. The given phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5.

First, let's compute N.

As I did before: sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N² = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

The state is |psi> = [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So, |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states with equal amplitudes (but opposite signs) divided by a normalization constant.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. So, the entropy Tr(rho ln rho) is zero, as rho is a projector.

So del_b, according to the formula given, would be 0 - Tr(tau ln tau).

But that would mean del_b is negative, which doesn't make sense for non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy from the non-Gaussian state to the Gaussian state, which would be the standard relative entropy S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in the problem, it's given as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually defining non-Gaussianity as the difference in entropies in a way that's non-negative. So perhaps when rho is non-Gaussian, its entropy minus that of a Gaussian state would be positive. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute del_b as the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, which is defined as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state.

Hmm. Another thought: the non-Gaussianity can also be computed as the minimum of the relative entropy between rho and all possible Gaussian states tau. So, del_b would be the minimal value of S(rho || tau) over all Gaussian tau.

But in this problem, we're given a specific rho and a specific tau. So maybe tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho, and we need to compute the relative entropy between them.

In that case, perhaps rho is a pure state, and tau is the optimal Gaussian approximation. But I'm not sure how to compute tau.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same mean, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. For a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity is due to the interference terms in the density matrix. The relative entropy will measure how much the state deviates from Gaussian.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps in this specific case, when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is something that can be compared to a specific Gaussian state.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, it's a symmetric case. Let me think about the structure of rho. rho has terms |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, and the cross terms |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|.

In the density matrix, the cross terms are non-Gaussian because Gaussian states (like coherent states) don't have such terms when expressed in a basis of coherent states. So the non-Gaussian part is in the off-diagonal terms.

But to compute the relative entropy, I need to compute the entropies of rho and tau. Since rho is a pure state, as I said earlier, its entropy is zero. So if tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state (or a mixture), but then its entropy might be non-zero.

Wait, but if tau is a pure Gaussian state, like a coherent state, then its entropy would be zero. So del_b would be 0 -0 =0, which would correspond to option D. But that can't be right because the state rho is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting it wrong because tau is not a pure state. Maybe tau is a mixed Gaussian state that best approximates rho.

Wait, another approach: The state |psi> is a superposition state, so it's a pure state. The reference Gaussian state would be the state with the same first moments (like the first moments of position and momentum) as rho, but without the quantum interference terms. So, perhaps the reference Gaussian tau is the state which is a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha> with the same probabilities as rho.

Wait, rho is a pure state, so the probabilities are cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi), but normalized by N². Wait, no, because N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)), which depends on phi and alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum likelihood Gaussian state that approximates rho. For a two-mode state, perhaps the reference Gaussian is the state where the off-diagonal terms are set to zero, leaving only the diagonal terms. So in that case, tau would be (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) / 2, assuming equal probabilities. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a Gaussian state that matches the moments of rho, such as the first and second moments. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Let's think about what happens when the state is a coherent state. If the state is |alpha>, then it's a Gaussian state, so non-Gaussianity would be zero. But in our case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian, so non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0, which would be the case if the state was Gaussian. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is zero only when the state is Gaussian. But in this case, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian, leading to non-zero non-Gaussianity. So del_b should be non-zero.

But how to compute it numerically?

Wait, perhaps the state is such that the cross terms in rho are zero, making rho a mixture of two coherent states, which would make it a Gaussian state. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, let me compute the cross terms. The cross terms are [ cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(- alpha²) times e^{alpha (-alpha)*} + ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps the off-diagonal terms in rho involve terms like <alpha| -alpha> which are exp(-|alpha + alpha|^2 /2) because the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-|alpha + alpha|^2 / 2) = exp(- (2 alpha)^2 / 2 ) = exp(-2 alpha²).

Wait, no, the inner product <alpha | beta> is exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha beta^* ). So for beta = -alpha, <alpha| -alpha> = exp( - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha (-alpha)^* ) = exp( - alpha^2 + (- alpha^2) )? Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, alpha is a real number in this context because the coherent state is usually parametrized by a real alpha in the position quadrature. Or perhaps it's complex, but in this case, the problem uses alpha and -alpha, which are real and negative.

So, <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + | -alpha |^2 ) / 2 + alpha (-alpha)^* ) = exp( - (2 alpha^2 ) /2 + alpha (-alpha) ) = exp( - alpha² - alpha² ) = exp(-2 alpha²).

So, the off-diagonal term in rho is [ cos(phi) sin(phi) ] (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) / N², multiplied by exp(-2 alpha²).

So rho has these non-diagonal terms, making it non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau, perhaps, is a mixture of |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha|, but without the cross terms. So, tau would be [ |alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ] / 2, assuming equal probabilities.

Wait, but the probabilities in rho are cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi), divided by N^2. So, perhaps the reference state tau is a mixture with the same weights as rho's diagonal terms.

Wait, considering that, let's compute the diagonal terms of rho. The diagonal elements are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|, divided by N². So the probabilities are (cos² phi / N²) and (sin² phi / N²).

So the reference Gaussian state tau would be a classical mixture of these two coherent states with the same probabilities as in rho. So, tau = [ cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / (cos²(phi) + sin²(phi)), but since cos² + sin² =1, it's just tau = cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha|.

Wait, but N² is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). So, in our case, phi is -pi/4, so cos^2(phi) is 0.5, and sin^2(phi) is 0.5.

So tau becomes 0.5 |0.5><0.5| + 0.5 |-0.5><-0.5|.

Now, each of these is a coherent state, which is Gaussian, so the mixture tau is also a Gaussian state.

So, rho is a pure state, tau is a mixed Gaussian state.

So, to compute del_b, we have del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

But rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b becomes 0 - Tr(tau ln tau).

What is Tr(tau ln tau)?

Since tau is a mixed state of two pure states with equal probabilities (0.5 each), the entropy S(tau) is -0.5 ln 0.5 -0.5 ln 0.5 = ln 2 ≈ 0.6931.

So Tr(tau ln tau) = S(tau) = ln 2. So del_b = 0 - ln 2 ≈ -0.6931.

But non-Gaussianity is supposed to be a positive measure, so perhaps the definition is the absolute value. So |del_b| would be approximately 0.6931, which is about 0.69.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.25, option C is 1.38, which is about twice 0.69. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake. Because the definition of del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b would be negative, but non-Gaussianity is the absolute value, so perhaps the correct non-Gaussianity is the absolute value. So nG = |del_b|= ln 2 ≈0.693.

But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option B (0.25) or C (1.38). Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the reference Gaussian state. Maybe the reference state isn't a mixture of the coherent states. Maybe it's a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same mean photon number as rho.

Wait, the mean photon number for rho would be the same as the mean photon number of the reference Gaussian state. So perhaps we need to compute the photon number for rho.

The photon number for rho can be calculated as Tr(rho a† a), where a† is the creation operator and a is the annihilation operator.

But rho is |psi><psi|, so Tr(rho a† a) = <psi| a† a |psi>.

So let's compute that.

For a coherent state |beta>, a |beta> = beta |beta>.

So, for |alpha>, a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>,

Similarly, for |-alpha>, a |-alpha> = -alpha |-alpha>.

So, compute <psi | a† a | psi>.

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So, <psi | a† a | psi> = (1/N²) [ cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] a† a [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ].

Expanding this, it's (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a† a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a† a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha| a† a |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha| a† a |-alpha> ].

Now, a† a |alpha> = alpha a |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>.

Similarly, a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

So, <alpha| a† a |alpha> = alpha^2.

< -alpha | a† a | -alpha> = alpha^2.

What about <alpha | a† a |-alpha>?

a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

So <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha> = alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2).

Similarly for the other term.

Putting it all together:

<psi | a† a | psi> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) alpha^2 + cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin^2(phi) alpha^2 ].

Factor out alpha^2:

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ cos^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) + sin^2(phi) ].

Wait, cos(phi) sin(phi) + sin(phi) cos(phi) = 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = sin(2 phi).

So,

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

But cos² + sin² =1, so this becomes:

= (alpha^2 / N²) [ 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ].

Wait, but N² is 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2).

So, substituting, we get:

= (alpha^2 / N²) * N² = alpha^2.

So, the mean photon number for rho is alpha^2.

In our case, alpha=0.5, so alpha^2 =0.25. So the mean photon number is 0.25.

Now, the maximum entropy Gaussian state with this mean photon number is a coherent state with the same mean, right? Because the maximum entropy state for a given mean (and perhaps variance, but Gaussian states are determined by mean and covariance matrix) is the coherent state.

Wait, but the coherent state has mean photon number |alpha|^2, yes. So in this case, the maximum entropy Gaussian state with mean photon number 0.25 would be |0.5>, a coherent state.

Alternatively, the reference Gaussian state could be the maximum entropy state given the same first moments, which in this case would be a coherent state |0.5>.

So, if tau is |0.5><0.5|, a pure Gaussian state, then Tr(tau ln tau) is zero because it's a pure state.

So del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)] = 0 - 0 =0.

But that can't be right because rho is non-Gaussian, so its non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Another approach: perhaps the relative entropy measure is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state.

In that case, the non-Gaussianity would be the minimum relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's challenging to compute this.

Wait, maybe in this specific scenario, when phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is such that the relative entropy becomes zero. But why would that be?

Wait, earlier when we assumed tau was a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, then the non-Gaussianity was positive. But if tau is the coherent state |0.5>, then del_b would be zero, which is option D.

But why would the non-Gaussianity be zero in this case? Because the state rho is a superposition, which is non-Gaussian, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a superposition but phi is such that the cross terms vanish, but that's not the case here with phi=-pi/4.

Wait, perhaps there's a symmetry when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5 that makes the non-Gaussianity zero. But I can't think why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero. That would imply that the state is Gaussian, but I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state, making it Gaussian. Let's see.

|psi> = [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / N.

If we take N as sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-0.5)).

But that's a superposition of two different coherent states, so it's not a coherent state itself. So it's a non-Gaussian state.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is an eigenstate of some observable, making it Gaussian, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the calculation for the non-Gaussianity ends up being zero because the entropy terms cancel out. But earlier I thought that when rho is pure and tau is pure, then del_b would be zero, but in that case, since both are pure, del_b would be zero, but rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy directly. Let me think about how to compute S(rho) and S(tau).

But rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. tau is a Gaussian state, which is a mixture of two coherent states. The entropy of tau is S(tau) = -p ln p - (1-p) ln (1-p), where p is the probability of each state in the mixture. In our case, p=0.5, so S(tau)= ln 2 ≈ 0.6931.

So del_b = 0 - 0.6931 = -0.6931. But non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so perhaps it's the absolute value, which would be 0.6931. But none of the options match exactly. The options are A)2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value of N when phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2)=-1.

alpha=0.5, so alpha²=0.25. 2 alpha²=0.5, so exp(-0.5)=1/sqrt(e)≈0.6065.

So N²=1 + (-1)(0.6065)=0.3935. So N≈0.6275.

Then, the probabilities are (cos²(phi) / N²) and (sin²(phi)/N²).

Phi is -pi/4, cos^2(phi)=0.5, sin^2(phi)=0.5.

So the probabilities in rho are 0.5/(0.3935)≈1.2705 and same for the other term. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no: rho is |psi><psi|, so the diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| / N² and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha| / N². So the probabilities are (cos^2 phi)/ N² and (sin² phi)/ N². But since N² <1, these probabilities sum to (cos² + sin²)/ N² =1/(N²) >1. That can't be correct because probabilities in a density matrix must sum to 1.

Wait, that suggests I'm making a mistake. The diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| / N² and |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha| / N². But the matrix elements are not probabilities. The probabilities would be Tr(rho_P), where rho_P is the density matrix projected onto the position basis or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the diagonal terms in the density matrix in the coherent state basis are not the same as probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should think of rho as a 2x2 matrix in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}.

So, rho can be written as a 2x2 matrix:

rho = [ [ |cos(phi)|^2, cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha²) ],
         [ sin(phi) cos(phi) exp(-2 alpha²), |sin(phi)|^2 ] ] / N².

Because the off-diagonal terms are (cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha²)) in both positions because <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 alpha²), as I computed earlier.

So, when phi=-pi/4, cos(phi)=sin(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, and exp(-2 alpha²)=exp(-0.5)=approx 0.6065.

So, the matrix becomes:

rho = [ [ (0.5 / N² ), (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / N² ],
         [ (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / N², 0.5 / N² ] ].

N² is 0.3935, so 1/N²≈2.541.

So, rho ≈ [ [ 0.5 * 2.541, 0.5*0.6065 * 2.541 ],
            [ 0.5*0.6065 *2.541, 0.5 *2.541 ] ] ≈ [ [ 1.2705, 0.7693 ],
            [ 0.7693, 1.2705 ] ].

Wait, but wait. The diagonal elements are (0.5 / 0.3935) ≈1.2705, and the off-diagonal elements are (0.5 * 0.6065 ) / 0.3935 ≈ (0.30325) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.7693.

But wait, the trace should be 1. Let's check: 1.2705 + 1.2705 = 2.541, which is greater than 1. So that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait, I think the mistake is that in the matrix, the diagonal terms are |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2 multiplied by 1/N², which is 1/(0.3935)≈2.541. But since cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi) are each 0.5, the diagonal terms are 0.5 * 2.541 ≈1.2705 each. But that would make the trace of rho equal to approximately 2.541, which is impossible because rho must be a valid density matrix with trace 1.

Ah, I see where I went wrong. The correct expression is rho = [ [ cos^2(phi), cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) ],
                                                          [ sin(phi) cos(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2), sin^2(phi) ] ] / N².

Wait, no, wait. The actual matrix is:

rho_ij = [ |<alpha| psi>|^2, <alpha| psi> <psi| -alpha> ]
         [ < -alpha | psi> <psi | alpha>, |< -alpha | psi> |^2 ]

But |<alpha | psi> |^2 = [ cos^2(phi) + <alpha | - alpha> sin(phi) cos(phi) ] / N².

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The correct way to construct rho is in the basis of |alpha> and |-alpha>.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N.

So, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which in the basis { |alpha>, |-alpha> } is a 2x2 matrix:

rho = [ [ |a|^2, a b* ],
         [ a* b, |b|^2 ] ]

where a = cos(phi) / N and b = sin(phi) / N.

Because <alpha | psi> = cos(phi)/N, and < -alpha | psi> = sin(phi)/N.

So, the matrix is:

rho = [ [ |a|^2, a b* ],
         [ a* b, |b|^2 ] ]

Which, for our values, becomes:

a = cos(phi) / N = (sqrt(2)/2) / 0.6275 ≈ (0.7071) / 0.6275 ≈ 1.127.

Similarly, b = sin(phi) / N = (-sqrt(2)/2) / 0.6275 ≈ (-0.7071)/0.6275 ≈ -1.127.

So, |a|^2 = |b|^2 ≈ (1.127)^2 ≈ 1.2705.

The off-diagonal elements are a*b* = (1.127)(-1.127) ≈ -1.2705.

So, the rho matrix is:

[ [ 1.2705, -1.2705 ],
  [ -1.2705, 1.2705 ] ].

Wait, but the trace is 1.2705 + 1.2705 = 2.541, which is greater than 1. That can't be correct. So again, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait a minute. No, because a = cos(phi) / N, and N is sqrt(1 + ...), which is about 0.6275. So cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, so a = 0.7071 / 0.6275 ≈ 1.127. But that would mean |a|^2 = (1.127)^2 ≈ 1.27, and same for |b|^2. So rho would have diagonal elements 1.27 and off-diagonal -1.27. But the sum is 2.54, which is greater than 1. So this isn't a valid density matrix.

This suggests a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should use a different normalization.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that N is the normalization for the entire state, so the probabilities in the basis states are (cos^2(phi)/N^2) and (sin^2(phi)/N^2). But since N^2 is 0.3935, and cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi) are 0.5 each, each of these terms is 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈1.27, which again sums to 2.54. This doesn't make sense because the trace should be 1.

Ah! I think the mistake is that the basis states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal when alpha is real. Wait, no, coherent states are over-complete and not orthogonal. So, in the density matrix, when expressed in the coherent state basis, the diagonal elements are not the probabilities.

Therefore, my approach is flawed because the basis is not orthonormal, so the matrix elements don't directly represent probabilities. This complicates things a lot, making it hard to compute the entropy directly.

Perhaps a better approach is to compute the Wigner function and see if it's Gaussian, but this is getting too involved for me.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier calculations suggest it's a superposition of coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when alpha is real and phi is -pi/4, the state |psi> ends up being another Gaussian state. For example, if you have a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, it might form another coherent state or a squeezed state, which are Gaussian.

Wait, let's think about that. Consider |psi> = (|alpha> + |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2). Then, is this state Gaussian?

Let me compute it. |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another. Their sum divided by sqrt(2) is (|alpha> + |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) = (e^{a} + e^{-a}) / sqrt(2) |0> ??? Not exactly, because coherent states are superpositions of number states. But perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed state.

Wait, yes! I remember that a squeezed state can be written as a superposition of two coherent states. For example, the squeezed vacuum state can be expressed as (|r> + (-1)^{something} | -r> ) / sqrt{2}, where r is a real parameter. So, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. That would make the non-Gaussianity zero.

Wait, that would make sense because a squeezed state is Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero. So the answer would be D)0.

But how can I verify this?

Wait, a squeezed state is usually written in terms of ladder operators. Let me think.

The squeezed vacuum state is S(r)|0>, where S(r) is the squeezing operator. Expanding this, it can be written as a superposition of even or odd coherent states. For real r, it's a superposition of |r> and |-r> multiplied by a factor.

So, if the state |psi> is a squeezed state, it would be a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

So in this problem, with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is a squeezed state, making the non-Gaussianity zero. So the correct answer is D)0.


To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we analyze the state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)\exp(-2\alpha^2)}\). The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Steps and Analysis:
1. **Normalization Constant \(N\):**
   - For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
     \[
     \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad \exp(-2\alpha^2) = \exp(-0.5) \approx 0.6065.
     \]
     \[
     N^2 = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 0.3935, \quad N \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
     \]

2. **Structure of \(|\psi\rangle\):**
   - Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
     \]
     Using \(\cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(-\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2\), the state becomes:
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 \cdot |-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
     \]

3. **Density Matrix \(\rho\):**
   - The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is a pure state. For pure states, the von Neumann entropy \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\).

4. **Reference Gaussian State \(\tau\):**
   - The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is typically the closest Gaussian state to \(\rho\). For a superposition of coherent states, the non-Gaussianity arises from the interference terms in \(\rho\). However, when \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state simplifies to a squeezed state, which is a Gaussian state.

5. **Non-Gaussianity Calculation:**
   - Since the state \(|\psi\rangle\) reduces to a squeezed state for \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), it is Gaussian. For Gaussian states, the non-Gaussianity is zero because the relative entropy between a Gaussian state and itself is zero.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity of the given state is \(0\), as the state is Gaussian when \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\).
