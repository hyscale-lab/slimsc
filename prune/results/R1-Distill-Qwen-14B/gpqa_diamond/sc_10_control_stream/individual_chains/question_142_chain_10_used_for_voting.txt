Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's start by recalling what I know about density matrices.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but when you have a mixture, like this one, it's a statistical ensemble.

Wait, this ρ looks like a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 is the same as taking ½ |0><0| + ½ |1><1|. So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I think the Bloch sphere is used to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it's represented as a point on the surface of the sphere, with coordinates (x,y,z) where x = <σx>, y = <σy>, z = <σz>, and σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a density matrix ρ, the expectation values of the Pauli operators give the position on the Bloch sphere.

The density matrix for a completely mixed state should be at the origin of the Bloch sphere, right? Because a mixed state with equal probabilities of 0 and 1 would have no coherence and zero expectation for all the Pauli matrices except maybe σz? Wait, no. Wait, let me think. For a completely mixed state ρ = I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let's compute the expectation values.

The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The expectation value for each is Tr(ρ σ_i).

So let's compute each:

ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is equivalent to ( [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] ) / 2 = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]], which is indeed the identity matrix multiplied by ½.

So for each Pauli matrix σ_i, Tr(ρ σ_i) = Tr( (I/2) σ_i ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_i). The trace of any Pauli matrix is zero because σx and σy have trace zero, and σz has trace (1 + (-1)) = 0. So all the expectation values are zero.

Wait, that means the point on the Bloch sphere would be (0,0,0). Because the Bloch vector components are the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So the state is at the center. 

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the Bloch sphere is defined. Let me double-check. The Bloch vector r for a qubit is given by <σx>, <σy>, <σz>. So when ρ is diagonal and all its off-diagonal terms are zero (which they are here), the coherences are zero, so there are no x or y components. The diagonal terms? Let's see, the expectation value of σz is Tr(ρ σz) = (½)(1) + (½)(-1) ) = 0. So same as before, all components are zero.

So yes, the state is at the origin. Therefore, the correct option is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right),
\]

which represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. This state can also be written as \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The Bloch sphere is used to represent qubit states, where the coordinates of a point on the sphere correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\). 

To determine the geometrical position of \(\rho\) on the Bloch sphere, we compute the expectation values of the Pauli matrices:

1. For \(\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\),  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{I}{2} \sigma_x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_x) = 0.
   \]

2. For \(\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}\),  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{I}{2} \sigma_y\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_y) = 0.
   \]

3. For \(\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\),  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{I}{2} \sigma_z\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_z) = 0.
   \]

Since all expectation values are zero, the Bloch vector corresponding to this state is \((0, 0, 0)\), which represents the origin of the Bloch sphere. This confirms that the state is at the center of the qubit space.
