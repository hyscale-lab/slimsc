Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable is represented by matrix P, which has certain elements. I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, and the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's component in the state.

Wait, but wait. The system's state is given as a column vector, which I think is a state vector. So, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. But wait, I should check if this state is normalized. Because probabilities are based on normalized states.

To check normalization, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself. So, that's (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state isn't normalized. So, perhaps I should normalize it first. Because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector.

Wait, but wait. The observable's matrix is given as P. The question is about the probability of measuring 0 when P is measured. So, I think I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then find the projection of the state onto that eigenspace.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value, but no, I need the probability. Hmm.

So, the steps I think I should follow are:

1. Check if the state is normalized. If not, normalize it. But wait, sometimes state vectors aren't required to be normalized unless specified. But for probabilities, we might have to normalize, because probabilities sum to 1.

Wait, the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]. Its norm squared is 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So, the normalized state would be 1/sqrt(6) times that vector. So |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But I'm not sure whether I need to do this because the problem might already have normalized the state. Wait, the problem gives the state as (-1,2,1), but perhaps it's already a normalized vector. Let me check: 1^2 +2^2 +1^2 = sqrt(6), so the length is sqrt(6), so it's not normalized. So, when calculating probabilities, I should probably normalize it.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P is the observable, and the eigenvalues are the possible outcomes. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has eigenvalues, and the probability of getting 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections onto the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, maybe I should first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The matrix P is given as:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, let me write this matrix explicitly.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

So, this is a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about its properties. It looks symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

So, the matrix (P-λ I) would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ    1/√2    0     |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |
| 0    1/√2  -λ    |

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me expand it.

The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Let me denote the matrix as:

a11 a12 a13

a21 a22 a23

a31 a32 a33

So, determinant is a11*(a22 a33 - a23 a32) - a12*(a21 a33 - a23 a31) + a13*(a21 a32 - a22 a31)

In our case,

a11 = -λ, a12=1/√2, a13=0

a21=1/√2, a22=-λ, a23=1/√2

a31=0, a32=1/√2, a33=-λ

So determinant is:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]

+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Which simplifies to:

(-λ) [ λ^2 - (1/2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ) ]

So:

= (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 )

= (-λ³ + (λ)/2 ) + (λ/2 )

Wait, because (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) is (-λ)/(2), so the second term is -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So,

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Combine the terms:

= -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 

= -λ^3 + λ

So, determinant equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) =0 → λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So, the possible outcomes when measuring the observable P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 and then compute the projection of the state onto this eigenspace.

Wait, but wait, the eigenspace for λ=0. Since P is a Hermitian matrix, each eigenvalue's eigenspace is orthogonal.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

So, (P) |v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So, the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 =0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → v1*(1, 0, -1).

But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can write the eigenvector as (1, 0, -1). Let's check:

P (1, 0, -1)^T = [ (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1)), (1/√2 *1 + 0*0 + 1/√2*(-1)), (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)) ] → [0, (1/√2 -1/√2), 0 ] → [0,0,0], which is correct.

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1,0,-1).

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, but earlier I thought it's not normalized. So, to compute the probability, I should normalize |ψ>.

Compute the norm: |ψ| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of λ=0 is the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector |v> (since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and |v> is a basis vector for it).

So, the projection amplitude is <v| ψ> . The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So, let's compute <v|ψ>.

The eigenvector |v> is (1, 0, -1), but I should normalize it as well, right? Because the eigenvector I found is (1,0,-1), but since eigenvectors can have any non-zero length.

Wait, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so any non-zero multiple of (1,0,-1) is acceptable. So, to compute the projection, I can take the inner product of |v> (normalized) and |ψ> (normalized).

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the eigenvector |v> is (1,0,-1), but its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) (1,0,-1).

So, the projection of |ψ> onto |v> is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) (1,0,-1) · ( [-1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6) )

Dot product is (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

= ( -1 + 0 -1 ) / ( sqrt(12) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

The amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

Wait, because (1/sqrt(3))^2 is 1/3, and the square of -1 is 1.

So, the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So, the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector \( |ψ\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The problem focuses on the eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( P \) for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvectors are of the form \( |v\rangle = [v_1, 0, -v_1]^T \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the state vector \( |ψ\rangle \)
The given state vector is \( |ψ\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). Its norm is:

\[
\| |ψ\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection of \( |ψ\rangle \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( |ψ\rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The projection amplitude is:

\[
\langle v | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Performing the dot product:

\[
\langle v | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = |\langle v | ψ \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

But I'm not sure whether I need to do this because the problem might already have normalized the state. Wait, the problem gives the state as (-1,2,1), but perhaps it's already a normalized vector. Let me check: 1^2 +2^2 +1^2 = sqrt(6), so the length is sqrt(6), so it's not normalized. So, when calculating probabilities, I should probably normalize it.

Alternatively, maybe the matrix P is the observable, and the eigenvalues are the possible outcomes. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P has eigenvalues, and the probability of getting 0 is the sum of the squares of the projections onto the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

So, maybe I should first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The matrix P is given as:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, let me write this matrix explicitly.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

So, this is a 3x3 matrix. Let me think about its properties. It looks symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

So, the matrix (P-λ I) would be:

[
[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]
]

The determinant of this matrix is:

| -λ    1/√2    0     |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2 |
| 0    1/√2  -λ    |

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Let me expand it.

The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Let me denote the matrix as:

a11 a12 a13

a21 a22 a23

a31 a32 a33

So, determinant is a11*(a22 a33 - a23 a32) - a12*(a21 a33 - a23 a31) + a13*(a21 a32 - a22 a31)

In our case,

a11 = -λ, a12=1/√2, a13=0

a21=1/√2, a22=-λ, a23=1/√2

a31=0, a32=1/√2, a33=-λ

So determinant is:

(-λ) * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]

+ 0 * [ ... ] 

Which simplifies to:

(-λ) [ λ^2 - (1/2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ) ]

So:

= (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 )

= (-λ³ + (λ)/2 ) + (λ/2 )

Wait, because (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) is (-λ)/(2), so the second term is -(1/√2)*(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So,

= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

Combine the terms:

= -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 

= -λ^3 + λ

So, determinant equation is:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) =0 → λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So, the possible outcomes when measuring the observable P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0 and then compute the projection of the state onto this eigenspace.

Wait, but wait, the eigenspace for λ=0. Since P is a Hermitian matrix, each eigenvalue's eigenspace is orthogonal.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

So, (P) |v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0.

So, the system of equations is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3 )=0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0 v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0 v3 =0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

So, the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → v1*(1, 0, -1).

But since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar, we can write the eigenvector as (1, 0, -1). Let's check:

P (1, 0, -1)^T = [ (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1)), (1/√2 *1 + 0*0 + 1/√2*(-1)), (0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)) ] → [0, (1/√2 -1/√2), 0 ] → [0,0,0], which is correct.

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1,0,-1).

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, but earlier I thought it's not normalized. So, to compute the probability, I should normalize |ψ>.

Compute the norm: |ψ| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So, the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Now, the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenspace of λ=0 is the inner product of |ψ> with the eigenvector |v> (since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and |v> is a basis vector for it).

So, the projection amplitude is <v| ψ> . The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So, let's compute <v|ψ>.

The eigenvector |v> is (1, 0, -1), but I should normalize it as well, right? Because the eigenvector I found is (1,0,-1), but since eigenvectors can have any non-zero length.

Wait, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so any non-zero multiple of (1,0,-1) is acceptable. So, to compute the projection, I can take the inner product of |v> (normalized) and |ψ> (normalized).

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the eigenvector |v> is (1,0,-1), but its norm is sqrt(1^2 +0^2 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2). So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) (1,0,-1).

So, the projection of |ψ> onto |v> is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) (1,0,-1) · ( [-1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6) )

Dot product is (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )

= ( -1 + 0 -1 ) / ( sqrt(12) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3)

The amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/3).

Wait, because (1/sqrt(3))^2 is 1/3, and the square of -1 is 1.

So, the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

So, the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector \( |ψ\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The problem focuses on the eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvectors of \( P \) for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvectors are of the form \( |v\rangle = [v_1, 0, -v_1]^T \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the state vector \( |ψ\rangle \)
The given state vector is \( |ψ\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). Its norm is:

\[
\| |ψ\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection of \( |ψ\rangle \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \( |ψ\rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( |v\rangle \). The projection amplitude is:

\[
\langle v | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Performing the dot product:

\[
\langle v | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(\lambda = 0) = |\langle v | ψ \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Answer: C
