Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the state vector. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), right?

So, to find ΔP_z, I need to calculate ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩. But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, what does that mean for P_z? Oh, right, because P_x and P_z are components of the angular momentum operator, which are different, so they don't necessarily commute. So, the expectation value of P_z in this state isn't zero, but I'll have to compute it using the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩. 

First, I think I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ⟩. To do this, I can compute ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Wait, but looking at the matrix P_z, it's diagonal because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each diagonal element corresponds to the eigenvalues. The P_z matrix is:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis states. The state vector given is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )^T, which I think is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, but the state is given as the eigenstate of P_x. So I should probably check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

Calculating the norm: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) = 1/2, plus 1/2 gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. That's good.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can use the formula:

⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies to the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z. Let me break that down.

The components of ψ are:
ψ₁ = -1/2,
ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2),
ψ₃ = -1/2.

Each component squared (since P_z is diagonal, we just multiply each by their eigenvalue):

ψ₁² * (ħ) for first term,
ψ₂² * (0),
ψ₃² * (-ħ).

Wait, but wait—no, actually, the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So each component ψ_i is multiplied by the diagonal element P_z_ii. So let's compute each term:

Term 1: ψ₁ * P_z_11 * ψ₁^* (but since ψ is real, it's just ψ₁ * P_z_11 * ψ₁)
Term 2: ψ₂ * P_z_22 * ψ₂
Term 3: ψ₃ * P_z_33 * ψ₃

So,

Term 1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ
Term 2: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Term 3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (1/4)(-ħ) ?? Wait, wait, wait. Let me check that again.

Wait, P_z_33 is -ħ. So ψ₃ is -1/2. So term 3 is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2).

Wait, no, I think I should just compute each component as ψ_i * P_z_ii * ψ_i.

Wait, but since P_z is a matrix, when you multiply P_z by ψ, it's a vector where each component is ψ_i multiplied by the diagonal element of P_z.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute ψ† P_z ψ as the sum over i of ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i.

So, for i=1: (−1/2) * ħ * (−1/2) = (1/4) ħ
For i=2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0
For i=3: (−1/2) * (−ħ) * (−1/2) = (−1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Wait, so adding all three terms:
( ħ/4 ) + 0 + (-ħ/4 ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Interesting.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is also diagonal, with each diagonal element being (P_z_ii)^2.

So P_z² matrix is:
Row 1: (ħ^2, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, (−ħ)^2) = (ħ^2, 0, 0) for row 3.

Wait, no: (−ħ)^2 is ħ². So P_z squared is:
[ [ ħ², 0, 0],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since it's diagonal, each term is ψ_i² * (P_z²)_ii.

So:

Term 1: (−1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²
Term 2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0
Term 3: (−1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²

Sum of terms: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4 ) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )= sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0² ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me double-check each step.

1. Calculated ⟨P_z⟩: yes, each term was added correctly, leading to zero.

2. ⟨P_z²⟩: Each diagonal term squared, with the correct coefficients. So 1/4 ħ² for i=1 and i=3, adding to 1/2 ħ². That looks right.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ along the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i P_z^{ii} \psi_i,
\]

where $\psi_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$. Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot \hbar \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements $(P_z^{ii})^2$ along the diagonal, which are $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i (P_z^2)^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)^{11} = \hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2})^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z^2)^{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)^{33} = \hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2})^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Since P_z is diagonal, this simplifies to the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z. Let me break that down.

ψ₁ = -1/2,
ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2),
ψ₃ = -1/2.

Each component squared (since P_z is diagonal, we just multiply each by their eigenvalue):

ψ₁² * (ħ) for first term,
ψ₂² * (0),

Term 1: ψ₁ * P_z_11 * ψ₁^* (but since ψ is real, it's just ψ₁ * P_z_11 * ψ₁)
Term 2: ψ₂ * P_z_22 * ψ₂
Term 3: ψ₃ * P_z_33 * ψ₃

So,

Term 1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ
Term 2: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 * (1/sqrt(2)) = 0
Term 3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (1/4)(-ħ) ?? Wait, wait, wait. Let me check that again.

Wait, P_z_33 is -ħ. So ψ₃ is -1/2. So term 3 is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2).

Wait, no, I think I should just compute each component as ψ_i * P_z_ii * ψ_i.

Wait, but since P_z is a matrix, when you multiply P_z by ψ, it's a vector where each component is ψ_i multiplied by the diagonal element of P_z.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute ψ† P_z ψ as the sum over i of ψ_i^* (P_z)_ii ψ_i.

So, for i=1: (−1/2) * ħ * (−1/2) = (1/4) ħ
For i=2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0
For i=3: (−1/2) * (−ħ) * (−1/2) = (−1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Wait, so adding all three terms:
( ħ/4 ) + 0 + (-ħ/4 ) = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Interesting.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is also diagonal, with each diagonal element being (P_z_ii)^2.

So P_z² matrix is:
Row 1: (ħ^2, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, (−ħ)^2) = (ħ^2, 0, 0) for row 3.

Wait, no: (−ħ)^2 is ħ². So P_z squared is:
[ [ ħ², 0, 0],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since it's diagonal, each term is ψ_i² * (P_z²)_ii.

So:

Term 1: (−1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²
Term 2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0
Term 3: (−1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ²

Sum of terms: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4 ) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )= sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0² ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me double-check each step.

1. Calculated ⟨P_z⟩: yes, each term was added correctly, leading to zero.

2. ⟨P_z²⟩: Each diagonal term squared, with the correct coefficients. So 1/4 ħ² for i=1 and i=3, adding to 1/2 ħ². That looks right.

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ along the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i P_z^{ii} \psi_i,
\]

where $\psi_i$ are the components of $|\psi\rangle$. Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{11} = \hbar$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot \hbar \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $P_z^{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $P_z^{33} = -\hbar$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2}) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is diagonal with elements $(P_z^{ii})^2$ along the diagonal, which are $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 \psi_i (P_z^2)^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:

- For $i=1$: $\psi_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)^{11} = \hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2})^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\psi_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $(P_z^2)^{22} = 0$, so the term is $0$.
- For $i=3$: $\psi_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $(P_z^2)^{33} = \hbar^2$, so the term is $(-\frac{1}{2})^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
