Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine usually acts as an electrophile in these reactions, and where the substitution happens depends on the directing groups already present on the benzene ring.

The question provides six different benzene derivatives, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield after reaction with excess bromine. Wait, because it's an excess, it's probably a multiple substitution, but the question is about the para-isomer of the monobromo derivative. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, no, wait again. Oh, the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, no, that's not possible for all of them. So maybe each reaction produces one main product, and I need to find the para-isomer fraction in each case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says, "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So for each substance, when reacted with excess Br2, the main substitution is monobromination, and the para isomer is the major product or a minor? Or wait, no, maybe each substance undergoes a substitution where the para product is formed, and we have to arrange them based on how much para product each gives. So for each substituent, their directing effects determine where the Br adds.

So I need to figure out for each substituent (the groups attached to benzene), whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they direct para or ortho/para. Then, the para product's yield would depend on the substituent's directing effect.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethyl ester)
3) Cl
4) NO2
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

So, the substituent will direct the incoming Br to certain positions. Let me go one by one.

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is an activating group, since it's an electron donor. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine reacts, the Br can go ortho, meta, or para. Wait, no, methyl is activating and directs to ortho and para. So for substitution, the major products will be ortho and para. But in some cases, para might be more favored if steric hindrance or other factors are at play.

Wait, but when there's a strong activating group, the para isomer might be more prevalent than the ortho, especially when the substituent is bulky. But methyl is not too bulky. Hmm, but when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the product distribution is a mix, but for a single substituent, the para might not be the majority. Or wait, in monosubstitution, for an activating group like methyl, the para would be a major product, but maybe the ortho is even more so because it's closer? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, but for a single substituent, the para-substituted product would be the major one when the substituent is strongly activating and para is more accessible. Alternatively, perhaps for this question, it's about whether the substituent is meta or para director. Wait, all substituents except meta directors would direct to para, but wait, no, some groups are meta directors.

Wait, let's clarify each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So Br can enter at ortho, meta, or para positions? No, wait, no: for an activating group, the substitution occurs at ortho and para. So when the substituent is ortho/para, the Br adds to either ortho or para, not meta.

Wait, no, wait. For monosubstitution, the substituent directs incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions. For example, activating groups (like -CH3) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups can be either ortho/para (like -NO2, which is a strong deactivating, meta director) or meta (like -COOH, which is deactivating and meta).

Wait, wait a second, I think I have the directing effects mixed up. Let me recall:

- Activating groups (EDGs, electron-donating groups) like -CH3, -OCH3, etc., are ortho/para directors. They make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

- Deactivating groups (EWGs, electron-withdrawing groups) can be meta directors, like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, etc. For example, -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and is meta-directing. Similarly, -COOH is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but wait: some deactivating groups are para directors. For example, the halogens (-F, -Cl, etc.) are deactivating (due to inductive effect) but are ortho/para directors because of their lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making the ortho and para positions more activated.

So for each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para director.

2) COOEt: this is an ester group. The ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester group (like OCOEt) is an EWG. So for groups like -COOR (ester), they are meta directors. Because they are deactivating and meta-directing.

3) Cl: this is a halogen. It's deactivating (because of the electronegativity, inductive effect), but it's ortho/para director due to resonance. The lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons into the ring through resonance, activating the ortho and para positions.

4) NO2: nitro group. Strongly deactivating, meta director.

5) C2H5: ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's activating, ortho/para director.

6) COOH: carboxylic acid. Strongly deactivating, meta director.

Okay, so now for each substituent, I can tell where the incoming Br will go.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, when Br adds, what's the major positionâ€”para, ortho, or meta?

Wait, but the question says, after the reaction, they form only one monobromo derivative. Wait, that can't be right because in most cases, you'll get more than one isomer. But the question states that only one is formed. Hmm, maybe that's a misunderstanding on my part. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says, "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps each substituent directs the Br to one position, so all the product is one isomer. So for each substituent, the para-isomer's weight fraction is either 100% or something else, but the assumption is that only one product is formed. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing because, in reality, some substituents lead to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that each reaction gives a single major product, which could be para or another position. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, I need to determine whether the para product is the major or minor, or even if it's the only product.

Wait, but how? Let's think again.

Each substituent directs the bromine to certain positions, and the relative amounts depend on the directing.

For example, if the substituent is a strong ortho/para director, then the para product would be a major isomer. But sometimes, the ortho product might be more favored due to steric factors. For example, when the substituent is a bulky group like a tert-butyl, the para product is favored because the ortho positions are crowded.

So, for each substituent, I need to consider their directing effects and steric hindrance to determine the major product.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): methyl is a small substituent. It's an activating, ortho/para director. The incoming Br can go to ortho, para. But which is more favored? For a methyl group, I think the para position is more favored because the ortho positions are adjacent and perhaps there's less steric hindrance compared to a bulkier group, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, for a small substituent like methyl, the ortho positions are actually closer, so perhaps they are more reactive? Or maybe the para is more favored. I think, in general, for monosubstituted benzene with activating groups, the para product is the major one. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, when a substituent is an activating, ortho/para director, the Br tends to add to the para position more than the ortho, especially in the case of a single substituent. Because, in the para position, there's less steric hindrance compared to ortho. Alternatively, for small substituents, the ortho might be more reactive. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's activating nature leads to higher reactivity at ortho and para, but the para might be more favored due to being more accessible when there's no steric hindrance. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think that for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the major product is typically the para-isomer when the substituent is not too bulky. For instance, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para-bromination is the major product because the methyl group is small, so the para position is more accessible than the ortho, which would be next to the methyl.

Wait, but I've read before that the major product in toluene bromination is the para isomer. So perhaps for substituent 1, the para isomer is major.

But wait, no, wait. Another source says that the major product for toluene bromination is the ortho and para, but the majority is para because it's more favored when the substituent directs but the position is more accessible. Alternatively, maybe it's a 50:50, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take each substituent and figure out the para product's fraction.

Let me make a table:

Substituent | Type (activating/deactivating) | Director (ortho/para/meta) | Para product yield
--- | --- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | activating | ortho/para | high (major)
2) COOEt | deactivating | meta | no para (so 0% para)
3) Cl | deactivating | ortho/para | major (para)
4) NO2 | deactivating | meta | no para (so 0% para)
5) C2H5 | activating | ortho/para | high (para)
6) COOH | deactivating | meta | no para (0%)

Wait, but that can't be right because substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para products would be minimal. So for substituents 2,4,6, the para product isn't formed, so the weight fraction is 0%? But that's probably not correct because in meta directors, the substituent directs to meta, so the para would be minor, but is there any para product?

Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully. For a meta-directing group, the incoming electrophile goes to the meta position relative to the substituent. So in that case, the product would be meta, and the para product would be a minor isomer or perhaps not formed at all. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terminology.

Wait, wait. Let's take substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). It's a meta director. So when Br adds, it would add to the meta position relative to the ester group. So the product would be meta-bromo with respect to COOEt. So the para position relative to the ester group would not be a major product. Therefore, the para product isn't formed in this case. So the weight fraction of the para-isomer would be 0%.

Same for substituent 4, NO2: meta director. So Br adds meta to NO2. So no para product.

Substituent 6: COOH is a meta director, so Br adds meta to COOH. So no para product.

So for substituents 2,4,6, the para product's yield isn't formed, so their weight fraction is 0%.

Wait, but that can't be the case because in the options, all substituents are ordered with some fractions. Alternatively, perhaps para product is present but in negligible amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents can lead to a little para product, but it's minor. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, so if a substituent leads to mostly meta product, the para would contribute a small fraction.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents can lead to some para product, but the major is elsewhere. So for substituent 2, the major product is meta, but there would be minor para and ortho products.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, I need to figure out how much para product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps if the substituent is a meta director, the para product isn't formed, so the weight fraction is 0%.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me go back to each substituent:

1) CH3: ortho/para director. So when Br adds, it can go ortho or para. The major product is para because it's less hindered. So for substituent 1, the para product is a major fraction.

2) COOEt: meta director. Br adds meta to COOEt. So para product isn't formed, so 0% para.

3) Cl: ortho/para director. So Br can add ortho or para. Which is more major? Cl is a strong ortho/para director, but for para, perhaps the major product is para. Like in chlorobenzene, the major product upon bromination is para-bromochlorobenzene. So substituent 3 would have high para fraction.

4) NO2: meta director. Br adds meta, so no para. So 0% para.

5) C2H5: ortho/para director. So Br adds to ortho or para. For a larger substituent like ethyl, perhaps the para product is favored because ortho is more hindered. So substituent 5's para product is major.

6) COOH: meta director. Br adds meta, so 0% para.

Wait, so substituents 2,4,6 would have 0% para, substituents 1,3,5 would have higher para fractions.

Now, among substituents 1,3,5, which has the highest, medium, and lowest para fractions.

Substituent 1: methyl. Activating, ortho/para. Para is major.

Substituent 3: Cl. Deactivating, ortho/para. So when Br adds, it's more likely to be para than ortho because Cl is a strong deactivating group, but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, but it's a weak deactivating (due to resonance). So it's activating in comparison to NO2, but how does that affect the product distribution?

Wait, when the substituent is an activating group, the ring is more reactive, but in the case of deactivating groups like Cl, the ring is less reactive, but the incoming Br still adds ortho and para.

Wait, but for substituent 3, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So for the bromination reaction, which is an electrophilic substitution, the Cl group makes the ring less reactive than benzene but directs Br to ortho and para positions.

In such a case, which position is more favored? For Cl, the para product is typically the major isomer. For example, in chlorobenzene, bromination gives mainly para-brom chlorobenzene as the major product.

Substituent 5: ethyl group. It's an activating, ortho/para director. So when Br adds, the major product would be para, because the ethyl group is larger than methyl, so the ortho positions are more hindered, making para the major product.

So substituent 5's para product is major, perhaps more than substituent 1 (methyl) because of steric factors.

So putting it together, the order from lowest to highest para product fraction would be:

Substituents with 0% para: 2,4,6.

Then in substituents with higher para, we have 1,3,5.

But wait, substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1's.

Wait, substituent 1: methyl, which is small. So Br tends to add to ortho and para. But para is more favored because less steric hindrance. So the para product is major in this case.

Substituent 5: ethyl is larger, so para is more favored, so higher para fraction than methyl.

Substituent 3: Cl is deactivating. So para product is major, but due to deactivation, the overall reactivity is lower, but the directing effect still leads to para being major.

So among substituents 1,3,5:

Substituent 5 (ethyl) would have the highest para fraction, substituent 3 (Cl) next, and substituent 1 (methyl) the lowest. Wait, but earlier I thought substituent 1 would have a higher para fraction. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, in the case of substituent 3 (Cl), the para product is the major product due to Cl being an ortho/para director. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than substituent 1's.

Wait, but substituent 1 is activating, so the ring is more reactive, but the para fraction could be similar to substituent 3's, but perhaps in substituent 3's case, the para fraction is higher because the substituent is deactivating but still directs to para.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the actual product distributions.

For benzyl derivatives:

- Toluene (methyl benzene): Bromination gives para-bromotoluene as the major product, with some ortho and a little meta (though meta is less likely, since methyl is activating).

Wait, but actually, for toluene, the major product is para, but sometimes ortho is a significant isomer because methyl is small. But in practice, the para product is more favored due to less steric hindrance. So substituent 1 has a high para fraction.

Chlorobenzene: Bromination gives mainly para-bromo chlorobenzene as the major product, with some ortho. So substituent 3 has a high para fraction.

Ethylbenzene: Bromination would have a major para product, perhaps more than toluene because ethyl is bulkier, making ortho less favored.

So substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But substituent 3 (Cl) may have a para fraction similar to or higher than substituent 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of activating vs deactivating.

Substituent 1: Activating, so ring is more reactive. Ortho/para director. So more para product.

Substituent 3: Deactivating (but ortho/para director). So the ring is less reactive, but still, the para product is major.

Substituent 5: Activating (like 1), but ethyl is bulkier. So para is major.

So in terms of para fraction from highest to lowest:

1) substituent 5 (highest, because ethyl is bulky, so para is major)
2) substituent 3 (Cl) (moderate, but deactivating, so perhaps para is major)
3) substituent 1 (methyl) (less than 5, because less steric hindrance)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, substituent 3 (Cl) might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 because of the directing effect, even though Cl is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the order of para product fractions is:

Substituent 5 > substituent 3 > substituent 1.

Because substituent 5 is bulky, leading to more para. Substituent 3 is deactivating but still an ortho/para director, so para is major. Substituent 1 is activating but not as bulky, so para is major but perhaps less than substituent 5.

So, the substituents with the lowest para fraction are substituent 2,4,6 (0% each?), but wait, we can't have all three at 0%. So perhaps substituent 2,4,6 have lower para fractions than 1, but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). It's a meta director. So when Br adds, it adds meta to the ester group. So in this case, the para product would have Br in a position that's para to where? Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the terms.

Wait, when the substituent is a meta director, the incoming electrophile adds to the meta position relative to the substituent. So in the case of substituent 2, the Br would be meta to the ester group, but that would be the same as para to another substituent? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2's meta product is the major product, so the para product isn't formed, making the para fraction 0%.

Same for substituent 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH), so substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para fraction.

Substituents 1,3,5 have varying para fractions:

- substituent 1: methyl; para product is major, but perhaps not 100%.
- substituent 3: Cl; para product is major.
- substituent 5: ethyl; para product is major, perhaps more than substituent 3.

So, the para fractions are in the order: substituent 5 > substituent 3 > substituent 1.

But for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is 0%.

So if I'm to arrange all six substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

The order would be substituents with 0% para first, then the others.

Which substituents have 0% para? 2,4,6.

Then substituents 1,3,5.

So the sequence would be 2,4,6 (all 0%), followed by 1, 3,5.

Wait, but how do substituents 2,4,6 compare among themselves? Wait, all of them have 0% para, so their para fractions are the same. But perhaps in reality, some may have a very small amount, but the question says to assume only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

substituents 2,4,6 (0% para), then substituents 1,3,5.

But in the options, the order includes all six substituents. So looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but substituents 4,2,6 all have 0% para. So within these three, their order doesn't matter for the overall arrangement. But perhaps substituents with stronger deactivating groups or better directors could have some effect.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger meta director than 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH). So perhaps substituent 4 would have the lowest para fraction (since it's a stronger deactivating group, but already meta director, so para fraction is 0%).

Wait, but all three substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are 0%, but their actual position in the order would depend on their overall effect.

Hmm, perhaps the answer expects that substituents with stronger deactivating groups (like NO2) would have lower reactivity, but that doesn't affect the position of the para product, which is 0% for all three.

So the order would be substituents 4,2,6 (each 0%), then substituents 1,3,5 in increasing order of their para fractions (1 <3 <5).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 4,2,6 are all 0%, so they should be before 3 and 1.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No, same issue.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, same issue.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No, because substituents 6,2,4 should be early in the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is substituents 4,2,6 (0%), followed by substituent 1, then 3, then 5.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, substituent 3 (Cl) next, and substituent 1 (methyl) the lowest.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction:

Substituents 4,2,6 (0% each), then 1,3,5.

So the order would be 4=2=6 < 1 <3 <5.

But in the options, the substituents 4,2,6 are all placed before 3,1,5.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because 1 should come after 3.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because 3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para is incorrect. Maybe they do have some para product, but it's negligible, so the para fraction is very low but not zero.

In that case, substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 2,4,6.

So, the order would be substituents 2,4,6 (lowest para), then 1, then 3, then 5.

So the order from lowest to highest para:

2<4<6<1<3<5.

But looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has the lowest para fraction among the activating groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to list the substituents in order of their activating/deactivating and directing effects.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the substituent that directs to para the most would have the highest para fraction.

So the substituents that are activating and ortho/para directors would have higher para fractions.

Substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors, while 2,4,6 are meta directors.

So substituents 2,4,6 have lower para fractions (possibly 0%), while substituents 1,3,5 have higher para fractions.

So the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be substituents 2,4,6, then 1,3,5.

But within substituents 1,3,5, which has the highest para fraction?

Substituent 5 (ethyl) is bulkier, so para fraction is highest.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group, but it's an ortho/para director, so para is major.

Substituent 1 (methyl) is activating, so para is major, but less than substituent 5.

So the order is substituent 5 (highest), then 3, then 1.

So the overall order of increasing para fraction would be:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent 1 < substituent 3 < substituent 5.

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 could be in any order as their para fractions are the same (0%).

So in the options, the correct order would be substituents 2,4,6 followed by 1,3,5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because 1 is after 3, but 1 should be lower than 3.

Option D)3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Option C)4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because 3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

The substituents 2,4,6 all have 0% para.

Among substituents 1,3,5, 5 has the highest para fraction, then 3, then 1.

So the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

But the options don't have this exact arrangement.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 3 is after 1.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 5.

Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para product is major. In ethylbenzene, the para product is even more major because of steric reasons.

So substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 3.

Thus, the order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

But among substituents 2,4,6, which comes first? Perhaps in order of their substituent's deactivating strength.

Substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivating group than 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH?), but I'm not sure about the relative strengths of COOEt and COOH.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength for meta directors is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR.

So substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

If the para fraction is inversely related to the deactivating strength (since stronger deactivating groups lead to lower reactivity, but that might not affect the position of the product), but in this case, since all three are meta directors, their para fractions are 0%, so their order doesn't affect the overall arrangement.

Thus, the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

2,4,6 (all 0%), then 1,3,5.

So substituents 2,4,6 are the lowest, followed by 1,3,5.

Looking at the options:

The correct option would place substituents 2,4,6 first, then 1,3,5 in the correct order.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 3 is after 1.

Wait, substituent 1 has a lower para fraction than 3 and 5.

Hmm. Maybe the correct order is:

substituents 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOEt) < substituent1 (CH3) < substituent3 (Cl) < substituent5 (C2H5).

So the order is 4<6<2<1<3<5.

Looking at option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. No, because substituent3 is after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the correct order. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para.

Substituent1 (CH3) has a lower para fraction than substituent3 (Cl), and substituent5 (C2H5) has the highest.

So the order should be:

2,4,6 (all 0%) < 1 <3 <5.

So the overall order is substituents with 0% (2,4,6) followed by 1,3,5.

But looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 1 comes after 3.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because substituent3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that substituent3's para fraction is higher than substituent1's.

So the order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

In terms of the substituents, this would be:

2,4,6,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, none of them directly match. Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. So 4,6,2 first, then 1,5,3.

But according to our analysis, substituent5 should come after substituent3.

So perhaps this is the correct order:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the order would be substituents 4,6,2 (any order) < 1 <3 <5.

Looking at the options, the only option that has substituent5 last is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. But that's not correct because substituent3 should come before substituent5.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. But that would mean substituent5 comes after substituent3, which is correct, but in the option, substituent5 is before substituent3.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 is in the middle, and substituent5 is last.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is substituent 4< substituent6 < substituent2 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the order is 4,6,2,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ no, because substituent3 is last. So that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. No, because substituent3 should come before substituent5.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently.

The question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

So, the substituent with the lowest para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

So, substituents 4,2,6 have 0% para, so they come first. Then substituent1 has a low para fraction, then substituent3 higher, and substituent5 highest.

Thus, the correct order is substituents 4,2,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the substituents in order are 4,2,6,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, substituents 5 and 3 are out of order.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituents 3 comes before 1.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent1 and substituent5.

Wait, in chlorobenzene, the para product is the major product. In toluene, the para product is the major as well. But ethylbenzene's para product is even more major due to steric hindrance.

So substituent5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, substituent3 (Cl) next, and substituent1 (methyl) the lowest among substituents 1,3,5.

So the order is substituent5 > substituent3 > substituent1.

Thus, the overall order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent3 is last, which is incorrect.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituent3 comes before substituent1.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent5 comes before substituent3, which is correct.

Wait, no, substituent5 (ethyl) should have higher para than substituent3 (Cl), so substituent5 should come after substituent3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is substituent4< substituent6 < substituent2 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

Looking for that in the options, none match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But according to my analysis, substituent5 should be last.

So perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is substituent4< substituent6< substituent2< substituent1< substituent3< substituent5.

Which is not exactly any option, but perhaps the closest option is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, but substituent3 (Cl) should have a higher para fraction than substituent1 (methyl).

So substituent3 should come after substituent1 in the order.

Thus, in the options, the correct order would have substituent3 after substituent1 but before substituent5.

Looking again, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent3 is last, which is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

No, because substituent3 should come after substituent1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming substituent5 has the highest para fraction.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent5 (C2H5).

Wait, because Cl is a strong ortho/para director, even though it's deactivating. So perhaps the para fraction is higher in Cl than in ethyl.

So substituent3 has higher para than substituent5.

So the order would be substituent5 < substituent3.

Wait, but ethyl is more bulky, so para is more favored.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent5 (ethyl).

In that case, substituent3 is higher than substituent5.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent5 < substituent3.

Thus, the order is substituents 2,4,6, then 1, then 5, then 3.

Looking for that in the options, does any option have substituent3 last?

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituent3 comes third.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ Yes! The order is 4,6,2, then 1,5,3.

So substituent3 is last, which would have the highest para fraction.

But earlier analysis suggested substituent3 has a higher para fraction than substituent5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think: substituent3 is Cl, which is a strong ortho/para director. So para product is major.

Substituent5 is ethyl, which is also ortho/para but bulkier, so para is major but perhaps less than substituent3.

So substituent3 has a higher para fraction than substituent5.

Thus, the correct order would be substituents2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent5 < substituent3.

Looking at the options, which option has substituent3 last?

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ Yes.

So the order is substituent4,6,2,1,5,3.

Which in terms of para fractions would be:

4,6,2 (0% para) < 1 (low) <5 (medium) <3 (high).

Wait, but substituent3 has the highest para fraction, so it should be last.

Thus, the correct option is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

So the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we analyze the substituents' electronic effects and directing behavior:

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. The para product is favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, but the para fraction is lower than bulkier substituents.
2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**: Deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).
3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**: Deactivating, ortho/para director. The para product is major due to steric and electronic effects.
4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).
5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. The para product is highly favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.
6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**: Deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).

### Order of Para Fraction:
- Substituents 2, 4, and 6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are negligible (0%).
- Among the ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5):
  - Substituent 1 (methyl) has a lower para fraction due to less steric hindrance compared to ethyl.
  - Substituent 3 (chlorine) has a higher para fraction due to its strong ortho/para-directing effect despite being deactivating.
  - Substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.

Thus, the order of increasing para fraction is:

**Substituents 2, 4, 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**

### Matching with Options:
The correct option that matches this order is **C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine usually acts as an electrophile in these reactions, and where the substitution happens depends on the directing groups already present on the benzene ring.

The question provides six different benzene derivatives, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield after reaction with excess bromine. Wait, because it's an excess, it's probably a multiple substitution, but the question is about the para-isomer of the monobromo derivative. Oh wait, no, wait. The question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, no, wait again. Oh, the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Wait, no, that's not possible for all of them. So maybe each reaction produces one main product, and I need to find the para-isomer fraction in each case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says, "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So for each substance, when reacted with excess Br2, the main substitution is monobromination, and the para isomer is the major product or a minor? Or wait, no, maybe each substance undergoes a substitution where the para product is formed, and we have to arrange them based on how much para product each gives. So for each substituent, their directing effects determine where the Br adds.

So I need to figure out for each substituent (the groups attached to benzene), whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they direct para or ortho/para. Then, the para product's yield would depend on the substituent's directing effect.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethyl ester)
3) Cl
4) NO2
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

So, the substituent will direct the incoming Br to certain positions. Let me go one by one.

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is an activating group, since it's an electron donor. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine reacts, the Br can go ortho, meta, or para. Wait, no, methyl is activating and directs to ortho and para. So for substitution, the major products will be ortho and para. But in some cases, para might be more favored if steric hindrance or other factors are at play.

Wait, but when there's a strong activating group, the para isomer might be more prevalent than the ortho, especially when the substituent is bulky. But methyl is not too bulky. Hmm, but when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the product distribution is a mix, but for a single substituent, the para might not be the majority. Or wait, in monosubstitution, for an activating group like methyl, the para would be a major product, but maybe the ortho is even more so because it's closer? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, but for a single substituent, the para-substituted product would be the major one when the substituent is strongly activating and para is more accessible. Alternatively, perhaps for this question, it's about whether the substituent is meta or para director. Wait, all substituents except meta directors would direct to para, but wait, no, some groups are meta directors.

Wait, let's clarify each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para director. So Br can enter at ortho, meta, or para positions? No, wait, no: for an activating group, the substitution occurs at ortho and para. So when the substituent is ortho/para, the Br adds to either ortho or para, not meta.

Wait, no, wait. For monosubstitution, the substituent directs incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions. For example, activating groups (like -CH3) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups can be either ortho/para (like -NO2, which is a strong deactivating, meta director) or meta (like -COOH, which is deactivating and meta).

Wait, wait a second, I think I have the directing effects mixed up. Let me recall:

- Activating groups (EDGs, electron-donating groups) like -CH3, -OCH3, etc., are ortho/para directors. They make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

- Deactivating groups (EWGs, electron-withdrawing groups) can be meta directors, like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, etc. For example, -NO2 is a strong deactivating group and is meta-directing. Similarly, -COOH is deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but wait: some deactivating groups are para directors. For example, the halogens (-F, -Cl, etc.) are deactivating (due to inductive effect) but are ortho/para directors because of their lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making the ortho and para positions more activated.

So for each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para director.

2) COOEt: this is an ester group. The ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ester group (like OCOEt) is an EWG. So for groups like -COOR (ester), they are meta directors. Because they are deactivating and meta-directing.

3) Cl: this is a halogen. It's deactivating (because of the electronegativity, inductive effect), but it's ortho/para director due to resonance. The lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons into the ring through resonance, activating the ortho and para positions.

4) NO2: nitro group. Strongly deactivating, meta director.

5) C2H5: ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's activating, ortho/para director.

6) COOH: carboxylic acid. Strongly deactivating, meta director.

Okay, so now for each substituent, I can tell where the incoming Br will go.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, when Br adds, what's the major positionâ€”para, ortho, or meta?

Wait, but the question says, after the reaction, they form only one monobromo derivative. Wait, that can't be right because in most cases, you'll get more than one isomer. But the question states that only one is formed. Hmm, maybe that's a misunderstanding on my part. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says, "it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps each substituent directs the Br to one position, so all the product is one isomer. So for each substituent, the para-isomer's weight fraction is either 100% or something else, but the assumption is that only one product is formed. Hmm, but that's a bit confusing because, in reality, some substituents lead to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that each reaction gives a single major product, which could be para or another position. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, I need to determine whether the para product is the major or minor, or even if it's the only product.

Wait, but how? Let's think again.

Each substituent directs the bromine to certain positions, and the relative amounts depend on the directing.

For example, if the substituent is a strong ortho/para director, then the para product would be a major isomer. But sometimes, the ortho product might be more favored due to steric factors. For example, when the substituent is a bulky group like a tert-butyl, the para product is favored because the ortho positions are crowded.

So, for each substituent, I need to consider their directing effects and steric hindrance to determine the major product.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): methyl is a small substituent. It's an activating, ortho/para director. The incoming Br can go to ortho, para. But which is more favored? For a methyl group, I think the para position is more favored because the ortho positions are adjacent and perhaps there's less steric hindrance compared to a bulkier group, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, for a small substituent like methyl, the ortho positions are actually closer, so perhaps they are more reactive? Or maybe the para is more favored. I think, in general, for monosubstituted benzene with activating groups, the para product is the major one. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, when a substituent is an activating, ortho/para director, the Br tends to add to the para position more than the ortho, especially in the case of a single substituent. Because, in the para position, there's less steric hindrance compared to ortho. Alternatively, for small substituents, the ortho might be more reactive. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's activating nature leads to higher reactivity at ortho and para, but the para might be more favored due to being more accessible when there's no steric hindrance. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think that for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the major product is typically the para-isomer when the substituent is not too bulky. For instance, in toluene (methyl benzene), the para-bromination is the major product because the methyl group is small, so the para position is more accessible than the ortho, which would be next to the methyl.

Wait, but I've read before that the major product in toluene bromination is the para isomer. So perhaps for substituent 1, the para isomer is major.

But wait, no, wait. Another source says that the major product for toluene bromination is the ortho and para, but the majority is para because it's more favored when the substituent directs but the position is more accessible. Alternatively, maybe it's a 50:50, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take each substituent and figure out the para product's fraction.

Let me make a table:

Substituent | Type (activating/deactivating) | Director (ortho/para/meta) | Para product yield
--- | --- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | activating | ortho/para | high (major)
2) COOEt | deactivating | meta | no para (so 0% para)
3) Cl | deactivating | ortho/para | major (para)
4) NO2 | deactivating | meta | no para (so 0% para)
5) C2H5 | activating | ortho/para | high (para)
6) COOH | deactivating | meta | no para (0%)

Wait, but that can't be right because substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para products would be minimal. So for substituents 2,4,6, the para product isn't formed, so the weight fraction is 0%? But that's probably not correct because in meta directors, the substituent directs to meta, so the para would be minor, but is there any para product?

Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully. For a meta-directing group, the incoming electrophile goes to the meta position relative to the substituent. So in that case, the product would be meta, and the para product would be a minor isomer or perhaps not formed at all. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the terminology.

Wait, wait. Let's take substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). It's a meta director. So when Br adds, it would add to the meta position relative to the ester group. So the product would be meta-bromo with respect to COOEt. So the para position relative to the ester group would not be a major product. Therefore, the para product isn't formed in this case. So the weight fraction of the para-isomer would be 0%.

Same for substituent 4, NO2: meta director. So Br adds meta to NO2. So no para product.

Substituent 6: COOH is a meta director, so Br adds meta to COOH. So no para product.

So for substituents 2,4,6, the para product's yield isn't formed, so their weight fraction is 0%.

Wait, but that can't be the case because in the options, all substituents are ordered with some fractions. Alternatively, perhaps para product is present but in negligible amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents can lead to a little para product, but it's minor. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, so if a substituent leads to mostly meta product, the para would contribute a small fraction.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents can lead to some para product, but the major is elsewhere. So for substituent 2, the major product is meta, but there would be minor para and ortho products.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, I need to figure out how much para product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps if the substituent is a meta director, the para product isn't formed, so the weight fraction is 0%.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me go back to each substituent:

1) CH3: ortho/para director. So when Br adds, it can go ortho or para. The major product is para because it's less hindered. So for substituent 1, the para product is a major fraction.

2) COOEt: meta director. Br adds meta to COOEt. So para product isn't formed, so 0% para.

3) Cl: ortho/para director. So Br can add ortho or para. Which is more major? Cl is a strong ortho/para director, but for para, perhaps the major product is para. Like in chlorobenzene, the major product upon bromination is para-bromochlorobenzene. So substituent 3 would have high para fraction.

4) NO2: meta director. Br adds meta, so no para. So 0% para.

5) C2H5: ortho/para director. So Br adds to ortho or para. For a larger substituent like ethyl, perhaps the para product is favored because ortho is more hindered. So substituent 5's para product is major.

6) COOH: meta director. Br adds meta, so 0% para.

Wait, so substituents 2,4,6 would have 0% para, substituents 1,3,5 would have higher para fractions.

Now, among substituents 1,3,5, which has the highest, medium, and lowest para fractions.

Substituent 1: methyl. Activating, ortho/para. Para is major.

Substituent 3: Cl. Deactivating, ortho/para. So when Br adds, it's more likely to be para than ortho because Cl is a strong deactivating group, but it's an ortho/para director. Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, but it's a weak deactivating (due to resonance). So it's activating in comparison to NO2, but how does that affect the product distribution?

Wait, when the substituent is an activating group, the ring is more reactive, but in the case of deactivating groups like Cl, the ring is less reactive, but the incoming Br still adds ortho and para.

Wait, but for substituent 3, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So for the bromination reaction, which is an electrophilic substitution, the Cl group makes the ring less reactive than benzene but directs Br to ortho and para positions.

In such a case, which position is more favored? For Cl, the para product is typically the major isomer. For example, in chlorobenzene, bromination gives mainly para-brom chlorobenzene as the major product.

Substituent 5: ethyl group. It's an activating, ortho/para director. So when Br adds, the major product would be para, because the ethyl group is larger than methyl, so the ortho positions are more hindered, making para the major product.

So substituent 5's para product is major, perhaps more than substituent 1 (methyl) because of steric factors.

So putting it together, the order from lowest to highest para product fraction would be:

Substituents with 0% para: 2,4,6.

Then in substituents with higher para, we have 1,3,5.

But wait, substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1's.

Wait, substituent 1: methyl, which is small. So Br tends to add to ortho and para. But para is more favored because less steric hindrance. So the para product is major in this case.

Substituent 5: ethyl is larger, so para is more favored, so higher para fraction than methyl.

Substituent 3: Cl is deactivating. So para product is major, but due to deactivation, the overall reactivity is lower, but the directing effect still leads to para being major.

So among substituents 1,3,5:

Substituent 5 (ethyl) would have the highest para fraction, substituent 3 (Cl) next, and substituent 1 (methyl) the lowest. Wait, but earlier I thought substituent 1 would have a higher para fraction. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, in the case of substituent 3 (Cl), the para product is the major product due to Cl being an ortho/para director. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than substituent 1's.

Wait, but substituent 1 is activating, so the ring is more reactive, but the para fraction could be similar to substituent 3's, but perhaps in substituent 3's case, the para fraction is higher because the substituent is deactivating but still directs to para.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the actual product distributions.

For benzyl derivatives:

- Toluene (methyl benzene): Bromination gives para-bromotoluene as the major product, with some ortho and a little meta (though meta is less likely, since methyl is activating).

Wait, but actually, for toluene, the major product is para, but sometimes ortho is a significant isomer because methyl is small. But in practice, the para product is more favored due to less steric hindrance. So substituent 1 has a high para fraction.

Chlorobenzene: Bromination gives mainly para-bromo chlorobenzene as the major product, with some ortho. So substituent 3 has a high para fraction.

Ethylbenzene: Bromination would have a major para product, perhaps more than toluene because ethyl is bulkier, making ortho less favored.

So substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But substituent 3 (Cl) may have a para fraction similar to or higher than substituent 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of activating vs deactivating.

Substituent 1: Activating, so ring is more reactive. Ortho/para director. So more para product.

Substituent 3: Deactivating (but ortho/para director). So the ring is less reactive, but still, the para product is major.

Substituent 5: Activating (like 1), but ethyl is bulkier. So para is major.

So in terms of para fraction from highest to lowest:

1) substituent 5 (highest, because ethyl is bulky, so para is major)
2) substituent 3 (Cl) (moderate, but deactivating, so perhaps para is major)
3) substituent 1 (methyl) (less than 5, because less steric hindrance)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, substituent 3 (Cl) might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 because of the directing effect, even though Cl is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the order of para product fractions is:

Substituent 5 > substituent 3 > substituent 1.

Because substituent 5 is bulky, leading to more para. Substituent 3 is deactivating but still an ortho/para director, so para is major. Substituent 1 is activating but not as bulky, so para is major but perhaps less than substituent 5.

So, the substituents with the lowest para fraction are substituent 2,4,6 (0% each?), but wait, we can't have all three at 0%. So perhaps substituent 2,4,6 have lower para fractions than 1, but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). It's a meta director. So when Br adds, it adds meta to the ester group. So in this case, the para product would have Br in a position that's para to where? Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the terms.

Wait, when the substituent is a meta director, the incoming electrophile adds to the meta position relative to the substituent. So in the case of substituent 2, the Br would be meta to the ester group, but that would be the same as para to another substituent? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2's meta product is the major product, so the para product isn't formed, making the para fraction 0%.

Same for substituent 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH), so substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para fraction.

Substituents 1,3,5 have varying para fractions:

- substituent 1: methyl; para product is major, but perhaps not 100%.
- substituent 3: Cl; para product is major.
- substituent 5: ethyl; para product is major, perhaps more than substituent 3.

So, the para fractions are in the order: substituent 5 > substituent 3 > substituent 1.

But for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is 0%.

So if I'm to arrange all six substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

The order would be substituents with 0% para first, then the others.

Which substituents have 0% para? 2,4,6.

Then substituents 1,3,5.

So the sequence would be 2,4,6 (all 0%), followed by 1, 3,5.

Wait, but how do substituents 2,4,6 compare among themselves? Wait, all of them have 0% para, so their para fractions are the same. But perhaps in reality, some may have a very small amount, but the question says to assume only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

substituents 2,4,6 (0% para), then substituents 1,3,5.

But in the options, the order includes all six substituents. So looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but substituents 4,2,6 all have 0% para. So within these three, their order doesn't matter for the overall arrangement. But perhaps substituents with stronger deactivating groups or better directors could have some effect.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger meta director than 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH). So perhaps substituent 4 would have the lowest para fraction (since it's a stronger deactivating group, but already meta director, so para fraction is 0%).

Wait, but all three substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are 0%, but their actual position in the order would depend on their overall effect.

Hmm, perhaps the answer expects that substituents with stronger deactivating groups (like NO2) would have lower reactivity, but that doesn't affect the position of the para product, which is 0% for all three.

So the order would be substituents 4,2,6 (each 0%), then substituents 1,3,5 in increasing order of their para fractions (1 <3 <5).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 4,2,6 are all 0%, so they should be before 3 and 1.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No, same issue.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, same issue.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No, because substituents 6,2,4 should be early in the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is substituents 4,2,6 (0%), followed by substituent 1, then 3, then 5.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, substituent 3 (Cl) next, and substituent 1 (methyl) the lowest.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction:

Substituents 4,2,6 (0% each), then 1,3,5.

So the order would be 4=2=6 < 1 <3 <5.

But in the options, the substituents 4,2,6 are all placed before 3,1,5.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because 1 should come after 3.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because 3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para is incorrect. Maybe they do have some para product, but it's negligible, so the para fraction is very low but not zero.

In that case, substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 2,4,6.

So, the order would be substituents 2,4,6 (lowest para), then 1, then 3, then 5.

So the order from lowest to highest para:

2<4<6<1<3<5.

But looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has the lowest para fraction among the activating groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to list the substituents in order of their activating/deactivating and directing effects.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the substituent that directs to para the most would have the highest para fraction.

So the substituents that are activating and ortho/para directors would have higher para fractions.

Substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors, while 2,4,6 are meta directors.

So substituents 2,4,6 have lower para fractions (possibly 0%), while substituents 1,3,5 have higher para fractions.

So the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be substituents 2,4,6, then 1,3,5.

But within substituents 1,3,5, which has the highest para fraction?

Substituent 5 (ethyl) is bulkier, so para fraction is highest.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group, but it's an ortho/para director, so para is major.

Substituent 1 (methyl) is activating, so para is major, but less than substituent 5.

So the order is substituent 5 (highest), then 3, then 1.

So the overall order of increasing para fraction would be:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent 1 < substituent 3 < substituent 5.

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 could be in any order as their para fractions are the same (0%).

So in the options, the correct order would be substituents 2,4,6 followed by 1,3,5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because 1 is after 3, but 1 should be lower than 3.

Option D)3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Option C)4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because 3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think again.

The substituents 2,4,6 all have 0% para.

Among substituents 1,3,5, 5 has the highest para fraction, then 3, then 1.

So the overall order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

But the options don't have this exact arrangement.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 3 is after 1.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 5.

Wait, in chlorobenzene bromination, the para product is major. In ethylbenzene, the para product is even more major because of steric reasons.

So substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 3.

Thus, the order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

But among substituents 2,4,6, which comes first? Perhaps in order of their substituent's deactivating strength.

Substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivating group than 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH?), but I'm not sure about the relative strengths of COOEt and COOH.

Wait, the order of deactivating strength for meta directors is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR.

So substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivating, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

If the para fraction is inversely related to the deactivating strength (since stronger deactivating groups lead to lower reactivity, but that might not affect the position of the product), but in this case, since all three are meta directors, their para fractions are 0%, so their order doesn't affect the overall arrangement.

Thus, the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

2,4,6 (all 0%), then 1,3,5.

So substituents 2,4,6 are the lowest, followed by 1,3,5.

Looking at the options:

The correct option would place substituents 2,4,6 first, then 1,3,5 in the correct order.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 3 is after 1.

Wait, substituent 1 has a lower para fraction than 3 and 5.

Hmm. Maybe the correct order is:

substituents 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), 2 (COOEt) < substituent1 (CH3) < substituent3 (Cl) < substituent5 (C2H5).

So the order is 4<6<2<1<3<5.

Looking at option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. No, because substituent3 is after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the correct order. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para.

Substituent1 (CH3) has a lower para fraction than substituent3 (Cl), and substituent5 (C2H5) has the highest.

So the order should be:

2,4,6 (all 0%) < 1 <3 <5.

So the overall order is substituents with 0% (2,4,6) followed by 1,3,5.

But looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, because substituents 1 comes after 3.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because substituent3 should come after 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that substituent3's para fraction is higher than substituent1's.

So the order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

In terms of the substituents, this would be:

2,4,6,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, none of them directly match. Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. So 4,6,2 first, then 1,5,3.

But according to our analysis, substituent5 should come after substituent3.

So perhaps this is the correct order:

substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the order would be substituents 4,6,2 (any order) < 1 <3 <5.

Looking at the options, the only option that has substituent5 last is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. But that's not correct because substituent3 should come before substituent5.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. But that would mean substituent5 comes after substituent3, which is correct, but in the option, substituent5 is before substituent3.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 is in the middle, and substituent5 is last.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is substituent 4< substituent6 < substituent2 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the order is 4,6,2,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ no, because substituent3 is last. So that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3. No, because substituent3 should come before substituent5.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently.

The question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

So, the substituent with the lowest para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

So, substituents 4,2,6 have 0% para, so they come first. Then substituent1 has a low para fraction, then substituent3 higher, and substituent5 highest.

Thus, the correct order is substituents 4,2,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

So the substituents in order are 4,2,6,1,3,5.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, substituents 5 and 3 are out of order.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituents 3 comes before 1.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent1 and substituent5.

Wait, in chlorobenzene, the para product is the major product. In toluene, the para product is the major as well. But ethylbenzene's para product is even more major due to steric hindrance.

So substituent5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, substituent3 (Cl) next, and substituent1 (methyl) the lowest among substituents 1,3,5.

So the order is substituent5 > substituent3 > substituent1.

Thus, the overall order is substituents 2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent3 is last, which is incorrect.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituent3 comes before substituent1.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent5 comes before substituent3, which is correct.

Wait, no, substituent5 (ethyl) should have higher para than substituent3 (Cl), so substituent5 should come after substituent3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is substituent4< substituent6 < substituent2 < substituent1 < substituent3 < substituent5.

Looking for that in the options, none match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But according to my analysis, substituent5 should be last.

So perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is substituent4< substituent6< substituent2< substituent1< substituent3< substituent5.

Which is not exactly any option, but perhaps the closest option is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, but substituent3 (Cl) should have a higher para fraction than substituent1 (methyl).

So substituent3 should come after substituent1 in the order.

Thus, in the options, the correct order would have substituent3 after substituent1 but before substituent5.

Looking again, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ substituent3 is last, which is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

No, because substituent3 should come after substituent1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming substituent5 has the highest para fraction.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent5 (C2H5).

Wait, because Cl is a strong ortho/para director, even though it's deactivating. So perhaps the para fraction is higher in Cl than in ethyl.

So substituent3 has higher para than substituent5.

So the order would be substituent5 < substituent3.

Wait, but ethyl is more bulky, so para is more favored.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituent5 (ethyl).

In that case, substituent3 is higher than substituent5.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent5 < substituent3.

Thus, the order is substituents 2,4,6, then 1, then 5, then 3.

Looking for that in the options, does any option have substituent3 last?

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ No, substituent3 comes third.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ Yes! The order is 4,6,2, then 1,5,3.

So substituent3 is last, which would have the highest para fraction.

But earlier analysis suggested substituent3 has a higher para fraction than substituent5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think: substituent3 is Cl, which is a strong ortho/para director. So para product is major.

Substituent5 is ethyl, which is also ortho/para but bulkier, so para is major but perhaps less than substituent3.

So substituent3 has a higher para fraction than substituent5.

Thus, the correct order would be substituents2,4,6 < substituent1 < substituent5 < substituent3.

Looking at the options, which option has substituent3 last?

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ Yes.

So the order is substituent4,6,2,1,5,3.

Which in terms of para fractions would be:

4,6,2 (0% para) < 1 (low) <5 (medium) <3 (high).

Wait, but substituent3 has the highest para fraction, so it should be last.

Thus, the correct option is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

So the answer is option C.


To determine the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we analyze the substituents' electronic effects and directing behavior:

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. The para product is favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions, but the para fraction is lower than bulkier substituents.
2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**: Deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).
3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**: Deactivating, ortho/para director. The para product is major due to steric and electronic effects.
4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).
5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. The para product is highly favored due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.
6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**: Deactivating, meta director. The para product is negligible (0%).

### Order of Para Fraction:
- Substituents 2, 4, and 6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are negligible (0%).
- Among the ortho/para directors (1, 3, 5):
  - Substituent 1 (methyl) has a lower para fraction due to less steric hindrance compared to ethyl.
  - Substituent 3 (chlorine) has a higher para fraction due to its strong ortho/para-directing effect despite being deactivating.
  - Substituent 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.

Thus, the order of increasing para fraction is:

**Substituents 2, 4, 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**

### Matching with Options:
The correct option that matches this order is **C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.
