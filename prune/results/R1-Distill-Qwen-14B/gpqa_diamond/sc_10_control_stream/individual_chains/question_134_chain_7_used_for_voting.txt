Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The problem gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction.

Wait, the options are in different units, some in kcal and others in kJ. Oh right, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules, so I'll need to make sure I convert units correctly.

First, I think I need to figure out how much each acid and base contributes. The reaction will involve neutralization, but since there are multiple acids and a strong base, I'll have to find the limiting reactants.

Let's list out the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. So moles of HCl would be 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll dissociate completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So the OH- is 0.2 mol. How much H+ is available? 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reactant here because it's less than H+.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water and neutralization.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is diprotic. So when it reacts with a base, it can donate both H+ ions. But if the base is in limited supply, maybe only some of the H+ is neutralized.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and total OH- and see which is in excess.

Total H+:
HCl: 0.1 mol
H2SO4: each gives 2 H+. 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4. So H+ is 0.18 mol.
Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH-:
Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is consumed, using 0.2 moles of H+.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with a ΔH of about -55.8 kJ/mol. Or wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.0 kJ/mol, but I might have to double-check. Oh wait, sometimes it's given as approximately -55.8 kJ/mol per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔHn) is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 55.8 kJ (but negative because it's exothermic).

So in this case, since 0.2 moles of OH- are reacting, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-55.8 kJ/mol) = -11.16 kJ. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and contributes two H+ per molecule, but not both are used if OH- is the limiting factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H+ will react. The available H+ is 0.28, so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+ remains unreacted.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid and will completely ionize. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well but in aqueous solution, the first dissociation is complete, the second is about 90% but for simplicity, perhaps we can assume it's completely dissociated. So the initial H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18. So all of that will be available.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the amount of H+ and OH- available.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, moles reacting: 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-55.8 kJ) = -11.16 kJ. So that's approximately -11.2 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but the units here are in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, wait a second. Oh no, perhaps I made a mistake with the units. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is sometimes given per mole as -57.0 kJ/mol, but perhaps in some contexts it's given in different units. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, the options are a mix of kcal and kJ. Oh, option A and B are in kcal, while C and D are in kJ.

Wait, I think I remember that 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is calculated as -11.16 kJ, that's about -2.67 kcal (since 11.16 /4.184 ≈ 2.67). But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it in kcal. If the ΔH is -55.8 kcal per mole, wait, no, because 55.8 kJ is equivalent to about 13.4 kcal (since 55.8 / 4.184 ≈ 13.33 kcal). Wait, that can't be right because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, wait. No, wait: 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So if the total enthalpy is -11.16 kJ, converting to kcal: 11.16 * 0.239 ≈ 2.66 kcal. So approximately -2.66 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. But wait, why is the option B -11.42 kcal? Oh, if someone made a mistake in units and thought it's kJ but actually it's kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the enthalpy using kcal directly. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -55.8 kJ/mol, which is -55.8 /4.184 ≈ -13.33 kcal/mol.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 kJ is 239.006 cal (since 1 kJ = 1000 J, 1 cal =4.184 J → 1000/4.184 ≈ 239.006 cal). So 55.8 kJ is 55,800 J. To calories: 55,800 /4.184 ≈ 13,333 cal → 13.33 kcal.

So the standard ΔH is -13.33 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually reported as approximately -57.0 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), which converts to about -13.6 kcal/mol.

But perhaps in the context of this problem, they use a different value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value. Let me think: the given problem might be using 1 cal = 4.18 J, so 1 kJ is 239.14 cal.

So, how to proceed. Let's compute the ΔH in kJ and kcal.

We have 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Each mole releases 55.8 kJ. So 0.2 * 55.8 = 11.16 kJ. So ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the specific heat capacities and the heat released into the solution, but I don't think so. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat change from the reaction, not the heat transfer to the solution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Let me double-check.

H+ available: 0.28 mol.

OH- available: 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So only 0.2 mol of H+ is consumed. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ is unreacted.

So the total neutralization is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (ΔH per mole).

So if ΔH is -55.8 kJ/mol, it's -11.16 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.2 kJ. But none of the kJ options match that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: calculate the amount of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles needed for neutralization: 0.2 mol OH- requires 0.2 mol H+.

So, H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol.

So the total heat released is 0.2 * ΔH per mole.

But perhaps the problem expects me to consider that H2SO4 is diprotic and that each H+ contributes to the neutralization. Wait, but in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so the total neutralization is 0.2 mol.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol. So the heat is 0.2 * (-55.8) kJ = -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, there's no option like that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 *0.2 =0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3 =0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+. So 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So the total neutralization is 0.2 mol. So ΔH is -11.16 kJ. But looking at the options, the only kJ option is D) -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total amount of H+ and OH- from all solutions and then find the excess.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ and OH-; maybe it's considering the combination of acids and base in a single reaction.

Wait, mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, the H+ from both acids will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it'll provide OH-.

So, the OH- is 0.2 mol, which will neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

But wait, perhaps the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So, in total 0.28 mol H+.

So, 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ will not react.

So, the heat released is 0.2 * 55.8 kJ → 11.16 kJ. So, ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

But none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal → approx -11.6 kJ (since 2.72 kcal *4.184≈ 11.42 kJ)
B) -11.42 kcal → about -47.8 kJ
C) -3.80 kcal → about -16.0 kJ
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option C and D are similar. Option C is -3.8 kcal, which is about -16.0 kJ (3.8 *4.184≈ 16.0 kJ).

But I'm getting -11.16 kJ, which is around -2.67 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But wait, the standard enthalpy per mole is -55.8 kJ, which is -13.3 kcal. Wait, no, wait: 55.8 kJ is 55,800 J. 55,800 /4184 ≈ 13.33 kcal.

So per mole, ΔH is -13.33 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-13.33) = -2.666 kcal → approx -2.67 kcal.

So the closest option is A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Oh, because if someone calculates using the kJ value and then converts, perhaps.

Wait, 11.16 kJ is 11,160 J. Divided by 4184 J/kcal equals approximately 2.666 kcal. So about -2.67 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about -49.1 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.8 kJ). No, because 11.42 kcal is about 48.16 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -57 kJ/mol.

0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ. So if the options had that in kJ, it would be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. The closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Let me think about that.

Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

Wait, but the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 and 0.1 respectively. So H2SO4 is in lesser quantity (0.09 < 0.1). So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here.

Ah, so perhaps I should approach this differently. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a neutralization reaction where H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Let me calculate the moles:

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2:0.2 L *0.5 M=0.1 mol.

The balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 can react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so any remaining will react with the HCl.

Wait, but I need to consider all possible reactions. First, the H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate and water. Then, any excess Ba(OH)2 will react with HCl?

Wait, no, because after the reaction, the excess is Ba(OH)2, but it's a strong base, so perhaps it will provide OH- which will react with H+ from HCl.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

First, reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) + Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) → BaSO4 (0.09 mol) + 2 H2O.

So, after this reaction, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol left.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 mol) will dissociate into 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl (0.1 mol H+) will react with this OH-.

So H+ (0.1) + OH- (0.02) → 0.02 mol H2O. So H+ left: 0.08.

So the total neutralization would be from the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction (producing 2 H2O per mole) and the remaining Ba(OH)2 reacting with HCl.

Wait, but perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different than that for HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, but the enthalpy of neutralization is typically considered per mole of H+ and OH- reacting, regardless of the acid or base.

Wait, but in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes two moles of OH-? Or wait, no, the reaction is 1 H2SO4 + 1 Ba(OH)2 → 1 BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 2 H+ and 2 OH-, producing 2 H2O.

So the enthalpy change for this reaction would be 2 * (55.8 kJ) → 111.6 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -111.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+.

So for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

The reaction: 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So 2 moles of H+ and 2 moles of OH- react, releasing 2 *55.8 =111.6 kJ.

So for the 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacting, it provides 0.18 mol H+.

And 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

So all of the H+ and OH- from these (0.18 each) will react, releasing 0.18 *55.8 =10.044 kJ.

Wait, but that approach seems conflicting with the previous.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the better approach is to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- from all sources and see how much reacts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- available and find the minimum.

Total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 *2 =0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ =0.28.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 *2 =0.2 mol.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol H+ will react, releasing 0.2 *55.8 =11.16 kJ.

So the total ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, this would be approximately -11.2 kJ. But none of the options match except if option B is in kJ. But option B is in kcal.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the only option that's in the same ballpark is option D at -16 kJ, but that's larger than our calculated -11.16 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and that the second H+ may not dissociate completely. But I think for the purposes of this problem, we can assume complete dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 produces two moles of water per mole of acid, and each mole of water formation releases 55.8 kJ. So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, 0.18 mol H+ would react with 0.18 mol OH-.

But wait, the OH- available is 0.2 mol. So if 0.18 mol OH- is used in the reaction with H2SO4, then the remaining 0.02 mol OH- will react with HCl.

So let's break it into two steps:

1. Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 mol), producing BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

This would release 0.18 *55.8 = 10.044 kJ.

2. Remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol. It provides 0.02 mol OH-.

This reacts with HCl: 0.02 mol H+ from HCl reacts, releasing 0.02 *55.8 =1.116 kJ.

3. Remaining HCl: 0.1 -0.02 =0.08 mol H+.

So total heat released is 10.044 +1.116 =11.16 kJ → -11.16 kJ.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, the options list option B as -11.42 kcal. Let me compute that in kJ: 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈47.85 kJ. So that's about 47.85 kJ. Which is much larger than our 11.16 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is in terms of the total possible neutralization, not considering the excess.

Wait, suppose all the H+ and OH- are neutralized.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So if they all reacted, 0.2 mol H+ would react, and 0.08 remains. But that's the same as before.

Hmm. I think I've reached the conclusion that the correct answer is approximately -11.2 kJ, but since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole. Let me recalculate.

Total H+ =0.28.

Total OH- =0.2.

So the limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 mol). So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react.

Each mole releases 55.8 kJ, so 0.2 *55.8 =11.16 kJ.

So ΔH = -11.16 kJ.

But none of the options match, except if option B is -11.42 kJ, but it's listed as kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ΔH, like -57 kJ/mol.

0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which would be approximately -11.4 kJ. But again, none of the options match except if option B is converted.

Wait, if the enthalpy is calculated as 0.2 * (-55.8) kJ, that's 11.16 kJ, but perhaps the problem uses -57 kJ/mol, making it 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ.

So the total ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is often given as about -28.0 kJ/mol. But that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and use the standard enthalpy.

So the correct ΔH is -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the closest.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about -3.82 kcal. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mixing of all three solutions, but I'm not considering that some reactions may produce more or less heat.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH-, find the minimum, and then multiply by the enthalpy.

But I've done that and it's 0.2 mol.

So why is the option D there?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, it produces two moles of water per mole of H2SO4.

So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, it produces 0.18 mol H2O. Each mole of H2O formation releases 55.8 kJ. So 0.18 *55.8 =10.044 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 mol) reacts with HCl. 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 →0.02 mol OH-.

Which reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 *55.8 =1.116 kJ.

Total ΔH:10.044 +1.116=11.16 kJ.

Same as before.

So the answer should be about -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal.

But the options give -2.72 kcal (option A).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ΔH, such as -57.3 kJ/mol.

0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

Which is -11.46 kJ.

If the problem uses this value, then the total would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.75 kcal.

Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

So I think the intended answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each molecule of H₂SO₄ provides 2 H⁺ ions, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each molecule of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reactant
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
- Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reactant (0.2 mol < 0.28 mol), all 0.2 mol of OH⁻ will react, consuming 0.2 mol of H⁺.

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( \Delta H = -55.8 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻.  
For 0.2 mol of OH⁻ reacting:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-55.8 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.16 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
To convert \( -11.16 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
\[
-11.16 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.67 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The problem gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I need to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction.

Wait, the options are in different units, some in kcal and others in kJ. Oh right, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules, so I'll need to make sure I convert units correctly.

First, I think I need to figure out how much each acid and base contributes. The reaction will involve neutralization, but since there are multiple acids and a strong base, I'll have to find the limiting reactants.

Let's list out the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. So moles of HCl would be 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll dissociate completely, so 0.1 moles of H+.

- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol. The OH- is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So the OH- is 0.2 mol. How much H+ is available? 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reactant here because it's less than H+.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water and neutralization.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is diprotic. So when it reacts with a base, it can donate both H+ ions. But if the base is in limited supply, maybe only some of the H+ is neutralized.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total H+ and total OH- and see which is in excess.

Total H+:
HCl: 0.1 mol
H2SO4: each gives 2 H+. 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4. So H+ is 0.18 mol.
Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH-:
Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28.

So the reaction will proceed until all OH- is consumed, using 0.2 moles of H+.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with a ΔH of about -55.8 kJ/mol. Or wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.0 kJ/mol, but I might have to double-check. Oh wait, sometimes it's given as approximately -55.8 kJ/mol per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔHn) is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 55.8 kJ (but negative because it's exothermic).

So in this case, since 0.2 moles of OH- are reacting, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-55.8 kJ/mol) = -11.16 kJ. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and contributes two H+ per molecule, but not both are used if OH- is the limiting factor. Let me think again.

Wait, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 mol of H+ will react. The available H+ is 0.28, so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+ remains unreacted.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid and will completely ionize. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well but in aqueous solution, the first dissociation is complete, the second is about 90% but for simplicity, perhaps we can assume it's completely dissociated. So the initial H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18. So all of that will be available.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the amount of H+ and OH- available.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, moles reacting: 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-55.8 kJ) = -11.16 kJ. So that's approximately -11.2 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but the units here are in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, wait a second. Oh no, perhaps I made a mistake with the units. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is sometimes given per mole as -57.0 kJ/mol, but perhaps in some contexts it's given in different units. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, the options are a mix of kcal and kJ. Oh, option A and B are in kcal, while C and D are in kJ.

Wait, I think I remember that 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So if the enthalpy is calculated as -11.16 kJ, that's about -2.67 kcal (since 11.16 /4.184 ≈ 2.67). But looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it in kcal. If the ΔH is -55.8 kcal per mole, wait, no, because 55.8 kJ is equivalent to about 13.4 kcal (since 55.8 / 4.184 ≈ 13.33 kcal). Wait, that can't be right because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, wait. No, wait: 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ → 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal).

So if the total enthalpy is -11.16 kJ, converting to kcal: 11.16 * 0.239 ≈ 2.66 kcal. So approximately -2.66 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. But wait, why is the option B -11.42 kcal? Oh, if someone made a mistake in units and thought it's kJ but actually it's kcal.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the enthalpy using kcal directly. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -55.8 kJ/mol, which is -55.8 /4.184 ≈ -13.33 kcal/mol.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 kJ is 239.006 cal (since 1 kJ = 1000 J, 1 cal =4.184 J → 1000/4.184 ≈ 239.006 cal). So 55.8 kJ is 55,800 J. To calories: 55,800 /4.184 ≈ 13,333 cal → 13.33 kcal.

So the standard ΔH is -13.33 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually reported as approximately -57.0 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), which converts to about -13.6 kcal/mol.

But perhaps in the context of this problem, they use a different value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value. Let me think: the given problem might be using 1 cal = 4.18 J, so 1 kJ is 239.14 cal.

So, how to proceed. Let's compute the ΔH in kJ and kcal.

We have 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Each mole releases 55.8 kJ. So 0.2 * 55.8 = 11.16 kJ. So ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the specific heat capacities and the heat released into the solution, but I don't think so. The question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat change from the reaction, not the heat transfer to the solution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the limiting reagent. Let me double-check.

H+ available: 0.28 mol.

OH- available: 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So only 0.2 mol of H+ is consumed. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ is unreacted.

So the total neutralization is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (ΔH per mole).

So if ΔH is -55.8 kJ/mol, it's -11.16 kJ.

Which is approximately -11.2 kJ. But none of the kJ options match that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: calculate the amount of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 mol/L =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 mol/L=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles needed for neutralization: 0.2 mol OH- requires 0.2 mol H+.

So, H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol.

So the total heat released is 0.2 * ΔH per mole.

But perhaps the problem expects me to consider that H2SO4 is diprotic and that each H+ contributes to the neutralization. Wait, but in this case, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so the total neutralization is 0.2 mol.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the minimum.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH-: 0.2.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol. So the heat is 0.2 * (-55.8) kJ = -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, there's no option like that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 *0.2 =0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3 =0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+. So 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So the total neutralization is 0.2 mol. So ΔH is -11.16 kJ. But looking at the options, the only kJ option is D) -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total amount of H+ and OH- from all solutions and then find the excess.

Wait, another thing: perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ and OH-; maybe it's considering the combination of acids and base in a single reaction.

Wait, mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, the H+ from both acids will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it'll provide OH-.

So, the OH- is 0.2 mol, which will neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

But wait, perhaps the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So, in total 0.28 mol H+.

So, 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ will not react.

So, the heat released is 0.2 * 55.8 kJ → 11.16 kJ. So, ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

But none of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal → approx -11.6 kJ (since 2.72 kcal *4.184≈ 11.42 kJ)
B) -11.42 kcal → about -47.8 kJ
C) -3.80 kcal → about -16.0 kJ
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option C and D are similar. Option C is -3.8 kcal, which is about -16.0 kJ (3.8 *4.184≈ 16.0 kJ).

But I'm getting -11.16 kJ, which is around -2.67 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But wait, the standard enthalpy per mole is -55.8 kJ, which is -13.3 kcal. Wait, no, wait: 55.8 kJ is 55,800 J. 55,800 /4184 ≈ 13.33 kcal.

So per mole, ΔH is -13.33 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-13.33) = -2.666 kcal → approx -2.67 kcal.

So the closest option is A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? Oh, because if someone calculates using the kJ value and then converts, perhaps.

Wait, 11.16 kJ is 11,160 J. Divided by 4184 J/kcal equals approximately 2.666 kcal. So about -2.67 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about -49.1 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.8 kJ). No, because 11.42 kcal is about 48.16 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value, like -57 kJ/mol.

0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is -11.4 kJ. So if the options had that in kJ, it would be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. The closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the reaction stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might produce BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Let me think about that.

Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

Wait, but the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 and 0.1 respectively. So H2SO4 is in lesser quantity (0.09 < 0.1). So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here.

Ah, so perhaps I should approach this differently. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is a neutralization reaction where H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Let me calculate the moles:

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2:0.2 L *0.5 M=0.1 mol.

The balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 can react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so any remaining will react with the HCl.

Wait, but I need to consider all possible reactions. First, the H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate and water. Then, any excess Ba(OH)2 will react with HCl?

Wait, no, because after the reaction, the excess is Ba(OH)2, but it's a strong base, so perhaps it will provide OH- which will react with H+ from HCl.

Wait, let's break it down step by step.

First, reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) + Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) → BaSO4 (0.09 mol) + 2 H2O.

So, after this reaction, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol left.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 mol) will dissociate into 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl (0.1 mol H+) will react with this OH-.

So H+ (0.1) + OH- (0.02) → 0.02 mol H2O. So H+ left: 0.08.

So the total neutralization would be from the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction (producing 2 H2O per mole) and the remaining Ba(OH)2 reacting with HCl.

Wait, but perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different than that for HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, but the enthalpy of neutralization is typically considered per mole of H+ and OH- reacting, regardless of the acid or base.

Wait, but in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes two moles of OH-? Or wait, no, the reaction is 1 H2SO4 + 1 Ba(OH)2 → 1 BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 2 H+ and 2 OH-, producing 2 H2O.

So the enthalpy change for this reaction would be 2 * (55.8 kJ) → 111.6 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's -111.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+.

So for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

The reaction: 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So 2 moles of H+ and 2 moles of OH- react, releasing 2 *55.8 =111.6 kJ.

So for the 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacting, it provides 0.18 mol H+.

And 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

So all of the H+ and OH- from these (0.18 each) will react, releasing 0.18 *55.8 =10.044 kJ.

Wait, but that approach seems conflicting with the previous.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the better approach is to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- from all sources and see how much reacts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- available and find the minimum.

Total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 *2 =0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ =0.28.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 *2 =0.2 mol.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol H+ will react, releasing 0.2 *55.8 =11.16 kJ.

So the total ΔH is -11.16 kJ.

Looking at the options, this would be approximately -11.2 kJ. But none of the options match except if option B is in kJ. But option B is in kcal.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the only option that's in the same ballpark is option D at -16 kJ, but that's larger than our calculated -11.16 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and that the second H+ may not dissociate completely. But I think for the purposes of this problem, we can assume complete dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 produces two moles of water per mole of acid, and each mole of water formation releases 55.8 kJ. So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, 0.18 mol H+ would react with 0.18 mol OH-.

But wait, the OH- available is 0.2 mol. So if 0.18 mol OH- is used in the reaction with H2SO4, then the remaining 0.02 mol OH- will react with HCl.

So let's break it into two steps:

1. Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 mol), producing BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

This would release 0.18 *55.8 = 10.044 kJ.

2. Remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol. It provides 0.02 mol OH-.

This reacts with HCl: 0.02 mol H+ from HCl reacts, releasing 0.02 *55.8 =1.116 kJ.

3. Remaining HCl: 0.1 -0.02 =0.08 mol H+.

So total heat released is 10.044 +1.116 =11.16 kJ → -11.16 kJ.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, the options list option B as -11.42 kcal. Let me compute that in kJ: 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈47.85 kJ. So that's about 47.85 kJ. Which is much larger than our 11.16 kJ.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is in terms of the total possible neutralization, not considering the excess.

Wait, suppose all the H+ and OH- are neutralized.

Total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So if they all reacted, 0.2 mol H+ would react, and 0.08 remains. But that's the same as before.

Hmm. I think I've reached the conclusion that the correct answer is approximately -11.2 kJ, but since the options don't have this, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and then multiply by the enthalpy per mole. Let me recalculate.

Total H+ =0.28.

Total OH- =0.2.

So the limiting reagent is OH- (0.2 mol). So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react.

Each mole releases 55.8 kJ, so 0.2 *55.8 =11.16 kJ.

So ΔH = -11.16 kJ.

But none of the options match, except if option B is -11.42 kJ, but it's listed as kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ΔH, like -57 kJ/mol.

0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which would be approximately -11.4 kJ. But again, none of the options match except if option B is converted.

Wait, if the enthalpy is calculated as 0.2 * (-55.8) kJ, that's 11.16 kJ, but perhaps the problem uses -57 kJ/mol, making it 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ.

So the total ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is often given as about -28.0 kJ/mol. But that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and use the standard enthalpy.

So the correct ΔH is -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the closest.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about -3.82 kcal. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mixing of all three solutions, but I'm not considering that some reactions may produce more or less heat.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH-, find the minimum, and then multiply by the enthalpy.

But I've done that and it's 0.2 mol.

So why is the option D there?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, it produces two moles of water per mole of H2SO4.

So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, it produces 0.18 mol H2O. Each mole of H2O formation releases 55.8 kJ. So 0.18 *55.8 =10.044 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 mol) reacts with HCl. 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 →0.02 mol OH-.

Which reacts with 0.02 mol H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 *55.8 =1.116 kJ.

Total ΔH:10.044 +1.116=11.16 kJ.

Same as before.

So the answer should be about -11.16 kJ, which is approximately -2.67 kcal.

But the options give -2.72 kcal (option A).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for ΔH, such as -57.3 kJ/mol.

0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ.

Which is -11.46 kJ.

If the problem uses this value, then the total would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -2.75 kcal.

Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

So I think the intended answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each molecule of H₂SO₄ provides 2 H⁺ ions, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each molecule of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Determine the limiting reactant
The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
- Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reactant (0.2 mol < 0.28 mol), all 0.2 mol of OH⁻ will react, consuming 0.2 mol of H⁺.

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( \Delta H = -55.8 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻.  
For 0.2 mol of OH⁻ reacting:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-55.8 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.16 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
To convert \( -11.16 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
\[
-11.16 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.67 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Closest to the calculated value of \( -2.67 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Represents a much larger value, inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Also inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Larger than the calculated \( -11.16 \, \text{kJ} \), so incorrect.

### Final Answer
The closest match to the calculated value is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.
