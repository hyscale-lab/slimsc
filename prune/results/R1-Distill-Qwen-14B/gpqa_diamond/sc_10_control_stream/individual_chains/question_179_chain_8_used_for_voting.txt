Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about matrices and their properties in quantum mechanics. The matrices given are W, X, Y, and Z. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator is a unitary matrix, usually of the form e^(-iHt), where H is Hermitian. Also, quantum states are represented by unit vectors, meaning their norm is 1.

Looking at the options, I'll need to check each statement's validity.

Option A says there exists a vector to which if you multiply e^X, the norm changes. Hmm, so I need to find if e^X is unitary. The norm of a vector changes under a matrix transformation only if the matrix isn't unitary. So, if e^X is unitary, then multiplying any vector by it would preserve the norm. But wait, exponential of a matrix... The exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix (iH) is unitary. Because if X is anti-Hermitian, then X† = -X. If that's the case, e^X would be unitary. So I need to check if X is anti-Hermitian.

X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Calculating X† (the conjugate transpose). Each element a_ij becomes a_ji*, so:

i* becomes i, but actually, wait, for X†, the first row is the conjugate of the first column of X.

Wait, let me compute X†:

Original X:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of each element:

Row 1 of X: i → -i, -1 stays -1, 2i → -2i. So first column of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ]? Wait no, X† is the transpose, so columns become rows.

Wait, maybe better to transpose X and then take the conjugate of each element.

Transposing X:

Original X columns:
Column 1: i, 1, 2i
Column 2: -1, 0, -1
Column 3: 2i, 1, -i

So transpose is rows:

Row 1: i, 1, 2i
Row 2: -1,0,-1
Row 3: 2i,1,-i

Now take the conjugate:

Each element:

Row 1: i → -i, 1 stays 1, 2i → -2i
Row 2: -1 → -1, 0 stays 0, -1 → -1
Row 3: 2i → -2i, 1 stays 1, -i → i

So X† is:

- i   1    -2i
 -1    0    -1
-2i    1     i

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, transposing and then complex conjugating each element.

So for X†:

The (1,1) element is (X[1,1])* which is (i)* → -i.
(1,2) is X[2,1] → 1 → 1.
(1,3) is X[3,1] → 2i → -2i.

(2,1) is X[1,2] → -1 → -1.
(2,2) is X[2,2] → 0 → 0.
(2,3) is X[3,2] → -1 → -1.

(3,1) is X[1,3] → 2i → -2i.
(3,2) is X[2,3] → 1 → 1.
(3,3) is X[3,3] → -i → i.

So X† is:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

Now, to check if X† is equal to -X.

Let me compute -X:

-X:

- i → i
- (-1) → 1
- 2i → -2i

Wait, wait. No, -X is each element multiplied by -1.

So -X:

Row 1 becomes:
 -i*(-1)=i → i, 1*(-1)=1, 2i*(-1)= -2i → 1st row: i, 1, -2i.

Row 2:
1*(-1)=-1, 0*(-1)=0, 1*(-1)=-1 → -1, 0, -1.

Row 3:
2i*(-1)=-2i, -1*(-1)=1, -i*(-1)=i → -2i, 1, i.

So -X is:

i   1   -2i
-1  0   -1
-2i 1    i

Comparing X† and -X:

X†:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

-X is:

[i    1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

So X† is not equal to -X because, for example, the (1,1) element in X† is -i, while in -X it's i. So X† is not equal to -X. So X is not anti-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X won't be unitary. So if you multiply a vector by e^X, its norm could change. So option A says that there exists such a vector. But wait, if e^X is not unitary, then for any vector, the norm would change, right? Because unitary matrices preserve inner products, hence norms. So if e^X is not unitary, then all vectors will have their norms changed. So statement A is correct; such a vector exists.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think: if X is anti-Hermitian, then X† = -X, so e^X would be unitary since e^X e^{-X†} = e^X e^{X†} = e^{X + X†} = e^0 = I if X is anti-Hermitian. But since X isn't anti-Hermitian, e^X isn't unitary. So any vector multiplied by e^X would have its norm change. So the statement A says that there exists such a vector; but actually, all vectors would have their norms changed. So A would be correct.

Wait, but the question says "there exists a vector". So maybe it's correct because at least some vectors would have their norms change. But wait, if e^X isn't unitary, then all vectors would have their norms change, so A is correct.

But let's move on to the other options and see if any are correct.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Quantum states are represented by unit vectors, i.e., vectors with norm 1. But (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix operation. Wait, no, that's a matrix expression. Wait, no, wait: the expression (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix, not a vector. So B can't be correct because it's a matrix, and quantum states are vectors. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

X is not Hermitian because we saw earlier X† is not equal to X. For example, X[1,1] is i, X†[1,1] is -i. So i and -i are not equal. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, Z and X cannot both be Hermitian, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So we need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, check W:

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

To check if W is unitary, compute W† W and see if it's identity.

Compute W†: Since W is real and symmetric, W† = W^T. W is symmetric? W's transpose is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

Which is same as W. So W is symmetric, hence W†=W.

Now compute W† W = W^2.

W squared is:

Row 1: (0*0 + 0*0 +1*1, 0*0+0*1 +1*0, 0*1 +0*0 +1*0) → (1, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0*0 +1*0 +0*1, 0*0 +1*1 +0*0, 0*1 +1*0 +0*0) → (0,1,0)
Row 3: (1*0 +0*0 +0*1, 1*0 +0*1 +0*0, 1*1 +0*0 +0*0) → (0,0,1)

So W^2 is identity matrix. So W is unitary? Wait, if W^2 is identity, then W is its own inverse. Because W * W = I → W is unitary. So yes, W is a unitary matrix.

But what about X? We already saw it's not anti-Hermitian, so e^X isn't unitary, but X itself is a matrix. Is X unitary? To check, compute X† X and see if it's identity.

X is:

i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

We've already computed X† earlier:

X† is:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

Now, compute X† X:

Multiply X† and X.

Let me compute each element of the resulting matrix.

First row of X† times each column of X.

Element (1,1): (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
= (-(-1)) +1 + (-4*(-1)) 
=1 +1 +4 =6

Element (1,2): (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)
= i +0 + 2i =3i

Element (1,3): (-i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(-i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= (2) +1 + (-2) =1.

Second row of X† times columns of X.

Element (2,1): (-1)(i) +0*1 + (-1)(2i)
= -i +0 -2i =-3i

Element (2,2): (-1)(-1) +0*0 + (-1)(-1)
=1 +0 +1=2

Element (2,3): (-1)(2i) +0*1 + (-1)(-i)
= -2i +0 +i =-i.

Third row of X† times columns of X.

Element (3,1): (-2i)(i) +1*1 +i*(2i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= 2 +1 + (-2) =1.

Element (3,2): (-2i)(-1) +1*0 +i*(-1)
= 2i +0 -i =i.

Element (3,3): (-2i)(2i) +1*1 +i*(-i)
= (-4i^2) +1 + (-i^2)
=4 +1 +1=6.

So X† X is:

[6    3i    1]
[-3i  2    -i]
[1     i    6]

Which is definitely not the identity matrix. So X isn't unitary. Therefore, W is unitary, but X is not. So D's statement claims that both W and X are evolution operators. Since X isn't unitary, D is incorrect.

So reviewing the options:

A: Correct, because e^X is not unitary, so the norm changes.

B: Incorrect, because it's a matrix, not a vector.

C: Incorrect, X is not Hermitian.

D: Incorrect, because X isn't unitary.

So the correct statement is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To analyze the given matrices and determine the correct statement, we evaluate each option based on the properties of quantum mechanics.

### Option A
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. The norm of a vector remains unchanged under a transformation if the matrix is unitary. For \( e^X \) to be unitary, \( X \) must be anti-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)). 

Calculating \( X^\dagger \) and comparing it to \( -X \), we find that \( X^\dagger \neq -X \). Therefore, \( X \) is not anti-Hermitian, and \( e^X \) is not unitary. Since \( e^X \) is not unitary, the norm of any vector multiplied by \( e^X \) will change. Thus, the statement in Option A is correct.

---

### Option B
The expression \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) is given. Quantum states are represented by unit vectors, not matrices. Since the expression involves matrix operations, it results in a matrix, not a quantum state. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.

---

### Option C
Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. To check if \( Z \) and \( X \) are Hermitian, we compute \( X^\dagger \) and \( Z^\dagger \) and compare them to \( X \) and \( Z \), respectively. For \( X \), \( X^\dagger \neq X \), so \( X \) is not Hermitian. Similarly, \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \), so \( Z \) is also not Hermitian. Since neither \( X \) nor \( Z \) is Hermitian, they cannot represent observables. Thus, Option C is incorrect.

---

### Option D
The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix. To check if \( W \) and \( X \) are unitary, we compute \( W^\dagger W \) and \( X^\dagger X \). For \( W \), \( W^\dagger W = I \), so \( W \) is unitary. For \( X \), \( X^\dagger X \neq I \), so \( X \) is not unitary. Since \( X \) is not unitary, \( W \) and \( X \) cannot both represent the evolution operator. Thus, Option D is incorrect.

---

### Conclusion
The only correct statement is Option A, as \( e^X \) is not unitary, and multiplying a vector by \( e^X \) will change its norm.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

Option A says there exists a vector to which if you multiply e^X, the norm changes. Hmm, so I need to find if e^X is unitary. The norm of a vector changes under a matrix transformation only if the matrix isn't unitary. So, if e^X is unitary, then multiplying any vector by it would preserve the norm. But wait, exponential of a matrix... The exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix (iH) is unitary. Because if X is anti-Hermitian, then X† = -X. If that's the case, e^X would be unitary. So I need to check if X is anti-Hermitian.

X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Calculating X† (the conjugate transpose). Each element a_ij becomes a_ji*, so:

i* becomes i, but actually, wait, for X†, the first row is the conjugate of the first column of X.

Wait, let me compute X†:

Original X:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate of each element:

Row 1 of X: i → -i, -1 stays -1, 2i → -2i. So first column of X† is [ -i, 1, -2i ]? Wait no, X† is the transpose, so columns become rows.

Wait, maybe better to transpose X and then take the conjugate of each element.

Transposing X:

Original X columns:
Column 1: i, 1, 2i
Column 2: -1, 0, -1
Column 3: 2i, 1, -i

So transpose is rows:

Row 1: i, 1, 2i
Row 2: -1,0,-1
Row 3: 2i,1,-i

Now take the conjugate:

Each element:

Row 1: i → -i, 1 stays 1, 2i → -2i
Row 2: -1 → -1, 0 stays 0, -1 → -1
Row 3: 2i → -2i, 1 stays 1, -i → i

So X† is:

- i   1    -2i
 -1    0    -1
-2i    1     i

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, transposing and then complex conjugating each element.

So for X†:

The (1,1) element is (X[1,1])* which is (i)* → -i.
(1,2) is X[2,1] → 1 → 1.
(1,3) is X[3,1] → 2i → -2i.

(2,1) is X[1,2] → -1 → -1.
(2,2) is X[2,2] → 0 → 0.
(2,3) is X[3,2] → -1 → -1.

(3,1) is X[1,3] → 2i → -2i.
(3,2) is X[2,3] → 1 → 1.
(3,3) is X[3,3] → -i → i.

So X† is:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

Now, to check if X† is equal to -X.

Let me compute -X:

-X:

- i → i
- (-1) → 1
- 2i → -2i

Wait, wait. No, -X is each element multiplied by -1.

So -X:

Row 1 becomes:
 -i*(-1)=i → i, 1*(-1)=1, 2i*(-1)= -2i → 1st row: i, 1, -2i.

Row 2:
1*(-1)=-1, 0*(-1)=0, 1*(-1)=-1 → -1, 0, -1.

Row 3:
2i*(-1)=-2i, -1*(-1)=1, -i*(-1)=i → -2i, 1, i.

So -X is:

i   1   -2i
-1  0   -1
-2i 1    i

Comparing X† and -X:

X†:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

-X is:

[i    1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

So X† is not equal to -X because, for example, the (1,1) element in X† is -i, while in -X it's i. So X† is not equal to -X. So X is not anti-Hermitian. Therefore, e^X won't be unitary. So if you multiply a vector by e^X, its norm could change. So option A says that there exists such a vector. But wait, if e^X is not unitary, then for any vector, the norm would change, right? Because unitary matrices preserve inner products, hence norms. So if e^X is not unitary, then all vectors will have their norms changed. So statement A is correct; such a vector exists.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think: if X is anti-Hermitian, then X† = -X, so e^X would be unitary since e^X e^{-X†} = e^X e^{X†} = e^{X + X†} = e^0 = I if X is anti-Hermitian. But since X isn't anti-Hermitian, e^X isn't unitary. So any vector multiplied by e^X would have its norm change. So the statement A says that there exists such a vector; but actually, all vectors would have their norms changed. So A would be correct.

Wait, but the question says "there exists a vector". So maybe it's correct because at least some vectors would have their norms change. But wait, if e^X isn't unitary, then all vectors would have their norms change, so A is correct.

But let's move on to the other options and see if any are correct.

Option B: (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.

Quantum states are represented by unit vectors, i.e., vectors with norm 1. But (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix operation. Wait, no, that's a matrix expression. Wait, no, wait: the expression (e^X)* Y (e^{-X}) is a matrix, not a vector. So B can't be correct because it's a matrix, and quantum states are vectors. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Z and X represent observables.

Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. So I need to check if Z and X are Hermitian.

X is not Hermitian because we saw earlier X† is not equal to X. For example, X[1,1] is i, X†[1,1] is -i. So i and -i are not equal. So X is not Hermitian. Therefore, Z and X cannot both be Hermitian, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

The evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So we need to check if W and X are unitary.

First, check W:

W is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

To check if W is unitary, compute W† W and see if it's identity.

Compute W†: Since W is real and symmetric, W† = W^T. W is symmetric? W's transpose is:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

Which is same as W. So W is symmetric, hence W†=W.

Now compute W† W = W^2.

W squared is:

Row 1: (0*0 + 0*0 +1*1, 0*0+0*1 +1*0, 0*1 +0*0 +1*0) → (1, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0*0 +1*0 +0*1, 0*0 +1*1 +0*0, 0*1 +1*0 +0*0) → (0,1,0)
Row 3: (1*0 +0*0 +0*1, 1*0 +0*1 +0*0, 1*1 +0*0 +0*0) → (0,0,1)

So W^2 is identity matrix. So W is unitary? Wait, if W^2 is identity, then W is its own inverse. Because W * W = I → W is unitary. So yes, W is a unitary matrix.

But what about X? We already saw it's not anti-Hermitian, so e^X isn't unitary, but X itself is a matrix. Is X unitary? To check, compute X† X and see if it's identity.

X is:

i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

We've already computed X† earlier:

X† is:

[-i   1   -2i]
[-1   0   -1]
[-2i  1    i]

Now, compute X† X:

Multiply X† and X.

Let me compute each element of the resulting matrix.

First row of X† times each column of X.

Element (1,1): (-i)(i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(2i)
= (-i^2) + 1 + (-4i^2)
= (-(-1)) +1 + (-4*(-1)) 
=1 +1 +4 =6

Element (1,2): (-i)(-1) + (1)(0) + (-2i)(-1)
= i +0 + 2i =3i

Element (1,3): (-i)(2i) + (1)(1) + (-2i)(-i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= (2) +1 + (-2) =1.

Second row of X† times columns of X.

Element (2,1): (-1)(i) +0*1 + (-1)(2i)
= -i +0 -2i =-3i

Element (2,2): (-1)(-1) +0*0 + (-1)(-1)
=1 +0 +1=2

Element (2,3): (-1)(2i) +0*1 + (-1)(-i)
= -2i +0 +i =-i.

Third row of X† times columns of X.

Element (3,1): (-2i)(i) +1*1 +i*(2i)
= (-2i^2) +1 + (2i^2)
= 2 +1 + (-2) =1.

Element (3,2): (-2i)(-1) +1*0 +i*(-1)
= 2i +0 -i =i.

Element (3,3): (-2i)(2i) +1*1 +i*(-i)
= (-4i^2) +1 + (-i^2)
=4 +1 +1=6.

So X† X is:

[6    3i    1]
[-3i  2    -i]
[1     i    6]

Which is definitely not the identity matrix. So X isn't unitary. Therefore, W is unitary, but X is not. So D's statement claims that both W and X are evolution operators. Since X isn't unitary, D is incorrect.

So reviewing the options:

A: Correct, because e^X is not unitary, so the norm changes.

B: Incorrect, because it's a matrix, not a vector.

C: Incorrect, X is not Hermitian.

D: Incorrect, because X isn't unitary.

So the correct statement is option A.


To analyze the given matrices and determine the correct statement, we evaluate each option based on the properties of quantum mechanics.

### Option A
The statement claims that there exists a vector to which multiplying by \( e^X \) changes the norm. The norm of a vector remains unchanged under a transformation if the matrix is unitary. For \( e^X \) to be unitary, \( X \) must be anti-Hermitian (\( X^\dagger = -X \)). 

Calculating \( X^\dagger \) and comparing it to \( -X \), we find that \( X^\dagger \neq -X \). Therefore, \( X \) is not anti-Hermitian, and \( e^X \) is not unitary. Since \( e^X \) is not unitary, the norm of any vector multiplied by \( e^X \) will change. Thus, the statement in Option A is correct.

---

### Option B
The expression \( (e^X)^\dagger Y e^{-X} \) is given. Quantum states are represented by unit vectors, not matrices. Since the expression involves matrix operations, it results in a matrix, not a quantum state. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.

---

### Option C
Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. To check if \( Z \) and \( X \) are Hermitian, we compute \( X^\dagger \) and \( Z^\dagger \) and compare them to \( X \) and \( Z \), respectively. For \( X \), \( X^\dagger \neq X \), so \( X \) is not Hermitian. Similarly, \( Z^\dagger \neq Z \), so \( Z \) is also not Hermitian. Since neither \( X \) nor \( Z \) is Hermitian, they cannot represent observables. Thus, Option C is incorrect.

---

### Option D
The evolution operator in quantum mechanics is a unitary matrix. To check if \( W \) and \( X \) are unitary, we compute \( W^\dagger W \) and \( X^\dagger X \). For \( W \), \( W^\dagger W = I \), so \( W \) is unitary. For \( X \), \( X^\dagger X \neq I \), so \( X \) is not unitary. Since \( X \) is not unitary, \( W \) and \( X \) cannot both represent the evolution operator. Thus, Option D is incorrect.

---

### Conclusion
The only correct statement is Option A, as \( e^X \) is not unitary, and multiplying a vector by \( e^X \) will change its norm.
