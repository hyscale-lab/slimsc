Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, but it's probably embedded in a higher-dimensional space or maybe it's a model of anti-de Sitter space or something similar. Oh wait, pseudosphere—oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like in hyperbolic geometry. 

The question is about finding the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, wait, pseudosphere usually refers to something else, like a tractricoid, but I think in this context, they're treating it as a two-dimensional surface with a specific metric.

So, to find the area, I need to compute the area of the space described by this metric. Since it's a two-dimensional metric, the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. Let's see, the metric is diagonal here, so the determinant would be just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait no, wait, because the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy². Since the cross terms are zero, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the metric might be written in a way that's more suited to a different coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe the area is found by integrating the area element over the allowed region of x and y.

What's the domain of x and y? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the metric would be singular when that denominator is zero. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the coordinates x and y are constrained to the circle of radius 2. So the region is a disk of radius 2, but with a metric that's scaled by 32/(4 - r²), where r is sqrt(x² + y²).

Wait, let me think about this. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. Wait, because in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ, but when you have a metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Let me compute the determinant of the metric in polar coordinates. The metric tensor in polar would have the components:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²)
g_rθ = g_θr = 0

So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2

So sqrt(det g) would be (32 r)/(4 - r²)

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So to find the total area, we need to integrate this over the allowed r and θ. The radius r goes from 0 to 2 (since r=2 is the maximum allowed without the denominator becoming zero). θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute that. Let's separate the integrals:

A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

The θ integral is simply 2π. So:

A = 2π * ∫(0 to2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

Let me compute this integral. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = -16 ∫ du/u = -16 ln|u| + C.

Wait, but since u = 4 - r², when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral from 0 to 2 is from u=4 to u=0.

So substituting the limits:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-∞) - ln4 ] → but this is problematic because ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that can't be right. Because as r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the integral becomes:

∫ from r=0 to r=2 of [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 -r²)] from 0 to 2.

Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me redo it.

Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du / u ]

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u → -16 ∫ du/u.

The integral ∫ du/u is ln|u|.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2 is equivalent to u=4 to u=0. So:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) is -∞. So it's -16 [ (-∞) - ln4 ] → which is -16 ( -∞ - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. Because (-∞) is a huge negative number. So it's -16 multiplied by that, making it positive infinity. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is finite, right? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't for a pseudosphere but for a different surface.

Wait, but the question says the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The metric given in the question is ds² = 32/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, it becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] ( dr² + r² dθ² )

Hmm, but for a pseudosphere ( tractricoid ), the metric would have a different form. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the area is indeed infinite because the metric becomes singular at r=2, and the area integral diverges.

Alternatively, maybe the area is finite. Let me think about the integral again. Let's compute it step by step.

Compute the integral ∫ (32 r) / (4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me use substitution again. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-16) ∫ (du/u )

Which is (-16) ln|u| + C. Now, evaluate from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So it becomes (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-16)(-infty - ln4) = (-16)(-infty) + (-16)(-ln4) → which is positive infinity plus 16 ln4.

So the integral diverges to positive infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. So when you multiply by 2π, the area becomes infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why would the area be infinite? The pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Or wait, maybe the metric provided isn't that of a pseudosphere but is a different kind of surface. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the models of hyperbolic space. The metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model, which is a model of hyperbolic geometry where the metric is ds² = [4/(1 + x² + y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's different from the given metric. So maybe the given metric is not the standard hyperbolic model.

But regardless, the area we're calculating here is the integral over the allowed r. Since r goes up to 2, and the integral diverges, the area is infinite. So the answer should be D, +infty.

Looking back at the options:

A) 0 → No, integral isn't zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That's a function, but the area should be a number.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Again, a function, not the area.

D) +infty → Which is what we found.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the area of the pseudosphere with the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

we first compute the area element. In polar coordinates, where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor components are:

\[
g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{r\theta} = g_{\theta r} = 0.
\]

Thus, \(\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}\). Taking the square root, we find:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The area element is therefore:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the allowed region of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) are constrained by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which translates to \(r^2 < 4\). Hence, \(r\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\), and \(\theta\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral. Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Here, \(\ln(0)\) is \(-\infty\), and \(\ln(4)\) is finite. Thus, the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is a function, not a numerical value.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is also a function, not a numerical value.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, but it's probably embedded in a higher-dimensional space or maybe it's a model of anti-de Sitter space or something similar. Oh wait, pseudosphere—oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like in hyperbolic geometry. 

The question is about finding the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, wait, pseudosphere usually refers to something else, like a tractricoid, but I think in this context, they're treating it as a two-dimensional surface with a specific metric.

So, to find the area, I need to compute the area of the space described by this metric. Since it's a two-dimensional metric, the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. Let's see, the metric is diagonal here, so the determinant would be just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait no, wait, because the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy². Since the cross terms are zero, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

But wait, the metric might be written in a way that's more suited to a different coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe the area is found by integrating the area element over the allowed region of x and y.

What's the domain of x and y? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the metric would be singular when that denominator is zero. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the coordinates x and y are constrained to the circle of radius 2. So the region is a disk of radius 2, but with a metric that's scaled by 32/(4 - r²), where r is sqrt(x² + y²).

Wait, let me think about this. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. Wait, because in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ, but when you have a metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Let me compute the determinant of the metric in polar coordinates. The metric tensor in polar would have the components:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²)
g_rθ = g_θr = 0

So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2

So sqrt(det g) would be (32 r)/(4 - r²)

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So to find the total area, we need to integrate this over the allowed r and θ. The radius r goes from 0 to 2 (since r=2 is the maximum allowed without the denominator becoming zero). θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute that. Let's separate the integrals:

A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

The θ integral is simply 2π. So:

A = 2π * ∫(0 to2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr

Let me compute this integral. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = -16 ∫ du/u = -16 ln|u| + C.

Wait, but since u = 4 - r², when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral from 0 to 2 is from u=4 to u=0.

So substituting the limits:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ (-∞) - ln4 ] → but this is problematic because ln(0) is negative infinity. Wait, that can't be right. Because as r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0 from above. So the integral becomes:

∫ from r=0 to r=2 of [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [r dr/(4 -r²)] from 0 to 2.

Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me redo it.

Let me let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-1/2) du / u ]

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ du/u → -16 ∫ du/u.

The integral ∫ du/u is ln|u|.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2 is equivalent to u=4 to u=0. So:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so ln(0) is -∞. So it's -16 [ (-∞) - ln4 ] → which is -16 ( -∞ - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. Because (-∞) is a huge negative number. So it's -16 multiplied by that, making it positive infinity. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is finite, right? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given isn't for a pseudosphere but for a different surface.

Wait, but the question says the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The metric given in the question is ds² = 32/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, it becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] ( dr² + r² dθ² )

Hmm, but for a pseudosphere ( tractricoid ), the metric would have a different form. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the area is indeed infinite because the metric becomes singular at r=2, and the area integral diverges.

Alternatively, maybe the area is finite. Let me think about the integral again. Let's compute it step by step.

Compute the integral ∫ (32 r) / (4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me use substitution again. Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr / (4 - r²) ] = 32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-16) ∫ (du/u )

Which is (-16) ln|u| + C. Now, evaluate from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0).

So it becomes (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-16)(-infty - ln4) = (-16)(-infty) + (-16)(-ln4) → which is positive infinity plus 16 ln4.

So the integral diverges to positive infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. So when you multiply by 2π, the area becomes infinite.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but why would the area be infinite? The pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Or wait, maybe the metric provided isn't that of a pseudosphere but is a different kind of surface. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the models of hyperbolic space.

Wait, that's different from the given metric. So maybe the given metric is not the standard hyperbolic model.

But regardless, the area we're calculating here is the integral over the allowed r. Since r goes up to 2, and the integral diverges, the area is infinite. So the answer should be D, +infty.

Looking back at the options:

A) 0 → No, integral isn't zero.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That's a function, but the area should be a number.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Again, a function, not the area.

D) +infty → Which is what we found.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the area of the pseudosphere with the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

we first compute the area element. In polar coordinates, where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in polar coordinates is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor components are:

\[
g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{r\theta} = g_{\theta r} = 0.
\]

Thus, \(\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}\). Taking the square root, we find:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2}.
\]

The area element is therefore:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the allowed region of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) are constrained by the condition \(4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0\), which translates to \(r^2 < 4\). Hence, \(r\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\), and \(\theta\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \(\theta\):

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral. Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), or \(-\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

Reversing the limits of integration:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u} = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Here, \(\ln(0)\) is \(-\infty\), and \(\ln(4)\) is finite. Thus, the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is a function, not a numerical value.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is also a function, not a numerical value.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Answer: D
