Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question to tackle. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions and its reaction kinetics. Hmm, I remember that electrochemistry involves redox reactions, and in such reactions, the oxidizing power (strength of oxidant) and reaction rate (kinetics) are important factors. 

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. We need to choose the correct combination from the options.

First, let's break down the two parts: thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

Starting with the thermodynamic part. I recall that the standard reduction potential of O2 is higher in basic solutions compared to acidic. Because in basic conditions, the reaction might be more favorable. The standard E for O2 in basic is around 0.401 V, whereas in acidic it's about 1.23 V. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I might have that backwards. Let me think. The reduction of O2 in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ + 2e^- → 2H2O, which has a E° of around 1.23 V. In basic solution, without H+ ions, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, with E° around 0.401 V. So, the E° is higher in acidic solution. 

Wait, but the question is about whether O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic. A stronger oxidant has a higher E°. So in acidic, E° is higher, meaning O2 is a stronger oxidant there. In basic, E° is lower, so it's a weaker oxidant. So, thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Because basic has a lower E°, making O2 less likely to be reduced. So the first blank should be filled with "weaker".

Now the kinetic part. The question is about how O2 reacts in acidic solutions. Kinetics is about the rate. I remember that the reaction rate of O2 depends on the concentration of H+ ions. In acidic solutions, H+ is present in higher concentration, which might increase the reaction rate. Because the reaction involves H+ ions, like in the acidic case: O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. Since H+ is available, the reaction can proceed more quickly. Whereas in basic solutions, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-, which might proceed more slowly because of the need to form OH^- rather than using available H+. So, in acidic solutions, the reaction with O2 is faster.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic, and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. So the blanks should be filled with weaker and faster. 

Looking at the options:

Option C: weaker – faster
Option D: weaker - slower

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The first part is about being an oxidant in basic solutions. So if the standard E is lower, that makes O2 a weaker oxidant. So for the first blank, 'weaker' is correct.

The second part is about kinetic in acidic. So O2 reacts faster in acidic. So, the second blank is 'faster'. So the correct combination is 'weaker' and 'faster', which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The options are:

A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

So the correct answer is option C: weaker and faster.

Thermodynamically, the oxidizing power of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In basic solutions, the standard reduction potential of oxygen is lower (approximately 0.401 V) compared to acidic solutions (approximately 1.23 V). A lower reduction potential indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. 

Kinetically, the reaction rate of oxygen depends on the availability of ions like H⁺. In acidic solutions, H⁺ ions are present in higher concentrations, which facilitates the reaction of oxygen (e.g., O₂ + 4H⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2H₂O), making the reaction faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the reaction involves OH⁻ ions (e.g., O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻), which typically proceeds more slowly due to the need to form OH⁻. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions. The correct combination is "weaker – faster."
