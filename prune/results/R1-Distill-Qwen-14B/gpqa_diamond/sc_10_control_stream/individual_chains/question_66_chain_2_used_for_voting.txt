Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's the deal with SMEFT? I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write the Standard Model as an effective theory by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and each dimension adds terms that are suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale or something.

Now, symmetries in physics are crucial because operators in the Lagrangian must respect the underlying symmetries of the theory. So the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

Let me go through each symmetry one by one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators must transform properly under the Lorentz group. So yes, Lorentz symmetry must be respected because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a relativistic quantum field theory. So 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry would imply momentum conservation, etc. But wait, in effective field theories, do they generally respect Poincare symmetry? I think they do. Because EFTs are built as Lorentz-invariant theories. But wait, wait a second—sometimes when you have higher-dimensional operators, you might get terms that don't respect Poincare? Or is that not the case? No, wait. No, the SMEFT is constructed to respect Poincare symmetry because it's built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So 2 must be correct as well.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it doesn't necessarily have to be Poincare-invariant unless it also respects translation invariance. But wait, effective field theories are local, so they should respect translations. So SMEFT respects both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

3. CP symmetry: Hmm. Wait, the Standard Model itself isn't CP-symmetric. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So if the SM isn't CP-symmetric, then SMEFT, which includes the SM plus higher-dimension terms, wouldn't necessarily respect CP either. So I think that operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. Because in the SM, some operators already violate CP. So 3 is not a must-respected symmetry.

4. CPT symmetry: I remember that all Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way the symmetries combine, especially because Lorentz symmetry and the spin-statistics theorem require CPT symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. So 4 is correct.

So putting it together: The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So looking at the options, the correct choice should include 1,2,4. Let's check the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Wait, earlier I thought Poincare is included because SMEFT is Lorentz and translation invariant. But is that always the case? Or is Poincare symmetry automatically satisfied if Lorentz and translation symmetries are already present?

I think Poincare includes both, so if a theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant, it must respect Poincare. Since SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, it's also Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, another thought: The SM respects Poincare symmetry. SMEFT is an extension, so I think all its terms must respect Poincare symmetry. So yes, 2 is correct.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators in SMEFT must transform properly under the Lorentz group, as it is a relativistic quantum field theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM), from which SMEFT extends, is not CP-symmetric. For example, CP violation is present due to the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT includes the SM and higher-dimensional operators, it does not necessarily respect CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: All Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry. This symmetry arises from the combination of Lorentz symmetry and the spin-statistics theorem. Thus, CPT symmetry must be respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.
