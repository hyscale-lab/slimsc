Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound X was, choosing from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Wait, no, wait. Sharpless epoxidation uses a different catalyst, but this reagent is a base or maybe an acid scavenger. Oh, right, wait! Actually, this reagent is often used in the epoxidation of alkenes, specifically in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Or wait, maybe it's part of the conditions for epoxide formation using peracids. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, right! I think this reagent is used in the epoxidation of alkenes via the Prilezhaev oxidation. The reaction is typically done with a peracid, and 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is used as a base to deprotonate the peracid, making it a better oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the product here is an epoxide, right? Because the options all have 'oxirane' or 'epoxide' in their names. So the reaction is epoxidizing an alkene.

So, the starting material, compound X, is an alkene that upon reaction forms an epoxide. So the product is the epoxide, and we need to find out what the starting alkene was.

Looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's analyze the 1H and 13C NMR.

First, the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring? Or perhaps part of an epoxide? Hmm, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe here it's something else.
- δ2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same integration. So two singlet methyl groups. Wait, but integration is 3H each. So two different methyl groups, each as singlets. So maybe two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Like maybe attached to carbonyls, or perhaps in a ring.
Wait, but the product is an epoxide, which is an oxygen-containing ring. So perhaps the starting material was an alkene with substituents that lead to an epoxide with these substituents.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- δ6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. So maybe a coupling with one proton.
- δ7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Could be adjacent to each other in an aromatic ring.
- δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.
- δ7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about how the aromatic signals could correspond. Maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a styrene structure, like a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but the product's NMR is for the epoxide, right? So the epoxide would have the oxygen in a three-membered ring, and the other parts would be substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkene, which after epoxidation becomes an epoxide. So the product's structure would have an epoxide group connected to some substituents.

Let me try to draw this. The product would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring, with two adjacent carbons, each connected to other substituents.

But looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals suggest that the substituents are perhaps in a particular arrangement. Let me think of the coupling patterns.

The aromatic protons: 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). So maybe there are two sets of doublets. Perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but not para. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans or cis arrangement.

Wait, considering the coupling, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. But how would that fit with the doublets? Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene, making a styrene.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the 13C NMR.

13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): Very low shift, maybe a methyl attached to something. Like a CH3 in a CH2 group, or maybe a CH3 attached to oxygen? Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are attached to a carbonyl, like ketone.

Wait, but in the product, which is the epoxide, the carbons would be from the epoxide ring and any substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 and 28.4: These are two single carbons, each as singlets. 21 ppm is typically a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, perhaps. 28.4 is a bit higher, maybe a CH2 or another CH3 attached to something else.

The rest of the carbons are around 126-144 ppm, which is in the aromatic region. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the product is an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's confusing. Wait, unless the starting material had a carbonyl and the reaction didn't affect it.

Wait, the starting material is compound X, which is being epoxidized. So the product would have the epoxide group, but other functional groups from X would remain.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7 ppm. That's a very high chemical shift, typically for a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. So the product has a carbonyl group. Hmm, but the reaction is an epoxidation, which typically uses peracids and forms an epoxide from an alkene. So the product would have an epoxide ring, but also any substituents from the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene was adjacent to a carbonyl group, then the product would have that carbonyl plus the epoxide.

Wait, this makes sense. So the starting material X is an alkene with a carbonyl group nearby. Then, when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Wait, oxirane is the epoxide. So if X is this, then reacting with the reagent would make the epoxide? Or is this the product?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is the epoxide. So if X is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide, then X would be the alkene form. So let's look at each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached. But that's the product, right? Because the reaction forms the epoxide. So X would be the alkene version. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe let's think about the reaction. The starting material is an alkene, which is epoxidized to form the epoxide. So the product is the epoxide, and the structure of the product is what gives the NMR data. So the question is, what was the starting alkene (X) that, when epoxidized, gives the product with the given NMR spectra.

Wait, but the options are for compound X. So the options are the possible starting materials, which are alkenes. So after epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring.

But in the NMR data, the product has a peak at 197.7 ppm in the 13C, which is a carbonyl. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond because epoxidation would add the oxygen and leave the carbonyl intact.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which of them have a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Wait, oxirane is the epoxide. So if X is this, then it's already an epoxide? That can't be, because the reaction produces the epoxide. So X must be the alkene, so option A is probably the product, not the starting material.

Option B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Again, oxirane is the epoxide, so this is the product. So the starting material would have a double bond where the epoxide is. Hmm, but this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the product's structure.

The product has a carbonyl group. So the epoxide must be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon. So the structure would be something like O-C-O in a three-membered ring, attached to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps each is attached to a carbonyl or something that doesn't split their signals.

In the 13C NMR, 21.3 and 28.4 are two different carbons, so two different methyl groups. Maybe one is a CH3 attached to a carbonyl (like a ketone) and another is a CH3 attached to another part.

Wait, but the 13C has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the structure has a ketone and an epoxide.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide adjacent to a ketone, then the structure would be something like a cyclopropane ring (but O in it) attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with oxygen and a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted epoxide with a ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple epoxide with a substituent that includes a ketone.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the integration of the 1H NMR. There's 3H, 3H, 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So total of 3+3+1+2+1+2=12 H. But the product's formula isn't given. Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, so the product would have the same formula? Because epoxidation doesn't change the number of carbons or hydrogens, except for adding an oxygen. Wait, wait. The starting material is C11H12O. Epoxidation adds an oxygen as the epoxide, so the product would be C11H10O2? Because the reaction of an alkene (C=C) with O adds an oxygen.

Wait, but the given NMR is for the product, which has a formula that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C11H12O. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because epoxidation adds an oxygen atom. So maybe the product is C11H10O2.

But the options for X are all C11H12O. So when X is epoxidized, it adds an oxygen, making the product C11H10O2.

But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which would be O. So maybe the starting material has a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product is a bicyclic structure with an epoxide and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a substituted epoxide where the substituents are a benzene ring and a ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the NMR data with the possible structures.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 197.7 ppm: Definitely a carbonyl, probably a ketone.

So the product has a ketone group. So the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond.

So the structure of X would be something like a ketone next to an alkene. When the alkene is epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring adjacent to the ketone.

So, perhaps the structure looks like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-O-ring?

Wait, no. Let me think. The epoxidation would take the double bond and form an epoxide. So if the starting material has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, perhaps more like R-CO-CH2-CH2- with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like (CH3)2C-O-CR2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclopropane derivative, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the 1H NMR of the product. The aromatic signals are:

- 6.75 (d, 1H)
- 7.08 (d, 2H)
- 7.68 (d, 1H)
- 7.71 (d, 2H)

These could correspond to a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring. Or perhaps a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that causes the specific splitting.

Wait, but the doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a styrene-derived structure.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are from a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond.

Let me think about how the coupling might work. For example, in a trans-stilbene derivative, the coupling could lead to certain patterns.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group as well, so perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted epoxide adjacent to a ketone.

Wait, another idea. The product's 13C has a singlet at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone epoxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options can help. Let's read each option structure.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the structure is an oxirane (epoxide) connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is C6H4-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is C6H4-CH=CH2. So 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a CH2CH2- group at position 4, but with a methyl substituent. Wait, no. Styryl is vinyl attached to benzene. So 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at the para position, and a methyl group somewhere. Wait, no, if it's 4-methylstyryl, then the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 at the para position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at the para position and a methyl group on the benzene. No, that can't be right. Or maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a vinyl group and a methyl substituent on the same carbon. Hmm.

But if X is this structure, then it's an epoxide, so the product after epoxidation would be... wait, but X is the starting material, so maybe it's the alkene. So if X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, then it's the epoxide, which doesn't make sense because the reaction is forming the epoxide. So X must be the alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think: the starting material is an alkene, which upon epoxidation becomes the epoxide. So the product would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring where the double bond was.

Looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure would be oxirane (epoxide) connected to a propenyl group, which is substituted with a phenyl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the structure would be an epoxide connected to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, but that's the product. So X would be the alkene version, which would have a double bond. So X would be 2-(1-phenylpropenyl)oxirane? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like (Ph)CH2-CH2-CH2-O-epoxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is something else.

Another approach: Let's count the number of signals. The 1H NMR has six signals, which suggest a symmetrical structure or certain substituents. The 13C NMR has 9 signals, which suggests some equivalent carbons.

In the 13C, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. So perhaps one is a methyl attached to a carbonyl and the other is a methyl attached elsewhere.

Wait, but in the product, the 13C shows a carbonyl, so the starting material must have had a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. So when the epoxidation occurs, the carbonyl remains.

So the structure of X would be an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl group.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, looking at the 1H NMR of the product, the two singlet methyl groups are probably attached to a carbonyl or something else that doesn't split their signals.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two methyl carbons: 21.3 and 28.4. The 21.3 is likely a methyl attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. The 28.4 might be a methyl attached to another group, perhaps a CH2.

So the product might have a structure like (CH3)CO-CH2-O-epoxide? Not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the epoxide is attached to a carbonyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the starting material would be the alkene, which when epoxidized forms the product.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl group. So Option D as the product would not have a carbonyl, so that's not matching.

Wait, but in that case, the starting material would be styrene, which is an alkene. So the product after epoxidation would be styrene oxide, which is an epoxide without a carbonyl. But the product here has a carbonyl, so D can't be correct.

So perhaps the correct product has a carbonyl group, so the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure would be an epoxide attached to a propenyl group which is connected to a phenyl. So perhaps the starting material is the same structure but with a double bond. Wait, no, that's the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkene with a carbonyl group. For example, something like (Ph)C=CH-CO-something. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The 13C NMR has a peak at 144.1, which is a high value, typical for a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon. But 144 is more in the range of an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a tricyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted epoxide where the substituents are a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the number of aromatic signals.

In the 1H NMR of the product, the aromatic region has four signals: 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). That makes a total of 6 aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring is probably a para-substituted ring with two substituents causing the splitting.

Wait, para substitution with two groups that each have two protons. Or maybe it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring.

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing a splitting pattern.

Wait, but the product's aromatic protons in the NMR seem to add up to 6H, which is a benzene ring with two substituents each having two H. For para substitution, that would make sense.

So perhaps the product has a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, each of which is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should consider the coupling patterns.

The aromatic protons are:

6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

Looking at the chemical shifts, 6.75 is lower field than 7.08, which is lower than 7.68, which is lower than 7.71. So perhaps the protons are in different environments.

In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like two methoxy groups, the protons would be ortho and para to the substituents. But in this case, the substituents might be different.

Wait, another approach: The downfield shifts (higher ppm) are around 7.7, which is typical for protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, causing the ortho protons to be more deshielded (higher ppm). So, if there's a substituent like a ketone (COCH3) attached to the benzene, the ortho protons would be around 7.7 ppm.

Wait, but in the product's 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative with an epoxide.

Hmm. So, the structure could be something like:

O
||
C-O-(epoxide ring)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps one is attached to a carbonyl (like a ketone) and the other is attached to something else, like a CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide.

So, if the product is an epoxide adjacent to a ketone, which is attached to a methyl group, and another methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, for example, maybe the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-O-(epoxide ring). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D) 2-styrylepoxide, but that doesn't fit because the product has a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's structure and see which one, when epoxidized, would give the NMR data described.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: oxirane connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a benzene with a vinyl group. 4-methyl means a methyl at the para position. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at one position and a methyl at the para position. Then, the oxirane (epoxide) is connected to the CH2 of the vinyl. So, when X is this, but wait, that would be the product, because X is the starting material and the product is the epoxide.

Wait, no. X is the starting material, which is the alkene. So if X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, that would mean X is already an epoxide, which can't be, because the reaction forms the epoxide. So this suggests that option A is not the starting material.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: oxirane connected to a propenyl group which is connected to a phenyl. So the propenyl group is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. The oxirane is at position 2, which would be the middle carbon of the propenyl group. So the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, but that would be the product. So the starting material would have a double bond between the middle and the next carbon. So X would have a double bond in the propenyl group. So the starting material would be 2-(1-phenylpropenyl)oxirane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the propenyl has a double bond. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide in that double bond.

But I'm getting a bit lost.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: oxirane with substituents at positions 2 (methyl) and 3 (styryl). So the starting material would have a double bond in the styryl group, and upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide in that position.

But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which would suggest that the starting material had a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not certain.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide connected to a styryl group. So the starting material would be styrene, which when epoxidized gives styrene oxide, which is 2-styrylepoxide. But the product in this case has a carbonyl, which styrene oxide doesn't have. So option D's product doesn't match the NMR, so it's probably not the correct answer.

Wait, but the product's NMR has a carbonyl. So the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. So perhaps the starting material is a vinyl ketone.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph. Then, upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring and a ketone.

So, the product would be (CH3)2C-O-CH2-Ph with an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, but let's look at the 13C NMR again. The product has a 197.7 ppm, which is the carbonyl. So the structure must have a ketone.

So the starting material would be an allyl ketone, perhaps.

But looking back at the options, which ones have a ketone?

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure would be Oxirane connected to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, attached at position 2. So the structure would be CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the oxirane at position 2. But that doesn't have a carbonyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the structure would be an oxirane with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the starting material would have a double bond in the styryl group, and upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring. But where would the carbonyl come from? The starting material doesn't have a carbonyl; so the product shouldn't have a carbonyl either. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the product's NMR has a carbonyl. So the starting material must have had a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

Hmm, considering all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C or B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR data again. The carbons:

21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s). These are likely two different methyl groups. One is a carbonyl methyl (like (CH3)CO-) and the other is perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH2.

The aromatic carbons are around 126-144, which makes sense. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to the epoxide oxygen or the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The epoxide ring would have two carbons, each attached to oxygen. These carbons typically appear in the 50-70 ppm range in 13C NMR. But in the given data, there are no carbons in that range. Instead, the highest is 144.1, which is more in line with aromatic carbons or carbons attached to oxygen in a benzene ring.

So perhaps the epoxide is not present, and the product is something else. Wait, but the question states that the product is formed by epoxidation. So the product must have an epoxide ring, but the 13C NMR doesn't show the typical epoxide carbons. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger ring, making the carbons appear at higher ppm. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a different type of oxide. But the question says it's an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide carbons are part of a conjugated system, shifting their chemical shifts upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is such that the epoxide carbons are not directly attached to the carbonyl but are part of a benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the integration of the 1H NMR. The two doublets at 7.08 (2H) and 7.71 (2H) are likely a pair of protons each. The 6.75 and 7.68 (each 1H) are likely trans or cis protons in the aromatic ring.

This might suggest a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the splitting. For example, two substituents on the benzene ring at para positions, each causing a doublet in the NMR.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the product would be something like benzene with a vinyl group that's epoxidized. But in that case, the product wouldn't have a carbonyl group, which contradicts the NMR data. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide attached to a propenyl group which is connected to a benzene ring. So the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. So the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2 group. Wait, but that doesn't have a carbonyl group either.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the 13C NMR again. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

So perhaps the starting material is an allyl ketone, like (E)- or (Z)-something.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph-OH? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-Ph, but that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond somewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is something like (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide between those two CH2 groups and retain the ketone group.

But how does that fit the NMR data?

The 1H NMR would then have the two methyl groups from the ketone, perhaps as singlets. The aromatic protons would be from the benzene ring, which is para-substituted.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: Let's think about the number of signals. The 1H NMR has six signals, which suggests that the structure has some symmetry but also several unique environments.

The two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR might correspond to two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2C=O as part of the molecule.

But the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which would be the carbonyl. So the product would have (CH3)2CO as part of its structure.

Wait, but how does that fit with the rest?

So, the product is an epoxide with a ketone group. So the epoxide is probably part of a larger structure adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-(epoxide ring)-Ph.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should try to associate each option's structure with the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The structure would be an oxirane connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. So the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 at the para position. So the structure is a benzene ring with a CH2=CH- group at one position and a methyl at the para position. The oxirane is connected to the CH2 of the vinyl group. So the product would have that structure. But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So option A can't be correct.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure is an epoxide connected to a propenyl group that's attached to a benzene. So the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. The epoxide is at the end. So the structure would be CH2-O-(epoxide)-CH(Ph)-CH2. But this structure doesn't have a carbonyl group, so the NMR data doesn't fit.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure is an oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the styryl group is CH2=CH-Ph attached to position 3. The product would have an epoxide ring, but without a carbonyl. So the NMR data with a carbonyl doesn't fit, so option C can't be correct.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide connected to a styryl group. So, the product has a vinyl benzene connected to the epoxide. But again, no carbonyl, so the NMR doesn't match.

Wait, but all the options don't have a carbonyl except perhaps option B if the propenyl group is part of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think about option B again: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure would be an oxirane (epoxide) connected to a propenyl group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the phenyl is attached to C2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-(CH2-C(Ph)=CH2)

Wait, no, the oxirane is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be a ring with two CH2 groups and one O. The substituent is at the 2 position, which is one of the CH2 groups. So the substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, attached at position 2. So the substituent is CH2-CH(Ph)=CH2 attached to the epoxide ring. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

So the epoxide ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(Ph)=CH2 group. But where is the carbonyl group in this structure?

Ah, wait! Maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond. So the starting material would be a vinyl ketone, like (Ph)C=CH-CO-R. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B's structure doesn't include a carbonyl. So perhaps the correct option is not among the given choices, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reagent. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I think this is used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which uses a peracid. Wait, but in the Prilezhaev oxidation, the peracid is generated in situ. So the reaction conditions are acidic, and the reagent is a base to deprotonate the peracid.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is more specific. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation of an allyl ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Let me try to imagine the product's structure. If X is option C, then upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring. But where would the carbonyl come from? It wouldn't, unless X had a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O, which upon epoxidation would be C11H10O2. The product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl (197.7 ppm), so the product has a ketone or another carbonyl group.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps one is a methyl attached to a carbonyl and another is a methyl attached to another part of the molecule.

The 13C NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7, so the product has a ketone group. Therefore, the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond.

Looking back at the options, none of the options explicitly have a ketone, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structures.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. When epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring. But wait, the starting material is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide. So the product would have the epoxide ring and any substituents from the starting material, including a ketone if present.

Wait, but none of the options have a ketone, so I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different structure altogether. Maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: The 1H NMR has a triplet at 2.28 and 2.31, both singlets. Maybe these are two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl, like (CH3)2CO.

So the product has a (CH3)2CO group and an epoxide ring.

If the product is (CH3)2CO connected to an epoxide, which is connected to a benzene ring, that would fit the NMR data.

So, the structure would be something like (CH3)2C=O-O-epoxide-Ph.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the product would have an epoxide ring, a methyl group, and a styryl group. But where is the carbonyl?

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess based on the data. The product has a carbonyl, so the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. Among the options, option B is the only one with a propenyl group, which could have a carbonyl if it's a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the starting material is that, but wait, no. The starting material would be the alkene, which would have a double bond. So option B's structure is the product, which would have an epoxide. But the product has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So I'm back to square one.

I think I'll have to go with option C, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The reaction is an epoxidation, where an alkene in X is converted into an epoxide in the product. The product's 1H and 13C NMR data reveal key features, including a carbonyl group at 197.7 ppm in the 13C NMR, indicating that the starting material must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond.

### Key Analysis of the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlet methyl groups, likely attached to electronegative groups like carbonyls.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with additional substituents causing splitting.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl group, likely a ketone.
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two distinct methyl groups.
   - Aromatic carbons in the range of δ 126.9–144.1 ppm, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.

The presence of a carbonyl group in the product indicates that the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond. The reaction converts the double bond into an epoxide while retaining the carbonyl group.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
  This structure does not include a carbonyl group, which contradicts the 13C NMR data showing a peak at 197.7 ppm. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
  This structure includes a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. However, it does not have a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the product's NMR data. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

- **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
  This structure includes a styryl group (vinyl benzene) and a methyl group. However, it does not have a carbonyl group, which is required based on the NMR data. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
  This structure is an epoxide derived from styrene. However, it does not include a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the 13C NMR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that none of the options perfectly match the NMR data, as all lack the carbonyl group observed in the product. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane** is the most plausible choice, despite the mismatch with the carbonyl data.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I'm supposed to figure out what compound X was, choosing from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Wait, no, wait. Sharpless epoxidation uses a different catalyst, but this reagent is a base or maybe an acid scavenger. Oh, right, wait! Actually, this reagent is often used in the epoxidation of alkenes, specifically in the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Or wait, maybe it's part of the conditions for epoxide formation using peracids. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, right! I think this reagent is used in the epoxidation of alkenes via the Prilezhaev oxidation. The reaction is typically done with a peracid, and 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is used as a base to deprotonate the peracid, making it a better oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the product here is an epoxide, right? Because the options all have 'oxirane' or 'epoxide' in their names. So the reaction is epoxidizing an alkene.

So, the starting material, compound X, is an alkene that upon reaction forms an epoxide. So the product is the epoxide, and we need to find out what the starting alkene was.

Looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's analyze the 1H and 13C NMR.

First, the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring? Or perhaps part of an epoxide? Hmm, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, but maybe here it's something else.
- δ2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same integration. So two singlet methyl groups. Wait, but integration is 3H each. So two different methyl groups, each as singlets. So maybe two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Like maybe attached to carbonyls, or perhaps in a ring.
Wait, but the product is an epoxide, which is an oxygen-containing ring. So perhaps the starting material was an alkene with substituents that lead to an epoxide with these substituents.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- δ6.75 (1H, d): A doublet. So maybe a coupling with one proton.
- δ7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Could be adjacent to each other in an aromatic ring.
- δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.
- δ7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about how the aromatic signals could correspond. Maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a styrene structure, like a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but the product's NMR is for the epoxide, right? So the epoxide would have the oxygen in a three-membered ring, and the other parts would be substituents.

Wait, but the starting material is an alkene, which after epoxidation becomes an epoxide. So the product's structure would have an epoxide group connected to some substituents.

Let me try to draw this. The product would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring, with two adjacent carbons, each connected to other substituents.

But looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals suggest that the substituents are perhaps in a particular arrangement. Let me think of the coupling patterns.

The aromatic protons: 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). So maybe there are two sets of doublets. Perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but not para. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans or cis arrangement.

Wait, considering the coupling, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. But how would that fit with the doublets? Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a benzene, making a styrene.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the 13C NMR.

13C NMR data:
- 21.3 (1C, s): Very low shift, maybe a methyl attached to something. Like a CH3 in a CH2 group, or maybe a CH3 attached to oxygen? Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are attached to a carbonyl, like ketone.

Wait, but in the product, which is the epoxide, the carbons would be from the epoxide ring and any substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 and 28.4: These are two single carbons, each as singlets. 21 ppm is typically a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, perhaps. 28.4 is a bit higher, maybe a CH2 or another CH3 attached to something else.

The rest of the carbons are around 126-144 ppm, which is in the aromatic region. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. Wait, but the product is an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So that's confusing. Wait, unless the starting material had a carbonyl and the reaction didn't affect it.

Wait, the starting material is compound X, which is being epoxidized. So the product would have the epoxide group, but other functional groups from X would remain.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7 ppm. That's a very high chemical shift, typically for a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. So the product has a carbonyl group. Hmm, but the reaction is an epoxidation, which typically uses peracids and forms an epoxide from an alkene. So the product would have an epoxide ring, but also any substituents from the starting alkene. So if the starting alkene was adjacent to a carbonyl group, then the product would have that carbonyl plus the epoxide.

Wait, this makes sense. So the starting material X is an alkene with a carbonyl group nearby. Then, when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring and a carbonyl.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Wait, oxirane is the epoxide. So if X is this, then reacting with the reagent would make the epoxide? Or is this the product?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is the epoxide. So if X is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide, then X would be the alkene form. So let's look at each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group (vinyl benzene) attached. But that's the product, right? Because the reaction forms the epoxide. So X would be the alkene version. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe let's think about the reaction. The starting material is an alkene, which is epoxidized to form the epoxide. So the product is the epoxide, and the structure of the product is what gives the NMR data. So the question is, what was the starting alkene (X) that, when epoxidized, gives the product with the given NMR spectra.

Wait, but the options are for compound X. So the options are the possible starting materials, which are alkenes. So after epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring.

But in the NMR data, the product has a peak at 197.7 ppm in the 13C, which is a carbonyl. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond because epoxidation would add the oxygen and leave the carbonyl intact.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which of them have a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: Wait, oxirane is the epoxide. So if X is this, then it's already an epoxide? That can't be, because the reaction produces the epoxide. So X must be the alkene, so option A is probably the product, not the starting material.

Option B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Again, oxirane is the epoxide, so this is the product. So the starting material would have a double bond where the epoxide is. Hmm, but this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the product's structure.

The product has a carbonyl group. So the epoxide must be adjacent to a carbonyl carbon. So the structure would be something like O-C-O in a three-membered ring, attached to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps each is attached to a carbonyl or something that doesn't split their signals.

In the 13C NMR, 21.3 and 28.4 are two different carbons, so two different methyl groups. Maybe one is a CH3 attached to a carbonyl (like a ketone) and another is a CH3 attached to another part.

Wait, but the 13C has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the structure has a ketone and an epoxide.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide adjacent to a ketone, then the structure would be something like a cyclopropane ring (but O in it) attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with oxygen and a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted epoxide with a ketone substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple epoxide with a substituent that includes a ketone.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the integration of the 1H NMR. There's 3H, 3H, 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So total of 3+3+1+2+1+2=12 H. But the product's formula isn't given. Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, so the product would have the same formula? Because epoxidation doesn't change the number of carbons or hydrogens, except for adding an oxygen. Wait, wait. The starting material is C11H12O. Epoxidation adds an oxygen as the epoxide, so the product would be C11H10O2? Because the reaction of an alkene (C=C) with O adds an oxygen.

Wait, but the given NMR is for the product, which has a formula that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C11H12O. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because epoxidation adds an oxygen atom. So maybe the product is C11H10O2.

But the options for X are all C11H12O. So when X is epoxidized, it adds an oxygen, making the product C11H10O2.

But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which would be O. So maybe the starting material has a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product is a bicyclic structure with an epoxide and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a substituted epoxide where the substituents are a benzene ring and a ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the NMR data with the possible structures.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 197.7 ppm: Definitely a carbonyl, probably a ketone.

So the product has a ketone group. So the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond.

So the structure of X would be something like a ketone next to an alkene. When the alkene is epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring adjacent to the ketone.

So, perhaps the structure looks like:

R-CO-CH2-CH2-O-ring?

Wait, no. Let me think. The epoxidation would take the double bond and form an epoxide. So if the starting material has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... no, perhaps more like R-CO-CH2-CH2- with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like (CH3)2C-O-CR2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclopropane derivative, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the 1H NMR of the product. The aromatic signals are:

- 6.75 (d, 1H)
- 7.08 (d, 2H)
- 7.68 (d, 1H)
- 7.71 (d, 2H)

These could correspond to a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring. Or perhaps a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that causes the specific splitting.

Wait, but the doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a styrene-derived structure.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic protons are from a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond.

Let me think about how the coupling might work. For example, in a trans-stilbene derivative, the coupling could lead to certain patterns.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group as well, so perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted epoxide adjacent to a ketone.

Wait, another idea. The product's 13C has a singlet at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a cyclic ketone epoxide. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options can help. Let's read each option structure.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the structure is an oxirane (epoxide) connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is C6H4-CH2-CH2-? No, styryl is C6H4-CH=CH2. So 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a CH2CH2- group at position 4, but with a methyl substituent. Wait, no. Styryl is vinyl attached to benzene. So 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at the para position, and a methyl group somewhere. Wait, no, if it's 4-methylstyryl, then the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 at the para position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at the para position and a methyl group on the benzene. No, that can't be right. Or maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a vinyl group and a methyl substituent on the same carbon. Hmm.

But if X is this structure, then it's an epoxide, so the product after epoxidation would be... wait, but X is the starting material, so maybe it's the alkene. So if X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, then it's the epoxide, which doesn't make sense because the reaction is forming the epoxide. So X must be the alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think: the starting material is an alkene, which upon epoxidation becomes the epoxide. So the product would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring where the double bond was.

Looking at option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure would be oxirane (epoxide) connected to a propenyl group, which is substituted with a phenyl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the structure would be an epoxide connected to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, but that's the product. So X would be the alkene version, which would have a double bond. So X would be 2-(1-phenylpropenyl)oxirane? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like (Ph)CH2-CH2-CH2-O-epoxide? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is something else.

Another approach: Let's count the number of signals. The 1H NMR has six signals, which suggest a symmetrical structure or certain substituents. The 13C NMR has 9 signals, which suggests some equivalent carbons.

In the 13C, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. So perhaps one is a methyl attached to a carbonyl and the other is a methyl attached elsewhere.

Wait, but in the product, the 13C shows a carbonyl, so the starting material must have had a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. So when the epoxidation occurs, the carbonyl remains.

So the structure of X would be an alkene adjacent to a carbonyl group.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a cyclohexene derivative with a ketone. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, looking at the 1H NMR of the product, the two singlet methyl groups are probably attached to a carbonyl or something else that doesn't split their signals.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two methyl carbons: 21.3 and 28.4. The 21.3 is likely a methyl attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. The 28.4 might be a methyl attached to another group, perhaps a CH2.

So the product might have a structure like (CH3)CO-CH2-O-epoxide? Not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where the epoxide is attached to a carbonyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. The structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the starting material would be the alkene, which when epoxidized forms the product.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl group. So Option D as the product would not have a carbonyl, so that's not matching.

Wait, but in that case, the starting material would be styrene, which is an alkene. So the product after epoxidation would be styrene oxide, which is an epoxide without a carbonyl. But the product here has a carbonyl, so D can't be correct.

So perhaps the correct product has a carbonyl group, so the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure would be an epoxide attached to a propenyl group which is connected to a phenyl. So perhaps the starting material is the same structure but with a double bond. Wait, no, that's the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkene with a carbonyl group. For example, something like (Ph)C=CH-CO-something. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The 13C NMR has a peak at 144.1, which is a high value, typical for a carbonyl or an aromatic carbon. But 144 is more in the range of an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide or an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a tricyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted epoxide where the substituents are a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the number of aromatic signals.

In the 1H NMR of the product, the aromatic region has four signals: 1H (d), 2H (d), 1H (d), 2H (d). That makes a total of 6 aromatic protons. So the aromatic ring is probably a para-substituted ring with two substituents causing the splitting.

Wait, para substitution with two groups that each have two protons. Or maybe it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring.

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents, each causing a splitting pattern.

Wait, but the product's aromatic protons in the NMR seem to add up to 6H, which is a benzene ring with two substituents each having two H. For para substitution, that would make sense.

So perhaps the product has a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, each of which is an ethyl group or something else.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should consider the coupling patterns.

The aromatic protons are:

6.75 (1H, d)
7.08 (2H, d)
7.68 (1H, d)
7.71 (2H, d)

Looking at the chemical shifts, 6.75 is lower field than 7.08, which is lower than 7.68, which is lower than 7.71. So perhaps the protons are in different environments.

In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like two methoxy groups, the protons would be ortho and para to the substituents. But in this case, the substituents might be different.

Wait, another approach: The downfield shifts (higher ppm) are around 7.7, which is typical for protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, causing the ortho protons to be more deshielded (higher ppm). So, if there's a substituent like a ketone (COCH3) attached to the benzene, the ortho protons would be around 7.7 ppm.

Wait, but in the product's 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative with an epoxide.

Hmm. So, the structure could be something like:

O
||
C-O-(epoxide ring)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another thought. The product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps one is attached to a carbonyl (like a ketone) and the other is attached to something else, like a CH2 group adjacent to the epoxide.

So, if the product is an epoxide adjacent to a ketone, which is attached to a methyl group, and another methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, for example, maybe the structure is (CH3)CO-CH2-O-(epoxide ring). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D) 2-styrylepoxide, but that doesn't fit because the product has a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's structure and see which one, when epoxidized, would give the NMR data described.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: oxirane connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a benzene with a vinyl group. 4-methyl means a methyl at the para position. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at one position and a methyl at the para position. Then, the oxirane (epoxide) is connected to the CH2 of the vinyl. So, when X is this, but wait, that would be the product, because X is the starting material and the product is the epoxide.

Wait, no. X is the starting material, which is the alkene. So if X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, that would mean X is already an epoxide, which can't be, because the reaction forms the epoxide. So this suggests that option A is not the starting material.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Structure: oxirane connected to a propenyl group which is connected to a phenyl. So the propenyl group is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. The oxirane is at position 2, which would be the middle carbon of the propenyl group. So the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, but that would be the product. So the starting material would have a double bond between the middle and the next carbon. So X would have a double bond in the propenyl group. So the starting material would be 2-(1-phenylpropenyl)oxirane, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the propenyl has a double bond. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide in that double bond.

But I'm getting a bit lost.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Structure: oxirane with substituents at positions 2 (methyl) and 3 (styryl). So the starting material would have a double bond in the styryl group, and upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide in that position.

But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which would suggest that the starting material had a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not certain.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide connected to a styryl group. So the starting material would be styrene, which when epoxidized gives styrene oxide, which is 2-styrylepoxide. But the product in this case has a carbonyl, which styrene oxide doesn't have. So option D's product doesn't match the NMR, so it's probably not the correct answer.

Wait, but the product's NMR has a carbonyl. So the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. So perhaps the starting material is a vinyl ketone.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph. Then, upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring and a ketone.

So, the product would be (CH3)2C-O-CH2-Ph with an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, but let's look at the 13C NMR again. The product has a 197.7 ppm, which is the carbonyl. So the structure must have a ketone.

So the starting material would be an allyl ketone, perhaps.

But looking back at the options, which ones have a ketone?

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure would be Oxirane connected to a CH2-C(Ph)=CH2 group. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, attached at position 2. So the structure would be CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the oxirane at position 2. But that doesn't have a carbonyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the structure would be an oxirane with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the starting material would have a double bond in the styryl group, and upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring. But where would the carbonyl come from? The starting material doesn't have a carbonyl; so the product shouldn't have a carbonyl either. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the product's NMR has a carbonyl. So the starting material must have had a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

Hmm, considering all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C or B. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the 13C NMR data again. The carbons:

21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s). These are likely two different methyl groups. One is a carbonyl methyl (like (CH3)CO-) and the other is perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH2.

The aromatic carbons are around 126-144, which makes sense. The 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to the epoxide oxygen or the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: The epoxide ring would have two carbons, each attached to oxygen. These carbons typically appear in the 50-70 ppm range in 13C NMR. But in the given data, there are no carbons in that range. Instead, the highest is 144.1, which is more in line with aromatic carbons or carbons attached to oxygen in a benzene ring.

So perhaps the epoxide is not present, and the product is something else. Wait, but the question states that the product is formed by epoxidation. So the product must have an epoxide ring, but the 13C NMR doesn't show the typical epoxide carbons. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a larger ring, making the carbons appear at higher ppm. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not an epoxide but a different type of oxide. But the question says it's an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide carbons are part of a conjugated system, shifting their chemical shifts upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is such that the epoxide carbons are not directly attached to the carbonyl but are part of a benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an epoxide substituent and a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the integration of the 1H NMR. The two doublets at 7.08 (2H) and 7.71 (2H) are likely a pair of protons each. The 6.75 and 7.68 (each 1H) are likely trans or cis protons in the aromatic ring.

This might suggest a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause the splitting. For example, two substituents on the benzene ring at para positions, each causing a doublet in the NMR.

Wait, but I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene). So the product would be something like benzene with a vinyl group that's epoxidized. But in that case, the product wouldn't have a carbonyl group, which contradicts the NMR data. So option D is likely incorrect.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide attached to a propenyl group which is connected to a benzene ring. So the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. So the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2 group. Wait, but that doesn't have a carbonyl group either.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the 13C NMR again. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. So the product has a carbonyl group. So the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond.

So perhaps the starting material is an allyl ketone, like (E)- or (Z)-something.

For example, something like (CH3)2C=CH-Ph-OH? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-Ph, but that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-Ph? No, that's a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph with a double bond somewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is something like (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide between those two CH2 groups and retain the ketone group.

But how does that fit the NMR data?

The 1H NMR would then have the two methyl groups from the ketone, perhaps as singlets. The aromatic protons would be from the benzene ring, which is para-substituted.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: Let's think about the number of signals. The 1H NMR has six signals, which suggests that the structure has some symmetry but also several unique environments.

The two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR might correspond to two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2C=O as part of the molecule.

But the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which would be the carbonyl. So the product would have (CH3)2CO as part of its structure.

Wait, but how does that fit with the rest?

So, the product is an epoxide with a ketone group. So the epoxide is probably part of a larger structure adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-(epoxide ring)-Ph.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should try to associate each option's structure with the NMR data.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The structure would be an oxirane connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. So the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-CH3 at the para position. So the structure is a benzene ring with a CH2=CH- group at one position and a methyl at the para position. The oxirane is connected to the CH2 of the vinyl group. So the product would have that structure. But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So option A can't be correct.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. The structure is an epoxide connected to a propenyl group that's attached to a benzene. So the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the middle carbon. The epoxide is at the end. So the structure would be CH2-O-(epoxide)-CH(Ph)-CH2. But this structure doesn't have a carbonyl group, so the NMR data doesn't fit.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The structure is an oxirane with a methyl at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. So the styryl group is CH2=CH-Ph attached to position 3. The product would have an epoxide ring, but without a carbonyl. So the NMR data with a carbonyl doesn't fit, so option C can't be correct.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide connected to a styryl group. So, the product has a vinyl benzene connected to the epoxide. But again, no carbonyl, so the NMR doesn't match.

Wait, but all the options don't have a carbonyl except perhaps option B if the propenyl group is part of a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think about option B again: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

So, the structure would be an oxirane (epoxide) connected to a propenyl group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the phenyl is attached to C2. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-(CH2-C(Ph)=CH2)

Wait, no, the oxirane is a three-membered ring. So the structure would be a ring with two CH2 groups and one O. The substituent is at the 2 position, which is one of the CH2 groups. So the substituent is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, attached at position 2. So the substituent is CH2-CH(Ph)=CH2 attached to the epoxide ring. So the structure would be:

O
||
C-O-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2

So the epoxide ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(Ph)=CH2 group. But where is the carbonyl group in this structure?

Ah, wait! Maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond. So the starting material would be a vinyl ketone, like (Ph)C=CH-CO-R. So when epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B's structure doesn't include a carbonyl. So perhaps the correct option is not among the given choices, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reagent. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I think this is used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which uses a peracid. Wait, but in the Prilezhaev oxidation, the peracid is generated in situ. So the reaction conditions are acidic, and the reagent is a base to deprotonate the peracid.

Wait, but maybe the reaction is more specific. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation of an allyl ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. Let me try to imagine the product's structure. If X is option C, then upon epoxidation, the product would have an epoxide ring. But where would the carbonyl come from? It wouldn't, unless X had a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O, which upon epoxidation would be C11H10O2. The product's 13C NMR has a carbonyl (197.7 ppm), so the product has a ketone or another carbonyl group.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps one is a methyl attached to a carbonyl and another is a methyl attached to another part of the molecule.

The 13C NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7, so the product has a ketone group. Therefore, the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond.

Looking back at the options, none of the options explicitly have a ketone, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structures.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. When epoxidized, the product would have an epoxide ring. But wait, the starting material is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide. So the product would have the epoxide ring and any substituents from the starting material, including a ketone if present.

Wait, but none of the options have a ketone, so I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different structure altogether. Maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: The 1H NMR has a triplet at 2.28 and 2.31, both singlets. Maybe these are two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl, like (CH3)2CO.

So the product has a (CH3)2CO group and an epoxide ring.

If the product is (CH3)2CO connected to an epoxide, which is connected to a benzene ring, that would fit the NMR data.

So, the structure would be something like (CH3)2C=O-O-epoxide-Ph.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C-O-CH2-CH2-Ph, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the product would have an epoxide ring, a methyl group, and a styryl group. But where is the carbonyl?

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess based on the data. The product has a carbonyl, so the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to the double bond. Among the options, option B is the only one with a propenyl group, which could have a carbonyl if it's a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the starting material is that, but wait, no. The starting material would be the alkene, which would have a double bond. So option B's structure is the product, which would have an epoxide. But the product has a carbonyl, which this structure doesn't have. So I'm back to square one.

I think I'll have to go with option C, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves identifying Compound X (C11H12O) based on the NMR data of the product formed after reacting X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The reaction is an epoxidation, where an alkene in X is converted into an epoxide in the product. The product's 1H and 13C NMR data reveal key features, including a carbonyl group at 197.7 ppm in the 13C NMR, indicating that the starting material must have a carbonyl group adjacent to the double bond.

### Key Analysis of the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlet methyl groups, likely attached to electronegative groups like carbonyls.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with additional substituents causing splitting.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl group, likely a ketone.
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two distinct methyl groups.
   - Aromatic carbons in the range of δ 126.9–144.1 ppm, consistent with a substituted benzene ring.

The presence of a carbonyl group in the product indicates that the starting material must have a ketone adjacent to the double bond. The reaction converts the double bond into an epoxide while retaining the carbonyl group.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
  This structure does not include a carbonyl group, which contradicts the 13C NMR data showing a peak at 197.7 ppm. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
  This structure includes a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring. However, it does not have a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the product's NMR data. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

- **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
  This structure includes a styryl group (vinyl benzene) and a methyl group. However, it does not have a carbonyl group, which is required based on the NMR data. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
  This structure is an epoxide derived from styrene. However, it does not include a carbonyl group, which is inconsistent with the 13C NMR data. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that none of the options perfectly match the NMR data, as all lack the carbonyl group observed in the product. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane** is the most plausible choice, despite the mismatch with the carbonyl data.

Answer: C
