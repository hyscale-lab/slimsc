Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which means it's a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions because it depends on r squared, and since r is the radial distance, it's symmetric in all directions.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the principal quantum number n, which is related to the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions (x, y, z). But wait, in three dimensions, especially in spherical coordinates, it's often described using the quantum numbers n_r and l, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

But wait, no, for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, another approach is to think in terms of the total energy, which combines all three dimensions. The energy levels are given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, I think that's when each dimension contributes n_x + n_y + n_z = n, but actually, the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh, right. So each of the three dimensions contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, but when you sum them, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, another way to think about it is that the energy levels are E = ħω (N + 3/2), where N is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So N can be 0,1,2,... Each N corresponds to a certain energy level. The degeneracy of each level depends on how many ways you can get N by adding n_x, n_y, n_z.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is often described with a different approach. Another way to think is that the energy levels are E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer. So each n corresponds to a certain energy. But wait, in 3D, for each n, there's a certain number of states with the same n but different angular momentum quantum numbers l, etc.

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with the hydrogen atom. Let me think again. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction has a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, and the total N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So for each N, the energy level is the same for all states with that N.

The number of possible states (eigenfunctions) for a given N is the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers, n_x, n_y, n_z, which is (N+2 choose 2), or (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for each N, the degeneracy is (N+1)(N+2)/2.

Wait, wait, let me think. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 3 -1) choose (3 -1) ) = (N+2 choose 2) ), which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. So yeah, that's the degeneracy, the number of states for each N.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is N=0, since the lowest energy is when each direction is at its lowest state. So the first excited state would be N=1, second N=2, third N=3.

Wait, no. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state is the next higher energy, which is N=1. The second excited state is N=2, third is N=3.

So the third excited state is N=3. So the energy is E = ħω (3 + 3/2) = ħω (9/2) = (9/2) ħω.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again. The formula is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So for N=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's correct.

Now, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for this energy is the degeneracy, which is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2? Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. For N=3, it's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5 *4 /2 = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm getting confused between the quantum numbers. Another approach is to think in terms of the angular momentum quantum number l. Because for each N, the possible l values are from 0 to N.

Wait, no, that's for hydrogen-like atoms. In the harmonic oscillator, it's a different situation. Wait, the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates uses quantum numbers n and l, where n is the principal quantum number combining the radial and angular parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think more clearly.

In the harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Each direction has n_x, n_y, n_z, and N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So yes, energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So the ground state is N=0, energy (3/2) ħω. First excited N=1, energy  (5/2) ħω. Second excited N=2, energy (7/2) ħω. Third excited N=3, energy (9/2) ħω.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, which matches options A and C.

Now, the degeneracy, the number of states, for N=3 is (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 10. So looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, 10.

Wait, but wait. Another way to compute the number of states is using the formula for each N. The degeneracy is (N+1)(N+2)/2. Wait, for N=0, it's (1)(2)/2=1. Correct. For N=1, (2)(3)/2=3. For N=2, (3)(4)/2=6. For N=3, (4)(5)/2=10. So yes, that's correct.

So the options are A and C. Looking at the options, option A has the right energy and the right number of states. Option C has energy correct but number of states as 3, which is for N=1.

So looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħ ω, 10 → correct.

Option C: (9/2) ħ ω, 3 → no, that's for N=1, which is the first excited state.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by $E = \hbar \omega (N + 3/2)$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy, is determined by the number of ways to partition $N$ into $n_x, n_y, n_z$, which is given by $\frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of that state. The ground state corresponds to $N=0$, the first excited state to $N=1$, the second excited state to $N=2$, and the third excited state to $N=3$. For $N=3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega (3 + 3/2) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $N=3$ is:

\[
\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

From the given options, only **Option A** matches both the energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy 10. The other options either have incorrect energy values or incorrect degeneracies.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which means it's a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions because it depends on r squared, and since r is the radial distance, it's symmetric in all directions.

First, I remember that in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on the principal quantum number n, which is related to the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions (x, y, z). But wait, in three dimensions, especially in spherical coordinates, it's often described using the quantum numbers n_r and l, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

The energy levels are given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, I think that's when each dimension contributes n_x + n_y + n_z = n, but actually, the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh, right. So each of the three dimensions contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, but when you sum them, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, another way to think about it is that the energy levels are E = ħω (N + 3/2), where N is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So N can be 0,1,2,... Each N corresponds to a certain energy level. The degeneracy of each level depends on how many ways you can get N by adding n_x, n_y, n_z.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the energy is often described with a different approach. Another way to think is that the energy levels are E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer. So each n corresponds to a certain energy. But wait, in 3D, for each n, there's a certain number of states with the same n but different angular momentum quantum numbers l, etc.

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with the hydrogen atom. Let me think again. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction has a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, and the total N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So for each N, the energy level is the same for all states with that N.

The number of possible states (eigenfunctions) for a given N is the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers, n_x, n_y, n_z, which is (N+2 choose 2), or (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for each N, the degeneracy is (N+1)(N+2)/2.

Wait, wait, let me think. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 3 -1) choose (3 -1) ) = (N+2 choose 2) ), which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. So yeah, that's the degeneracy, the number of states for each N.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is N=0, since the lowest energy is when each direction is at its lowest state. So the first excited state would be N=1, second N=2, third N=3.

Wait, no. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state is the next higher energy, which is N=1. The second excited state is N=2, third is N=3.

So the third excited state is N=3. So the energy is E = ħω (3 + 3/2) = ħω (9/2) = (9/2) ħω.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again. The formula is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So for N=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's correct.

Now, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for this energy is the degeneracy, which is (3 + 1)(3 + 2)/2? Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. For N=3, it's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5 *4 /2 = 10. So 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm getting confused between the quantum numbers. Another approach is to think in terms of the angular momentum quantum number l. Because for each N, the possible l values are from 0 to N.

Wait, no, that's for hydrogen-like atoms. In the harmonic oscillator, it's a different situation. Wait, the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates uses quantum numbers n and l, where n is the principal quantum number combining the radial and angular parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think more clearly.

In the harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Each direction has n_x, n_y, n_z, and N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So yes, energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2). So the ground state is N=0, energy (3/2) ħω. First excited N=1, energy  (5/2) ħω. Second excited N=2, energy (7/2) ħω. Third excited N=3, energy (9/2) ħω.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, which matches options A and C.

Now, the degeneracy, the number of states, for N=3 is (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 10. So looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, 10.

Wait, but wait. Another way to compute the number of states is using the formula for each N. The degeneracy is (N+1)(N+2)/2. Wait, for N=0, it's (1)(2)/2=1. Correct. For N=1, (2)(3)/2=3. For N=2, (3)(4)/2=6. For N=3, (4)(5)/2=10. So yes, that's correct.

So the options are A and C. Looking at the options, option A has the right energy and the right number of states. Option C has energy correct but number of states as 3, which is for N=1.

So looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħ ω, 10 → correct.

Option C: (9/2) ħ ω, 3 → no, that's for N=1, which is the first excited state.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by $E = \hbar \omega (N + 3/2)$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of that state. The ground state corresponds to $N=0$, the first excited state to $N=1$, the second excited state to $N=2$, and the third excited state to $N=3$. For $N=3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega (3 + 3/2) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $N=3$ is:

\[
\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

From the given options, only **Option A** matches both the energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy 10. The other options either have incorrect energy values or incorrect degeneracies.
