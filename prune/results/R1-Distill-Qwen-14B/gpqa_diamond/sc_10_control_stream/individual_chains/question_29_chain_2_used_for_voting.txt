Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The person is using EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a type of chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, often leading to single nucleotide changes. They sequenced the target gene in all the mutants and found changes in the first exon area.

The task is to determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the right mutation should disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein structure.

Looking at the options, the intact gene and each mutant are provided. Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, each mutant has a change in the beginning. Let me compare each one.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene: The first part is ATGTTTCTCGC... For Mutant 1, the sequence is ATGTTCTACGC. Let me see the differences. So the part where the intact has TTT CTC GCT, mutant 1 has TCT ACG.

Wait, let me look at the exact positions. Let's break it down.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the change occurs. Let me write the first part:

Intact: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: 5' ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT...

So in position where the intact has CTC (the third codon), Mutant1 has CTA. Wait, no, perhaps I should index each nucleotide. Let me count the bases.

Wait, the first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Let me write it as:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…

So each three letters is a codon. So the first few codons are:

1: ATG (start)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAA (Gln)
12: TAT (Tyr)
13: TTA (Leu)
14: TGC G (so last part is TGT, CGT?)

Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each line.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon of the intact gene is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu as well, because CTA is also Leu). So no change in amino acid here. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), mutant1 has CGC, which is Arg. So the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg. So the fourth amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. So this is a missense mutation. Not a frameshift, so the reading frame remains the same. But does this change cause a problem? It changes the amino acid, but whether it disrupts the protein's function is unclear. It might not cause a complete loss, but perhaps a change in function. But the question is about eliminating the compound, so maybe a missense could do that, but perhaps a more disruptive mutation is needed.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, let me compare:

Intact starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), which in mutant2 is CTA (Leu again). The fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant2 it’s AGC (Ser), and then TGG (Trp) and others. Wait, maybe I should look at the exact letters.

The intact from the start is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So let me look for where the changes occur. Let me align:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, perhaps the changes are in the third codon onwards. Wait, the first part of Mutant2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, in the third codon position, the intact has CTC (Leu), and mutant2 has CTA (Leu). Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) becomes AGC (Ser). Then the next codon after that is TGG in mutant2, while in intact it's GGT. Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me write the sequences again.

Intact gene: [positions 1-30 or so]
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT
10: GAA
11: CAA
12: TAT
13: TTA
14: TTG
15: TCG
16: TGA

Mutant2's sequence: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon is GCT in intact, and in mutant2, it's AGC. So position 4: GCT becomes AGC. Then position 5: GGT becomes TGG. Position 6: ACT becomes TAC. Hmm, that changes a lot. But again, these are missense mutations. No frameshift, so the rest of the protein is read correctly, but multiple amino acids are changed. But whether that disrupts the function? Not sure.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, which in the middle has GGT ACT TCT GTG... So Mutant3's sequence is GGTGTCACT. So in the intact, it's GGT ACT TCT, whereas in Mutant3, it's GGT GTC ACT? Wait, let me see.

Let me compare:

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the fifth codon in the intact is ACT (Thr), and in Mutant3, it becomes GTC (Val). So the sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), but in Mutant3, it's ACT (Thr). So those two codons are swapped. But again, it's a missense mutation, so the protein may have different amino acids but not a frameshift. Not sure if this would eliminate the compound.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at this, the middle part is: TAC GCT ACT.

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So in intact, it's GGT ACT TCT. In Mutant4, it's TAC GCT ACT. So the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in intact. In Mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), but in Mutant4, it's GCT (Ala). So, the fifth and sixth codons are changed. Again, missense, no frameshift.

Wait, but let me think about what each mutation does. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a loss-of-function mutation is needed. The way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the enzyme that makes the compound.

So, perhaps a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would be best, but looking at the options, do any of the mutants introduce a stop codon?

Looking at the sequences again. Let me see if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon. The stop codons in DNA are TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene ends with ...TGA-3’ (as shown at the end). So the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1 ends with ...TCGC…TGA. So the stop codon is still present at the end.

Mutant2: same, ends with ...TCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: same ending.

Mutant4: same ending.

So the stop codon is intact in all, so no nonsense mutation in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a premature stop. But looking at the mutants, the changes are all in the first exon, and I think the changes are single nucleotide substitutions because EMS is a point mutagen.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Compare the two sequences:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, no, let me look at the exact nucleotides. Let me count:

Intact line: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1:     5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, where is the change?

Looking at the first 20 nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA

So at position 3, the codon is CTC in intact, and CTA in mutant1. Then position 4: GCT becomes CGC.

CTA is Leu (same as CTC), CGC is Arg. So the fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So one amino acid change. No frameshift, so the rest of the codons are read correctly.

So this is a missense mutation, changing two amino acids (third codon same, fourth codon changes).

Mutant2: 

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, the third codon is CTC -> CTA (Leu same), the fourth codon GCT becomes AGC (Ser), and the fifth codon GGT becomes TGG (Trp). So the fifth codon changes from Gly to Trp, the fourth from Ala to Ser.

So two changes, again missense.

Mutant3:

Intact: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGG...

So looking at where the change occurs: the fifth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), while in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), mutant3 has ACT (Thr). So two amino acids changed; missense.

Mutant4:

Intact: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the fifth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), while in mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), while in mutant4 it's GCT (Ala). So two amino acids changed again.

Wait, but maybe I should look for any possible frameshift. Because if a mutation causes a frameshift, it could lead to a completely different reading frame and a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequences, the mutations are all single substitutions, so no insertions or deletions. So no frameshift.

Hmm. So all the mutations are missense, meaning they change one amino acid (or a few), but the protein is still made, just with some altered amino acids.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. If the beginning of the gene is the start codon and the beginning of the protein, any mutation there could have a big effect. For instance, if the start codon is altered, the protein wouldn't be made at all. But looking at the sequences, the start codon is ATG in all cases. So the first codon is unchanged.

But perhaps the mutation occurs in the region after the start codon but in an early exon, maybe leading to a frameshift if there are insertions or deletions. But in this case, all the mutations seem to be substitutions. So perhaps no frameshift.

Wait, I must have missed something. Let me check each mutant's sequence more carefully.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence, the middle part is TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

In the intact, it's GG TACTTCTGTGG.

Wait, the exact sequence of intact is ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4's is ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the sequence GGTA becomes TACG, right? So let me see the nucleotides:

Intact: G G T A C T T C T G T G G...
Mutant4: T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...

Wait, perhaps that's a longer change. Let me count the exact nucleotides.

Looking at the intact gene, the region is:

...GGTACTTCTGTGG...

Which is 6 nucleotides: G G T A C T T C T G T G G.

Wait, maybe not, perhaps it's better to see that the sequence in intact is ...GCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4 is ...GCTACTTCT...

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a frameshift. Let me count the letters.

Wait, the original gene's first part is 30 nucleotides or so. Let me count for each mutant.

But perhaps a better approach is to look for any possible in-frame stop codons. If a mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, the protein would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Looking at each mutant's sequences:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the TGA is the stop codon at the end. Now, in the mutants, do any of them have a TGA or TAG or TAA before that?

Let me look:

Mutant1 ends with ...TCGC…TGA. So, after the mutation, the last part is TCGC followed by TGA, same as intact.

Mutant2: ...TCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...TCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: ...TCGT…TGA.

So, none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So that approach might not work.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, perhaps the reading frame is shifted such that a stop codon appears earlier.

But earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to find a mutation that disrupts the reading frame, but in this case, all changes are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the gene is alternatively spliced, but I don't think that's relevant here because the question is about mutating the gene itself.

Wait, but the question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns. But the mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps the changes are in the first exon, which could disrupt the start or early part of the protein.

But all the mutations are in the coding regions, leading to amino acid changes. So the question is, which of these would lead to a nonfunctional enzyme, thus eliminating the compound.

In such cases, a nonsense mutation (stop codon) would be ideal, but none of the mutants have that. So perhaps the next best is a frameshift, but I don't see any. So perhaps a missense mutation that disrupts a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that creates a new splice site, but the question doesn't indicate that.

Wait, looking at the sequences again. Let me check each mutant's DNA changes.

Let me compare the intact gene and each mutant's sequence:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, for Mutant4, the sequence after the change is ...TACGCTACTTCT...

In the intact, it's ...GCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the first part of the gene:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

Wait, so in Mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GCT (Ala), and the sixth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, two amino acid changes.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the exons. The first exon is the beginning, so any mutation there could affect the start or early part of the protein. But in all mutants, the start codon is intact.

Another possibility is a silent mutation, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the mutation disrupts a critical region, like a signal peptide or an active site.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon by introducing a TGA or TAG or TAA codon.

Wait, looking again at the sequences. Let me look for any possible in-frame stop codon in the mutants.

In the intact gene, the stop codon is at the very end (TGA). So, if any of the mutations introduce another TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle, that would cause a premature stop.

Looking at Mutant1's DNA sequence:

...TCGC…TGA. So the last part is TCGC, then TGA. So the DNA is TCG C TGA.

The codons would be TCG (Ser), C (wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me count.

Wait, the end part is TCGC followed by TGA.

But let me see the last part of Mutant1's sequence: ...GTCGC…TGA.

So the last part is G T C G C ... T G A.

Breaking into triplets:

...GTC G C TGA.

Wait, that can't be right because the stop codon is the last three.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the entire sequence. Let me take the end of the gene:

Intact: ...GTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA

So for the last part, the last few codons are:

Intact: ...GTC GT (no, wait, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me see.

Wait, it's getting a bit confusing. Let me think: the last part of the gene is ...GTCGT…TGA. So, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

In Mutant1, the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA.

So, the last few nucleotides before TGA are C G C. So the codon before TGA is CGC. CGC is Arg.

So no stop codon introduced.

Similarly, checking Mutant2: ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. The last codon before stop is GCG (Ala), then TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same.

So, no, none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation elsewhere. Let me go back.

Another approach: the question is about knocking out the gene so that the compound isn't produced. So a frameshift that leads to a premature stop would be best, but the mutations are all substitutions, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TACGCTACTTCT...

The DNA sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So codons are TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

No stop codons here.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the mutation leads to the creation of a stop codon early in the gene.

Wait, let's look at Mutant4's sequence again.

Mutant4's DNA in the affected region is TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Which translates into TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exons. The first exon is the one that's mutated. If the mutation is in the first exon and causes a change early in the protein, maybe it disrupts a critical region.

For example, if the mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon, but I don't see any of the mutants introducing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site, but that's more about introns, which aren't the focus here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region, but the changes are in the exon.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But none of the mutants do that. So perhaps the best bet is a mutation that completely changes a region of the protein, making it nonfunctional.

Looking at the options, which mutant creates the most drastic change?

Mutant3's change is in the middle of the sequence. Let me look at the exact change.

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in intact, and becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3. Then the sixth codon, TCT (Ser) in intact, becomes ACT (Thr) in mutant3.

So, two amino acid changes, but in the middle of the protein.

Mutant4's change is more significant perhaps. Let me look: in the middle, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GCT (Ala), and the sixth is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So two changes again.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about each codon's position.

But without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say which amino acid changes would be more disruptive.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, but since none exist, the best option is to find a mutation that creates a frameshift, but again, the mutations are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check whether any of the mutations are in the first exon and perhaps create a stop codon.

Wait, looking again: The intact gene's entire sequence is given, and the first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

So, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: sequence ends with ...TGA, same as intact.

Mutant2: same.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: same.

So no premature stops.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that one of the mutants introduces a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the exact DNA sequences again for possible stop codons.

Wait, looking at Mutant4 again: the sequence is ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Which is TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons here.

Wait, perhaps looking at the DNA sequence for any early TGA or TAG or TAA.

Looking at Mutant3's DNA: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACT...

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

The sequence is TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

No, no stop codons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for which mutation would result in the loss of the gene's function, perhaps by disrupting a critical region early in the gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a frameshift mutation, but since all are point mutations, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it introduces a change that causes a frameshift. Wait, but earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let me look at the exact positions where each mutant differs.

Looking at the intact gene's first part:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the change occurs at the third and fourth codons. Let me compare the DNA sequences:

Intact: positions 3-5 are CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala) at positions 6-8.

Mutant1: positions 3-5 are CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg) at positions 6-8.

So, no frameshift, just substitution.

Mutant2:

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant2: CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

So again, substitution.

Mutant3:

Intact: GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Again substitution.

Mutant4:

Intact: GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Substitution.

So, all are substitution mutations, no frameshifts.

Hmm. Then, the only way to eliminate the compound is to have a nonfunctional gene product. The best way is a premature stop codon, but none of the mutants have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that one of the mutants introduces a stop codon elsewhere. Let me check the sequences again.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in the middle. Let me see:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

No, TGA is the last codon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT TCT.

So, codon 5 is TAC (Tyr), codon 6 is GCT (Ala), codon 7 is ACT (Thr), codon 8 is TCT (Ser), etc.

No stop codon in the middle.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think about the options. The question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps the changes in the first exon are in the beginning of the protein, making it nonfunctional.

But without any stop codon, the protein will be produced but possibly nonfunctional if the mutation is in a critical region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a shorter protein. But I don't see any new ATG in the mutants.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the exon, so probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon via a different reading frame, but that would require a frameshift.

Wait, but all the mutations are substitutions, so the reading frame remains the same.

Hmm. Maybe it's about the position of the mutation. If the mutation is in the first exon and early in the gene, it might disrupt a critical function.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Mutant2: Change in codons 4 and 5.

Option B) Mutant3: Changes in codons 5 and 6.

Option C) Mutant1: Change in codons 3 and 4.

Option D) Mutant4: Changes in codons 5 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it disrupts two codons, leading to a more significant change. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 disrupts the start of a domain in the protein.

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon when considering alternative reading frames, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of changes. Mutant4 has two changes in the middle of a longer stretch, while others have one or two changes elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation is in the first exon and leads to a frameshift, but earlier I thought it's substitution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the nucleotides. Let me recount.

Intact gene: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, no, that can't be right because the length of the sequence would change if it's a deletion. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the exact sequence is:

Intact: ... G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G ...
Mutant4: ... T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G ...

So, each triplet:

Intact: GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

So, in Mutant4, the first codon after the change is TAC instead of GCT, then GCT, then ACT instead of GGT.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should look for any possible in-frame stop codons.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes more nucleotides in the exon, leading to a more significant effect.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes two codons, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question states that the gene consists of five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon. So, perhaps the first exon has a critical region, like the promoter or the start codon.

But the start codon is unchanged in all mutants. So it's about the coding region.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but that's more about introns, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a shorter mRNA because part of the exon is skipped, but that's more about splicing, which requires intron mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a nonsense mutation in the first exon, leading to a truncated protein. But I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me take Mutant4's DNA sequence in the region of the mutation.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the DNA is T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...

Breaking into triplets:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the codons are:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codon here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what each option does.

The question is which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene product to be nonfunctional. So the best way is a premature stop codon, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, a frameshift leading to a scrambled protein, but no frameshift mutations are present.

So perhaps the next best is a nonsense mutation, but none exist. Therefore, perhaps the answer is the mutation that changes the most critical amino acids, perhaps in the active site of the enzyme.

But without knowing the structure, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon when considering a different reading frame. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the mutations. Let me look again for any possible stop codon.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's DNA:

...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

The DNA sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, triplets:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation is in the first exon and changes two codons, which might disrupt a critical region. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3, which changes two codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon from ACT (Thr) to TAC (Tyr) and the sixth from TCT (Ser) to ACT (Thr). But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation leads to a frameshift, but I thought earlier that all mutations are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the length of each mutant's sequence.

Intact gene: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the intact has GGT ACT TCT, while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT.

So, in terms of nucleotides, the intact has G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4 has T A C G C T A C T...

Wait, that's 9 nucleotides in the intact, and 9 in Mutant4. So the length is the same, no frameshift.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
That's 15 nucleotides.

Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, that's 15 as well.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

The question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it changes the fifth and sixth codons, which could disrupt a critical region, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme. Alternatively, perhaps it's C) Mutant1 because it changes the fourth codon from Ala to Arg, which could affect the structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a new start codon, leading to a truncated protein. But looking at the sequence, the first codon is still ATG, so no.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes two codons in the middle, which might disrupt a crucial part of the protein. Alternatively, perhaps it's Mutant4 because the change leads to an alternative reading frame, but I don't see that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 introduces a stop codon when considering a different reading frame. For example, if the reading frame shifts, but that's only possible with insertions or deletions. Since all are substitutions, no shift.

I think I've exhausted my options. The most probable answer is that Mutant4 disrupts the gene enough to eliminate the compound. So I'll choose D) Mutant4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene**: The sequence is provided as `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`. The stop codon `TGA` is at the end.
2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: Changes occur in codons 4 and 5, altering the amino acids from Ala to Arg and leaving the rest of the sequence intact. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: Changes occur in codons 4 and 5, altering the amino acids from Ala to Ser and Gly to Trp. Again, no frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: Changes occur in codons 5 and 6, altering the amino acids from Thr to Val and Ser to Thr. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 4**: Changes occur in codons 5 and 6, altering the amino acids from Thr to Tyr and Gly to Ala. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.

3. **Critical Points**:
   - None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (`TGA`, `TAG`, or `TAA`) in the middle of the sequence.
   - All mutations are point substitutions, so no frameshift occurs, and the reading frame remains intact.
   - The mutations in Mutant 4 affect two codons in the middle of the sequence, potentially disrupting a critical functional region of the protein.

### Conclusion:
While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4 disrupts two codons in the middle of the sequence, which could significantly alter the protein's structure and function. This makes Mutant 4 the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The person is using EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a type of chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, often leading to single nucleotide changes. They sequenced the target gene in all the mutants and found changes in the first exon area.

The task is to determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the right mutation should disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a missense mutation that disrupts the protein structure.

Looking at the options, the intact gene and each mutant are provided. Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, each mutant has a change in the beginning. Let me compare each one.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene: The first part is ATGTTTCTCGC... For Mutant 1, the sequence is ATGTTCTACGC. Let me see the differences. So the part where the intact has TTT CTC GCT, mutant 1 has TCT ACG.

Wait, let me look at the exact positions. Let's break it down.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the change occurs. Let me write the first part:

Intact: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: 5' ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT...

So in position where the intact has CTC (the third codon), Mutant1 has CTA. Wait, no, perhaps I should index each nucleotide. Let me count the bases.

Wait, the first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Let me write it as:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…

So each three letters is a codon. So the first few codons are:

1: ATG (start)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAA (Gln)
12: TAT (Tyr)
13: TTA (Leu)
14: TGC G (so last part is TGT, CGT?)

Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are. Let me compare each line.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

So comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon of the intact gene is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu as well, because CTA is also Leu). So no change in amino acid here. Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), mutant1 has CGC, which is Arg. So the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg. So the fourth amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. So this is a missense mutation. Not a frameshift, so the reading frame remains the same. But does this change cause a problem? It changes the amino acid, but whether it disrupts the protein's function is unclear. It might not cause a complete loss, but perhaps a change in function. But the question is about eliminating the compound, so maybe a missense could do that, but perhaps a more disruptive mutation is needed.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, let me compare:

Intact starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), which in mutant2 is CTA (Leu again). The fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant2 it’s AGC (Ser), and then TGG (Trp) and others. Wait, maybe I should look at the exact letters.

The intact from the start is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So let me look for where the changes occur. Let me align:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, perhaps the changes are in the third codon onwards. Wait, the first part of Mutant2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So, in the third codon position, the intact has CTC (Leu), and mutant2 has CTA (Leu). Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) becomes AGC (Ser). Then the next codon after that is TGG in mutant2, while in intact it's GGT. Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me write the sequences again.

Intact gene: [positions 1-30 or so]
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT
10: GAA
11: CAA
12: TAT
13: TTA
14: TTG
15: TCG
16: TGA

Mutant2's sequence: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCGC...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon is GCT in intact, and in mutant2, it's AGC. So position 4: GCT becomes AGC. Then position 5: GGT becomes TGG. Position 6: ACT becomes TAC. Hmm, that changes a lot. But again, these are missense mutations. No frameshift, so the rest of the protein is read correctly, but multiple amino acids are changed. But whether that disrupts the function? Not sure.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, which in the middle has GGT ACT TCT GTG... So Mutant3's sequence is GGTGTCACT. So in the intact, it's GGT ACT TCT, whereas in Mutant3, it's GGT GTC ACT? Wait, let me see.

Let me compare:

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the fifth codon in the intact is ACT (Thr), and in Mutant3, it becomes GTC (Val). So the sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), but in Mutant3, it's ACT (Thr). So those two codons are swapped. But again, it's a missense mutation, so the protein may have different amino acids but not a frameshift. Not sure if this would eliminate the compound.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at this, the middle part is: TAC GCT ACT.

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So in intact, it's GGT ACT TCT. In Mutant4, it's TAC GCT ACT. So the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in intact. In Mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), but in Mutant4, it's GCT (Ala). So, the fifth and sixth codons are changed. Again, missense, no frameshift.

Wait, but let me think about what each mutation does. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests a loss-of-function mutation is needed. The way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene so it doesn't produce the enzyme that makes the compound.

So, perhaps a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) would be best, but looking at the options, do any of the mutants introduce a stop codon?

Looking at the sequences again. Let me see if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon. The stop codons in DNA are TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene ends with ...TGA-3’ (as shown at the end). So the last part is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1 ends with ...TCGC…TGA. So the stop codon is still present at the end.

Mutant2: same, ends with ...TCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: same ending.

Mutant4: same ending.

So the stop codon is intact in all, so no nonsense mutation in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift would disrupt the reading frame, leading to a premature stop. But looking at the mutants, the changes are all in the first exon, and I think the changes are single nucleotide substitutions because EMS is a point mutagen.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Compare the two sequences:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, no, let me look at the exact nucleotides. Let me count:

Intact line: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1:     5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, where is the change?

Looking at the first 20 nucleotides:

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA

So at position 3, the codon is CTC in intact, and CTA in mutant1. Then position 4: GCT becomes CGC.

CTA is Leu (same as CTC), CGC is Arg. So the fourth codon changes from Ala (GCT) to Arg (CGC). So one amino acid change. No frameshift, so the rest of the codons are read correctly.

So this is a missense mutation, changing two amino acids (third codon same, fourth codon changes).

Mutant2: 

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, the third codon is CTC -> CTA (Leu same), the fourth codon GCT becomes AGC (Ser), and the fifth codon GGT becomes TGG (Trp). So the fifth codon changes from Gly to Trp, the fourth from Ala to Ser.

So two changes, again missense.

Mutant3:

Intact: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGG...

So looking at where the change occurs: the fifth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), while in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), mutant3 has ACT (Thr). So two amino acids changed; missense.

Mutant4:

Intact: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the fifth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), while in mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr). The sixth codon in intact is TCT (Ser), while in mutant4 it's GCT (Ala). So two amino acids changed again.

Wait, but maybe I should look for any possible frameshift. Because if a mutation causes a frameshift, it could lead to a completely different reading frame and a premature stop codon. But looking at the sequences, the mutations are all single substitutions, so no insertions or deletions. So no frameshift.

Hmm. So all the mutations are missense, meaning they change one amino acid (or a few), but the protein is still made, just with some altered amino acids.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. If the beginning of the gene is the start codon and the beginning of the protein, any mutation there could have a big effect. For instance, if the start codon is altered, the protein wouldn't be made at all. But looking at the sequences, the start codon is ATG in all cases. So the first codon is unchanged.

But perhaps the mutation occurs in the region after the start codon but in an early exon, maybe leading to a frameshift if there are insertions or deletions. But in this case, all the mutations seem to be substitutions. So perhaps no frameshift.

Wait, I must have missed something. Let me check each mutant's sequence more carefully.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence, the middle part is TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

In the intact, it's GG TACTTCTGTGG.

Wait, the exact sequence of intact is ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4's is ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the sequence GGTA becomes TACG, right? So let me see the nucleotides:

Intact: G G T A C T T C T G T G G...
Mutant4: T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...

Wait, perhaps that's a longer change. Let me count the exact nucleotides.

Looking at the intact gene, the region is:

...GGTACTTCTGTGG...

Which is 6 nucleotides: G G T A C T T C T G T G G.

Wait, maybe not, perhaps it's better to see that the sequence in intact is ...GCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4 is ...GCTACTTCT...

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a frameshift. Let me count the letters.

Wait, the original gene's first part is 30 nucleotides or so. Let me count for each mutant.

But perhaps a better approach is to look for any possible in-frame stop codons. If a mutation introduces a stop codon earlier, the protein would be truncated, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Looking at each mutant's sequences:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the TGA is the stop codon at the end. Now, in the mutants, do any of them have a TGA or TAG or TAA before that?

Let me look:

Mutant1 ends with ...TCGC…TGA. So, after the mutation, the last part is TCGC followed by TGA, same as intact.

Mutant2: ...TCGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...TCGT…TGA.

Mutant4: ...TCGT…TGA.

So, none of the mutations introduce an early stop codon. So that approach might not work.

Wait, but perhaps in Mutant4, perhaps the reading frame is shifted such that a stop codon appears earlier.

But earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions, so no frameshift. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to find a mutation that disrupts the reading frame, but in this case, all changes are substitutions, so no frameshift.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the gene is alternatively spliced, but I don't think that's relevant here because the question is about mutating the gene itself.

Wait, but the question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns. But the mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps the changes are in the first exon, which could disrupt the start or early part of the protein.

But all the mutations are in the coding regions, leading to amino acid changes. So the question is, which of these would lead to a nonfunctional enzyme, thus eliminating the compound.

In such cases, a nonsense mutation (stop codon) would be ideal, but none of the mutants have that. So perhaps the next best is a frameshift, but I don't see any. So perhaps a missense mutation that disrupts a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps a mutation that creates a new splice site, but the question doesn't indicate that.

Wait, looking at the sequences again. Let me check each mutant's DNA changes.

Let me compare the intact gene and each mutant's sequence:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, for Mutant4, the sequence after the change is ...TACGCTACTTCT...

In the intact, it's ...GCTGGTACTTCT...

So, the first part of the gene:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

Wait, so in Mutant4, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GCT (Ala), and the sixth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, two amino acid changes.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the exons. The first exon is the beginning, so any mutation there could affect the start or early part of the protein. But in all mutants, the start codon is intact.

Another possibility is a silent mutation, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the mutation disrupts a critical region, like a signal peptide or an active site.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon by introducing a TGA or TAG or TAA codon.

Wait, looking again at the sequences. Let me look for any possible in-frame stop codon in the mutants.

In the intact gene, the stop codon is at the very end (TGA). So, if any of the mutations introduce another TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle, that would cause a premature stop.

Looking at Mutant1's DNA sequence:

...TCGC…TGA. So the last part is TCGC, then TGA. So the DNA is TCG C TGA.

The codons would be TCG (Ser), C (wait, no, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me count.

Wait, the end part is TCGC followed by TGA.

But let me see the last part of Mutant1's sequence: ...GTCGC…TGA.

So the last part is G T C G C ... T G A.

Breaking into triplets:

...GTC G C TGA.

Wait, that can't be right because the stop codon is the last three.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the entire sequence. Let me take the end of the gene:

Intact: ...GTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ...GTCGC…TGA

So for the last part, the last few codons are:

Intact: ...GTC GT (no, wait, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me see.

Wait, it's getting a bit confusing. Let me think: the last part of the gene is ...GTCGT…TGA. So, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

In Mutant1, the sequence is ...GTCGC…TGA.

So, the last few nucleotides before TGA are C G C. So the codon before TGA is CGC. CGC is Arg.

So no stop codon introduced.

Similarly, checking Mutant2: ends with ...GTCGC…TGA. The last codon before stop is GCG (Ala), then TGA.

Mutant3: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant4: ...GTCGT…TGA. Same.

So, no, none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation elsewhere. Let me go back.

Another approach: the question is about knocking out the gene so that the compound isn't produced. So a frameshift that leads to a premature stop would be best, but the mutations are all substitutions, so no frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence: ...TACGCTACTTCT...

The DNA sequence is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So codons are TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc.

No stop codons here.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the mutation leads to the creation of a stop codon early in the gene.

Wait, let's look at Mutant4's sequence again.

Mutant4's DNA in the affected region is TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Which translates into TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exons. The first exon is the one that's mutated. If the mutation is in the first exon and causes a change early in the protein, maybe it disrupts a critical region.

For example, if the mutation creates a stop codon in the first exon, but I don't see any of the mutants introducing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site, but that's more about introns, which aren't the focus here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region, but the changes are in the exon.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But none of the mutants do that. So perhaps the best bet is a mutation that completely changes a region of the protein, making it nonfunctional.

Looking at the options, which mutant creates the most drastic change?

Mutant3's change is in the middle of the sequence. Let me look at the exact change.

Intact: ...GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ...GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) in intact, and becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3. Then the sixth codon, TCT (Ser) in intact, becomes ACT (Thr) in mutant3.

So, two amino acid changes, but in the middle of the protein.

Mutant4's change is more significant perhaps. Let me look: in the middle, the fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GCT (Ala), and the sixth is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So two changes again.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about each codon's position.

But without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say which amino acid changes would be more disruptive.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, but since none exist, the best option is to find a mutation that creates a frameshift, but again, the mutations are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check whether any of the mutations are in the first exon and perhaps create a stop codon.

Wait, looking again: The intact gene's entire sequence is given, and the first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG TGA

So, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: sequence ends with ...TGA, same as intact.

Mutant2: same.

Mutant3: same.

Mutant4: same.

So no premature stops.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that one of the mutants introduces a stop codon in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the exact DNA sequences again for possible stop codons.

Wait, looking at Mutant4 again: the sequence is ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Which is TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons here.

Wait, perhaps looking at the DNA sequence for any early TGA or TAG or TAA.

Looking at Mutant3's DNA: ...TACGCTGGTGTCACT...

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

The sequence is TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

No, no stop codons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for which mutation would result in the loss of the gene's function, perhaps by disrupting a critical region early in the gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a frameshift mutation, but since all are point mutations, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it introduces a change that causes a frameshift. Wait, but earlier I thought all mutations are substitutions. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let me look at the exact positions where each mutant differs.

Looking at the intact gene's first part:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the change occurs at the third and fourth codons. Let me compare the DNA sequences:

Intact: positions 3-5 are CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala) at positions 6-8.

Mutant1: positions 3-5 are CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg) at positions 6-8.

So, no frameshift, just substitution.

Mutant2:

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant2: CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

So again, substitution.

Mutant3:

Intact: GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Again substitution.

Mutant4:

Intact: GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Substitution.

So, all are substitution mutations, no frameshifts.

Hmm. Then, the only way to eliminate the compound is to have a nonfunctional gene product. The best way is a premature stop codon, but none of the mutants have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that one of the mutants introduces a stop codon elsewhere. Let me check the sequences again.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA in the middle. Let me see:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

No, TGA is the last codon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT ACT TCT.

So, codon 5 is TAC (Tyr), codon 6 is GCT (Ala), codon 7 is ACT (Thr), codon 8 is TCT (Ser), etc.

No stop codon in the middle.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think about the options. The question says the gene has five exons and four introns. The mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps the changes in the first exon are in the beginning of the protein, making it nonfunctional.

But without any stop codon, the protein will be produced but possibly nonfunctional if the mutation is in a critical region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a shorter protein. But I don't see any new ATG in the mutants.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the exon, so probably not affecting splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon via a different reading frame, but that would require a frameshift.

Wait, but all the mutations are substitutions, so the reading frame remains the same.

Hmm. Maybe it's about the position of the mutation. If the mutation is in the first exon and early in the gene, it might disrupt a critical function.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Mutant2: Change in codons 4 and 5.

Option B) Mutant3: Changes in codons 5 and 6.

Option C) Mutant1: Change in codons 3 and 4.

Option D) Mutant4: Changes in codons 5 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it disrupts two codons, leading to a more significant change. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 disrupts the start of a domain in the protein.

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon when considering alternative reading frames, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of changes. Mutant4 has two changes in the middle of a longer stretch, while others have one or two changes elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation is in the first exon and leads to a frameshift, but earlier I thought it's substitution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the nucleotides. Let me recount.

Intact gene: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, no, that can't be right because the length of the sequence would change if it's a deletion. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the exact sequence is:

Intact: ... G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G ...
Mutant4: ... T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G ...

So, each triplet:

Intact: GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

So, in Mutant4, the first codon after the change is TAC instead of GCT, then GCT, then ACT instead of GGT.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should look for any possible in-frame stop codons.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes more nucleotides in the exon, leading to a more significant effect.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes two codons, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question states that the gene consists of five exons and four introns, and the mutations are in the first exon. So, perhaps the first exon has a critical region, like the promoter or the start codon.

But the start codon is unchanged in all mutants. So it's about the coding region.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but that's more about introns, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a shorter mRNA because part of the exon is skipped, but that's more about splicing, which requires intron mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a nonsense mutation in the first exon, leading to a truncated protein. But I don't see any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me take Mutant4's DNA sequence in the region of the mutation.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the DNA is T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G...

Breaking into triplets:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the codons are:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codon here.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what each option does.

The question is which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene product to be nonfunctional. So the best way is a premature stop codon, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, a frameshift leading to a scrambled protein, but no frameshift mutations are present.

So perhaps the next best is a nonsense mutation, but none exist. Therefore, perhaps the answer is the mutation that changes the most critical amino acids, perhaps in the active site of the enzyme.

But without knowing the structure, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon when considering a different reading frame. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the mutations. Let me look again for any possible stop codon.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's DNA:

...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

The DNA sequence is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, triplets:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation is in the first exon and changes two codons, which might disrupt a critical region. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3, which changes two codons in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon from ACT (Thr) to TAC (Tyr) and the sixth from TCT (Ser) to ACT (Thr). But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the mutation leads to a frameshift, but I thought earlier that all mutations are substitutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the length of each mutant's sequence.

Intact gene: ...GGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant4: ...TACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

So, the intact has GGT ACT TCT, while Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT.

So, in terms of nucleotides, the intact has G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4 has T A C G C T A C T...

Wait, that's 9 nucleotides in the intact, and 9 in Mutant4. So the length is the same, no frameshift.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me count the nucleotides.

Intact: ...GCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
That's 15 nucleotides.

Mutant4: ...GCTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, that's 15 as well.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant2

B) Mutant3

C) Mutant1

D) Mutant4

The question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it changes the fifth and sixth codons, which could disrupt a critical region, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme. Alternatively, perhaps it's C) Mutant1 because it changes the fourth codon from Ala to Arg, which could affect the structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a new start codon, leading to a truncated protein. But looking at the sequence, the first codon is still ATG, so no.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the options, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes two codons in the middle, which might disrupt a crucial part of the protein. Alternatively, perhaps it's Mutant4 because the change leads to an alternative reading frame, but I don't see that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 introduces a stop codon when considering a different reading frame. For example, if the reading frame shifts, but that's only possible with insertions or deletions. Since all are substitutions, no shift.

I think I've exhausted my options. The most probable answer is that Mutant4 disrupts the gene enough to eliminate the compound. So I'll choose D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene**: The sequence is provided as `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`. The stop codon `TGA` is at the end.
2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: Changes occur in codons 4 and 5, altering the amino acids from Ala to Arg and leaving the rest of the sequence intact. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: Changes occur in codons 4 and 5, altering the amino acids from Ala to Ser and Gly to Trp. Again, no frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: Changes occur in codons 5 and 6, altering the amino acids from Thr to Val and Ser to Thr. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.
   - **Mutant 4**: Changes occur in codons 5 and 6, altering the amino acids from Thr to Tyr and Gly to Ala. No frameshift or premature stop codon is introduced.

3. **Critical Points**:
   - None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (`TGA`, `TAG`, or `TAA`) in the middle of the sequence.
   - All mutations are point substitutions, so no frameshift occurs, and the reading frame remains intact.
   - The mutations in Mutant 4 affect two codons in the middle of the sequence, potentially disrupting a critical functional region of the protein.

### Conclusion:
While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4 disrupts two codons in the middle of the sequence, which could significantly alter the protein's structure and function. This makes Mutant 4 the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
