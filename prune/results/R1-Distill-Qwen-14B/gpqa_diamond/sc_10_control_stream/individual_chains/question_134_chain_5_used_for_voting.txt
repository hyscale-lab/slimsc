Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but I need to pay attention to the units here because the options have different units.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are acids. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So I need to consider how they react.

First, I'll write down the volumes and concentrations of each solution:

- HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when they mix, the acid and base will neutralize each other.

For HCl: Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole provides one H+ ion. So 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions. So 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Let me calculate the moles of OH- it provides. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait a minute, now I have to find out which is in excess. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is the one with the smaller moles between H+ and OH-.

H+ total is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles. But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H2O formed. I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (or sometimes around that number, like -55.8 or -56.1). But wait, that's for strong acids and strong bases. Here, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so the reaction should be exothermic.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. But in solution, the first dissociation is complete. The second one might not be, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we can assume it's fully dissociated because it's a strong acid. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

So back to the reaction. The neutralization reaction will involve H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Because the OH- is in limited supply, only some of the H+ will react.

So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles left.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Now, the enthalpy change for neutralization is the heat released when 1 mole of H2O is formed. So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 × ΔH per mole.

But wait, what's the exact value for ΔH? I recall that for strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ per mole of H2O. But sometimes it's given as -56 or -55.8. I think in some textbooks, it's -57.1 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these particular amounts are mixed. So it's the total enthalpy change for this reaction, not per mole.

So, the calculation would be moles of H2O formed multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But I have to make sure about the sign. Since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change (ΔH) will be negative.

So, moles of H2O: 0.2 moles.

ΔH = 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, my calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but the units don't match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the units. Because the standard enthalpy is usually in kJ, but the options have kcal as a unit in some choices.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, if the answer is in kcal, I'll need to convert.

Wait, let's reevaluate. Did I correctly calculate the moles of H2O formed?

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So moles of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Each mole releases 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). So 0.2 moles × (-57,000 J/mol) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

So the correct ΔH is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, but the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, and D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, my calculation gives -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles. Correct.

So OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles. So H2O is 0.2 → 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger. Hmm. Did I make a mistake elsewhere?

Wait, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry of the reaction. Let me write the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but HCl is strong acid, Ba(OH)2 is strong base.

Reaction: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula unit. So the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it would react as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Wait another approach: find the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ = 0.28 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 equivalents of OH-.

So the neutralization will require H+ and OH- to combine 1:1. So 0.2 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.28 -0.2 =0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

Thus, the moles of water formed is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Hmm, so the answer would be -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, perhaps I need to convert kJ to kcal.

Because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, to convert -11.4 kJ to kcal:

-11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's what option A is. But that can't be right because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but if the calculation is 0.2 moles of H2O, each at -57 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ total. But if the enthalpy is given per mole in kcal, then the standard value is about -28.4 kcal/mol? Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (57 /4.184).

Wait, no, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is 57 /4.184 ≈13.6 kcal. So each mole of H2O is -13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × (-13.6) ≈ -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, now I'm confused. Because the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ/mol or approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.

Wait, so if it's 0.2 moles, then 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but I thought the standard is 57 kJ/mol, which is about 13.6 kcal/mol. So 0.2 moles would give 2.72 kcal, but since it's exothermic, it's negative. So -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which would be approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because the question provides some options in kJ and others in kcal. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in both units and see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an approximate value.

Wait, the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. So the calculation is the total enthalpy change, not per mole.

Wait, but I think the mistake I made earlier is in the units. Let me recalculate using kcal.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol, which is about -13.6 kcal/mol.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Or, if using kcal: 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal) → -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would depend on which unit the question is using.

Looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So if the answer is -11.4 kJ, that's -2.72 kcal (because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which would match with the calculation if the answer is in kcal.

Alternatively, if the question expects the answer in kilojoules, then it's -11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles for each solution.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Moles of H2O formed: 0.2.

So 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match this exactly except perhaps option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake with the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just H+ + OH- → H2O, but considering the specific combinations.

Wait, another approach: write the net ionic equations.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, so it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But perhaps Ba(OH)2 is in stoichiometric excess? Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So all OH- (0.2 moles) will react with H+ to form H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28, so only 0.2 reacts, leaving 0.08.

Thus, the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is very close to 11.4 kJ in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But if the enthalpy per mole is 57 kJ, that's 57,000 J, which is 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal per mole.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.6 =2.72. So total enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal (option A).

Wait, but the units in the question are not specified. So if the answer is expected in kcal, option A is correct. If in kJ, the answer is -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thing: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 uses 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces 2 moles of H2O.

Similarly, HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Each mole of HCl uses 1 mole of OH- (since HCl is 1:1 with OH-).

Wait, but with the given volumes and concentrations, perhaps I should calculate how much each acid and base contributes.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents for H+:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq (since 1 H+ per mole).

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 eq (since 2 H+ per mole).

Total H+ eq: 0.28.

Equivalents for OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 eq (since 2 OH- per mole).

So the neutralization will proceed until the OH- is consumed. So 0.2 eq of OH- will react with 0.2 eq of H+.

But wait, wait, because H+ can come from either HCl or H2SO4. So which one reacts first?

In a mixture, the most concentrated or strongest acid might donate H+ first, but since HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also strong, they'll both donate H+ freely.

So the OH- will react with H+ from both acids until they're all used up. So the 0.2 eq OH- will react with 0.2 eq H+.

Which leaves 0.08 eq of H+ unreacted.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So ΔH = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, because 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, if it's using -55.8 kJ/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 11.16 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me check again.

Ah, wait, the volumes are in mL. Did I convert them correctly?

500 mL = 0.5 L. Correct.

300 mL = 0.3 L. Correct.

200 mL = 0.2 L. Correct.

So the moles are correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when mixing all three solutions, perhaps the neutralization isn't just between H+ and OH-, but the formation of specific salts, which may have their own enthalpy changes. But no, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the H+ and OH- combining to form water, regardless of the source acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have all the H+ from the acids neutralized by the OH- from the base, but in reality, Ba(OH)2 may require more H+.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

H+ equivalents: 0.28.

OH- equivalents:0.2.

So the OH- is limiting. So all OH- is consumed, and H+ left is 0.08.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, the enthalpy change is -57,000 J ×0.2 = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should check if the problem is asking for the total in the mixture, which includes all the solutions.

Wait, perhaps the molarity is 0.2 M for HCl, but when you mix all the solutions, the total volume changes, but the moles don't, so the molarity isn't relevant anymore. It's just the moles that matter.

So I think my earlier calculation is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just H+ + OH- → H2O, but considering the salts formed.

Wait, for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So perhaps I should calculate how much of each acid reacts with the base.

Let's see. The total equivalents of OH- is 0.2.

The H+ from HCl is 0.1 eq, and from H2SO4 is 0.18 eq.

So first, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl. HCl is a 1:1 acid.

So OH- (0.2) reacts with H+ (0.1) from HCl, using up all H+ from HCl, and leaving 0.1 eq of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.1) will react with H+ from H2SO4. Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole.

So 0.1 eq OH- will require 0.05 moles H2SO4 (since each mole gives 2 H+).

So consumed H2SO4 is 0.05 moles, and remaining H2SO4 is 0.09 -0.05 =0.04 moles.

Wait, but this approach leaves some H2SO4 unreacted.

Wait, let's calculate how much H2SO4 is needed to react with the remaining OH-.

After HCl is fully neutralized (since it's in lesser amount), the OH- left is 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole, so to neutralize 0.1 eq OH-, we need 0.05 moles H2SO4.

So the moles of H2SO4 consumed is 0.05, leaving 0.09 -0.05 =0.04 moles unreacted.

So the total moles of H2O formed would be 0.1 (from HCl and OH-) + 0.1 (from H2SO4 and remaining OH-) = 0.2 moles.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the total H2O is 0.2 moles, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Again, not matching the options.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change in the mixture, considering all the reactions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, if it's using -56.1 kJ/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 11.22 kJ, which is close to option B (-11.42 kcal).

Wait, perhaps the problem is stating the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be 11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.42 kcal is approximately 47.8 kJ, which is much higher than my calculation.

So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total volume and find the concentrations after mixing.

But no, the moles are additive, so the total H+ and OH- are as I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering all H2SO4 as contributing 2 H+ and all HCl as 1 H+, but maybe considering the stoichiometry in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the total enthalpy change regardless of the stoichiometry, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in kilocalories, so option A is correct.

Wait, because earlier I thought 0.2 moles × (-57,000 J) is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So option A would be -2.72 kcal.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would imply 47.7 kJ, which doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to choose the option that matches either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

None match my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the H2SO4 calculation.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M ×0.3 L=0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, it gives 0.18 moles H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So moles of H2O is 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the kJ options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, implying that 0.2 moles × (-57.1 kcal/mol) → but that would be 11.42 kcal, which is not possible because 57.1 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using ΔH = -57.1 kcal/mol, which is incorrect because 57.1 kcal is about 238 kJ, which is way too high.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the enthalpy in J, leading to a different value.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, so the correct option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But I'm not entirely confident because when I calculated using kJ, I didn't find a matching option. However, considering the possible unit conversion, option A would be the right choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).  
   - H₂SO₄:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).  
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Moles of H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \), and moles of OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in smaller quantity. All \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, forming \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) when converted.  
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) matches this result.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but I need to pay attention to the units here because the options have different units.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl and H2SO4 are acids. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So I need to consider how they react.

First, I'll write down the volumes and concentrations of each solution:

- HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because when they mix, the acid and base will neutralize each other.

For HCl: Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, each mole provides one H+ ion. So 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two H+ ions. So 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Let me calculate the moles of OH- it provides. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait a minute, now I have to find out which is in excess. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent is the one with the smaller moles between H+ and OH-.

H+ total is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles. But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H2O formed. I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (or sometimes around that number, like -55.8 or -56.1). But wait, that's for strong acids and strong bases. Here, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so the reaction should be exothermic.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. But in solution, the first dissociation is complete. The second one might not be, but I think for the purpose of this problem, we can assume it's fully dissociated because it's a strong acid. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+.

So back to the reaction. The neutralization reaction will involve H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Because the OH- is in limited supply, only some of the H+ will react.

So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles left.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Now, the enthalpy change for neutralization is the heat released when 1 mole of H2O is formed. So for 0.2 moles, it would be 0.2 × ΔH per mole.

But wait, what's the exact value for ΔH? I recall that for strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ per mole of H2O. But sometimes it's given as -56 or -55.8. I think in some textbooks, it's -57.1 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when these particular amounts are mixed. So it's the total enthalpy change for this reaction, not per mole.

So, the calculation would be moles of H2O formed multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

But I have to make sure about the sign. Since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change (ΔH) will be negative.

So, moles of H2O: 0.2 moles.

ΔH = 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, my calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm, but the units don't match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the units. Because the standard enthalpy is usually in kJ, but the options have kcal as a unit in some choices.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, if the answer is in kcal, I'll need to convert.

Wait, let's reevaluate. Did I correctly calculate the moles of H2O formed?

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So moles of H2O formed is 0.2 moles.

Each mole releases 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). So 0.2 moles × (-57,000 J/mol) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

So the correct ΔH is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, but the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, and D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, my calculation gives -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 moles. Correct.

So OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles. So H2O is 0.2 → 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger. Hmm. Did I make a mistake elsewhere?

Wait, maybe I should think about the stoichiometry of the reaction. Let me write the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but HCl is strong acid, Ba(OH)2 is strong base.

Reaction: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 has two OH- per formula unit. So the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it would react as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach was wrong.

Wait another approach: find the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ = 0.28 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 equivalents of OH-.

So the neutralization will require H+ and OH- to combine 1:1. So 0.2 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.28 -0.2 =0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

Thus, the moles of water formed is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Hmm, so the answer would be -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, perhaps I need to convert kJ to kcal.

Because 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, to convert -11.4 kJ to kcal:

-11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's what option A is. But that can't be right because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but if the calculation is 0.2 moles of H2O, each at -57 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ total. But if the enthalpy is given per mole in kcal, then the standard value is about -28.4 kcal/mol? Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (57 /4.184).

Wait, no, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is 57 /4.184 ≈13.6 kcal. So each mole of H2O is -13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 × (-13.6) ≈ -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

Wait, now I'm confused. Because the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ/mol or approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.

Wait, so if it's 0.2 moles, then 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but I thought the standard is 57 kJ/mol, which is about 13.6 kcal/mol. So 0.2 moles would give 2.72 kcal, but since it's exothermic, it's negative. So -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier, I thought the answer was -11.4 kJ, which would be approximately -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because the question provides some options in kJ and others in kcal. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in both units and see which option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using an approximate value.

Wait, the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. So the calculation is the total enthalpy change, not per mole.

Wait, but I think the mistake I made earlier is in the units. Let me recalculate using kcal.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol, which is about -13.6 kcal/mol.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J → -11.4 kJ.

Or, if using kcal: 0.2 × (-13.6 kcal) → -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would depend on which unit the question is using.

Looking back, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So if the answer is -11.4 kJ, that's -2.72 kcal (because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which would match with the calculation if the answer is in kcal.

Alternatively, if the question expects the answer in kilojoules, then it's -11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles for each solution.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Moles of H2O formed: 0.2.

So 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match this exactly except perhaps option D is -16 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake with the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just H+ + OH- → H2O, but considering the specific combinations.

Wait, another approach: write the net ionic equations.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4 is a diprotic strong acid, so it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, the H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But perhaps Ba(OH)2 is in stoichiometric excess? Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So all OH- (0.2 moles) will react with H+ to form H2O.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28, so only 0.2 reacts, leaving 0.08.

Thus, the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

So, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57,000 J) = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is very close to 11.4 kJ in kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But if the enthalpy per mole is 57 kJ, that's 57,000 J, which is 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal per mole.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.6 =2.72. So total enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal (option A).

Wait, but the units in the question are not specified. So if the answer is expected in kcal, option A is correct. If in kJ, the answer is -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thing: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 uses 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and produces 2 moles of H2O.

Similarly, HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

Each mole of HCl uses 1 mole of OH- (since HCl is 1:1 with OH-).

Wait, but with the given volumes and concentrations, perhaps I should calculate how much each acid and base contributes.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents for H+:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq (since 1 H+ per mole).

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 eq (since 2 H+ per mole).

Total H+ eq: 0.28.

Equivalents for OH-:

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 eq (since 2 OH- per mole).

So the neutralization will proceed until the OH- is consumed. So 0.2 eq of OH- will react with 0.2 eq of H+.

But wait, wait, because H+ can come from either HCl or H2SO4. So which one reacts first?

In a mixture, the most concentrated or strongest acid might donate H+ first, but since HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also strong, they'll both donate H+ freely.

So the OH- will react with H+ from both acids until they're all used up. So the 0.2 eq OH- will react with 0.2 eq H+.

Which leaves 0.08 eq of H+ unreacted.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So ΔH = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, because 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, if it's using -55.8 kJ/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 11.16 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles. Let me check again.

Ah, wait, the volumes are in mL. Did I convert them correctly?

500 mL = 0.5 L. Correct.

300 mL = 0.3 L. Correct.

200 mL = 0.2 L. Correct.

So the moles are correct.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when mixing all three solutions, perhaps the neutralization isn't just between H+ and OH-, but the formation of specific salts, which may have their own enthalpy changes. But no, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the H+ and OH- combining to form water, regardless of the source acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have all the H+ from the acids neutralized by the OH- from the base, but in reality, Ba(OH)2 may require more H+.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

H+ equivalents: 0.28.

OH- equivalents:0.2.

So the OH- is limiting. So all OH- is consumed, and H+ left is 0.08.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, the enthalpy change is -57,000 J ×0.2 = -11,400 J = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I should check if the problem is asking for the total in the mixture, which includes all the solutions.

Wait, perhaps the molarity is 0.2 M for HCl, but when you mix all the solutions, the total volume changes, but the moles don't, so the molarity isn't relevant anymore. It's just the moles that matter.

So I think my earlier calculation is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just H+ + OH- → H2O, but considering the salts formed.

Wait, for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

But since Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, the reaction would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So perhaps I should calculate how much of each acid reacts with the base.

Let's see. The total equivalents of OH- is 0.2.

The H+ from HCl is 0.1 eq, and from H2SO4 is 0.18 eq.

So first, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl. HCl is a 1:1 acid.

So OH- (0.2) reacts with H+ (0.1) from HCl, using up all H+ from HCl, and leaving 0.1 eq of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- (0.1) will react with H+ from H2SO4. Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole.

So 0.1 eq OH- will require 0.05 moles H2SO4 (since each mole gives 2 H+).

So consumed H2SO4 is 0.05 moles, and remaining H2SO4 is 0.09 -0.05 =0.04 moles.

Wait, but this approach leaves some H2SO4 unreacted.

Wait, let's calculate how much H2SO4 is needed to react with the remaining OH-.

After HCl is fully neutralized (since it's in lesser amount), the OH- left is 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per mole, so to neutralize 0.1 eq OH-, we need 0.05 moles H2SO4.

So the moles of H2SO4 consumed is 0.05, leaving 0.09 -0.05 =0.04 moles unreacted.

So the total moles of H2O formed would be 0.1 (from HCl and OH-) + 0.1 (from H2SO4 and remaining OH-) = 0.2 moles.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the total H2O is 0.2 moles, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Again, not matching the options.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change in the mixture, considering all the reactions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. For example, if it's using -56.1 kJ/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 11.22 kJ, which is close to option B (-11.42 kcal).

Wait, perhaps the problem is stating the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, so -11.4 kJ is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be 11.42 kcal.

Wait, but 11.42 kcal is approximately 47.8 kJ, which is much higher than my calculation.

So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total volume and find the concentrations after mixing.

But no, the moles are additive, so the total H+ and OH- are as I calculated before.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering all H2SO4 as contributing 2 H+ and all HCl as 1 H+, but maybe considering the stoichiometry in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the total enthalpy change regardless of the stoichiometry, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in kilocalories, so option A is correct.

Wait, because earlier I thought 0.2 moles × (-57,000 J) is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184≈2.72). So option A would be -2.72 kcal.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would imply 47.7 kJ, which doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to choose the option that matches either -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

None match my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the H2SO4 calculation.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M ×0.3 L=0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, it gives 0.18 moles H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M ×0.2 L=0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-. Correct.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So moles of H2O is 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the kJ options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, implying that 0.2 moles × (-57.1 kcal/mol) → but that would be 11.42 kcal, which is not possible because 57.1 kJ is about 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using ΔH = -57.1 kcal/mol, which is incorrect because 57.1 kcal is about 238 kJ, which is way too high.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the enthalpy in J, leading to a different value.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal, so the correct option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But I'm not entirely confident because when I calculated using kJ, I didn't find a matching option. However, considering the possible unit conversion, option A would be the right choice.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).  
   - H₂SO₄:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).  
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Moles of H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \), and moles of OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in smaller quantity. All \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) will react, forming \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H₂O} \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) when converted.  
   - Option A (\( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \)) matches this result.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
