Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z.

Let me think. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state's energy contributes a term to Z.

First, I should figure out all the possible states. Each spin has two possible states, so with three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

Wait, but maybe some states have the same energy? Because the energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Let me think about how the energy varies.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But since it's multiplied by -J, the energy will change accordingly.

Let me consider the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H for Hamiltonian terms.

Each S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So, H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So H can range from -3 to +3, but only in steps of 2? Wait, no. Because if all three are +1, H is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, H is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, H is -1. If all are -1, H is -3.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait no, let me calculate all possibilities.

Wait, each H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum can range as:

Max when all terms are +1: sum is 3.

If two terms are +1, one is -1: sum is 1.

If one term is +1, two are -1: sum is -1.

All terms are -1: sum is -3.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, but are all these possible? Let me think of specific states.

For H=3: All three products are +1.

Which would require S1S2 = +1 → S1=S2.

Similarly, S1S3=+1 → S1=S3.

S2S3=+1 → S2=S3.

So all spins are the same. So states like (++, +), but wait, each spin is either +1 or -1, so all three being +1 or all three being -1.

So for H=3: two possible states: all +1 or all -1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me calculate H for the state (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1).

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H = 3.

Similarly, for (-1,-1,-1), same thing: H=3.

So H=3 occurs in two states.

For H=1: Let's see when two terms are 1 and one is -1.

For example, let me pick S1=S2, S1= -S3.

So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, that gives H=-1. Hmm, maybe I need to find a state where H=1.

Wait another example: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps H=1 occurs when two of the products are +1 and one is -1.

Wait, let's try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. H=3.

What about S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. H =1 -1 -1 = -1.

Alternatively, what if S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H is S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. So H= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, that's H=-1. Hmm, maybe I should find a state where two products are 1 and one is -1.

Wait perhaps when two pairs are aligned and the third is opposite.

Wait, let me think: Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H=3.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

How about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.

Wait, so perhaps all these states give H=-1. So where does H=1 come from?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H=3.

What about S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.

Wait another approach: perhaps H=1 occurs when exactly two of the terms are +1 and one is -1.

So, the sum would be 2*(+1) + (-1) = +1.

How can that happen?

Let me think of a state where two adjacent pairs are +1, and the third is -1.

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

As before, H=1 -1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting H=1. Maybe H=1 is possible only in specific cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count the possible H values and their multiplicities.

Let me list all the 8 states and compute H for each.

The states are:

1. (+, +, +): H = 3.

2. (+, +, -): H = (1) + (-1) + (-1) → 1-1-1= -1.

3. (+, -, +): H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) → -1+1-1= -1.

4. (+, -, -): H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) → -1-1+1= -1.

5. (-, +, +): H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) → -1-1+1= -1.

6. (-, +, -): H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) → -1+1-1= -1.

7. (-, -, +): H = (1) + (-1) + (-1) →1-1-1= -1.

8. (-, -, -): H = 3.

Wait, so I just went through all 8 states. H is 3 for states 1 and 8, and H=-1 for the other six states. So H can only be 3 and -1. So I made a mistake earlier; I thought H could be 1 or -3, but it seems that's not the case.

Wait, that can't be right because when I think about it, perhaps I'm missing some states where H is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, for state 2: (+, +, -).

So S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.

State 3: (+, -, +): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 4: (+, -, -): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= +1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State 5: (-, +, +): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= +1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State 6: (-, +, -): S1S2= -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 7: (-, -, +): S1S2= +1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, so all the non-all-same states have H=-1. So H can only be 3 or -1.

So in total:

- H=3 occurs in two states: all +1 and all -1.

- H=-1 occurs in the remaining six states.

So that's the correct breakdown. So each possible energy E is given by E = -J*(H). So for H=3 → E = -3J. For H=-1 → E = J.

Wait, let me compute E again. Because E = -J*(H) → E = -J*(3) for H=3, which is E = -3J. For H=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, that can't be right. Because:

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) → E = -J H.

So if H=3 → E= -3J.

If H=-1 → E = -J*(-1) = J.

So each state in the all-same case has energy E= -3J, and all other states (six of them) have E= J.

So each of the two all-same states contributes exp(-βE) = exp(3J β), because E is -3J.

Each of the other six states contributes exp(-β * J) = exp(-J β).

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states. So for the two all-same states, each contributes e^{3Jβ}, and the other six contribute e^{-Jβ}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3 J β} + 6 * e^{-J β}.

Wait, but let me look at the options. Let's see the options again.

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our calculation says 3Jβ is positive exponent, but A has 2 with negative exponent.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → That matches our calculation.

Wait, but what about other options?

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the energy calculation? Because E = -J H. So when H=3, E=-3J. So when we compute the Boltzmann factor, it's exp(-β E) = exp(3 J β). Correct.

For H=-1, E = J. So exp(-β E) = exp(-J β). Correct.

So Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

So the correct answer would be option B.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy States
The quantity \( H = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) determines the energy. Each term \( S_i S_j \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so \( H \) can take the following values:
- \( H = 3 \): All three terms are \( +1 \). This occurs in two states: \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) = (+++, ---) \).
- \( H = -1 \): Two terms are \( -1 \) and one term is \( +1 \). This occurs in the remaining six states.

Thus, the possible energy values are:
- \( E = -J \cdot H \), so \( E = -3J \) for \( H = 3 \), and \( E = J \) for \( H = -1 \).

### Step 2: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible states. Each state contributes \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1 / (kT) \). 

- For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).
- For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are different.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients are wrong.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is given by **Option B**.

Wait, but maybe some states have the same energy? Because the energy depends on the products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Let me think about how the energy varies.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. But since it's multiplied by -J, the energy will change accordingly.

Let me consider the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H for Hamiltonian terms.

Each S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So, H is the sum of three terms, each ±1. So H can range from -3 to +3, but only in steps of 2? Wait, no. Because if all three are +1, H is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, H is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, H is -1. If all are -1, H is -3.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait no, let me calculate all possibilities.

Wait, each H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum can range as:

Max when all terms are +1: sum is 3.

If two terms are +1, one is -1: sum is 1.

If one term is +1, two are -1: sum is -1.

All terms are -1: sum is -3.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, but are all these possible? Let me think of specific states.

For H=3: All three products are +1.

Which would require S1S2 = +1 → S1=S2.

Similarly, S1S3=+1 → S1=S3.

S2S3=+1 → S2=S3.

So all spins are the same. So states like (++, +), but wait, each spin is either +1 or -1, so all three being +1 or all three being -1.

So for H=3: two possible states: all +1 or all -1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me calculate H for the state (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1).

Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. So H = 3.

Similarly, for (-1,-1,-1), same thing: H=3.

So H=3 occurs in two states.

For H=1: Let's see when two terms are 1 and one is -1.

For example, let me pick S1=S2, S1= -S3.

So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, that gives H=-1. Hmm, maybe I need to find a state where H=1.

Wait another example: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps H=1 occurs when two of the products are +1 and one is -1.

Wait, let's try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. H=3.

What about S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. H =1 -1 -1 = -1.

Alternatively, what if S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H is S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. So H= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, that's H=-1. Hmm, maybe I should find a state where two products are 1 and one is -1.

Wait perhaps when two pairs are aligned and the third is opposite.

Wait, let me think: Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H=3.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → H = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

How about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

Another state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.

Wait, so perhaps all these states give H=-1. So where does H=1 come from?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's try S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → H=3.

What about S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.

Wait another approach: perhaps H=1 occurs when exactly two of the terms are +1 and one is -1.

So, the sum would be 2*(+1) + (-1) = +1.

How can that happen?

Let me think of a state where two adjacent pairs are +1, and the third is -1.

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

As before, H=1 -1 -1 = -1.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting H=1. Maybe H=1 is possible only in specific cases.

The states are:

1. (+, +, +): H = 3.

2. (+, +, -): H = (1) + (-1) + (-1) → 1-1-1= -1.

3. (+, -, +): H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) → -1+1-1= -1.

4. (+, -, -): H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) → -1-1+1= -1.

5. (-, +, +): H = (-1) + (-1) + (1) → -1-1+1= -1.

6. (-, +, -): H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) → -1+1-1= -1.

7. (-, -, +): H = (1) + (-1) + (-1) →1-1-1= -1.

8. (-, -, -): H = 3.

Wait, so I just went through all 8 states. H is 3 for states 1 and 8, and H=-1 for the other six states. So H can only be 3 and -1. So I made a mistake earlier; I thought H could be 1 or -3, but it seems that's not the case.

Wait, that can't be right because when I think about it, perhaps I'm missing some states where H is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, for state 2: (+, +, -).

So S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.

State 3: (+, -, +): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 4: (+, -, -): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= +1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State 5: (-, +, +): S1S2 = -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= +1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State 6: (-, +, -): S1S2= -1, S1S3= +1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 7: (-, -, +): S1S2= +1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

Sum: +1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, so all the non-all-same states have H=-1. So H can only be 3 or -1.

So in total:

- H=3 occurs in two states: all +1 and all -1.

- H=-1 occurs in the remaining six states.

So that's the correct breakdown. So each possible energy E is given by E = -J*(H). So for H=3 → E = -3J. For H=-1 → E = J.

Wait, let me compute E again. Because E = -J*(H) → E = -J*(3) for H=3, which is E = -3J. For H=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, that can't be right. Because:

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) → E = -J H.

So if H=3 → E= -3J.

If H=-1 → E = -J*(-1) = J.

So each state in the all-same case has energy E= -3J, and all other states (six of them) have E= J.

So each of the two all-same states contributes exp(-βE) = exp(3J β), because E is -3J.

Each of the other six states contributes exp(-β * J) = exp(-J β).

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states. So for the two all-same states, each contributes e^{3Jβ}, and the other six contribute e^{-Jβ}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3 J β} + 6 * e^{-J β}.

Wait, but let me look at the options. Let's see the options again.

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because our calculation says 3Jβ is positive exponent, but A has 2 with negative exponent.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → That matches our calculation.

Wait, but what about other options?

Option C: 2e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the energy calculation? Because E = -J H. So when H=3, E=-3J. So when we compute the Boltzmann factor, it's exp(-β E) = exp(3 J β). Correct.

For H=-1, E = J. So exp(-β E) = exp(-J β). Correct.

So Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Looking at the options, option B is Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

So the correct answer would be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy States
The quantity \( H = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) determines the energy. Each term \( S_i S_j \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so \( H \) can take the following values:
- \( H = 3 \): All three terms are \( +1 \). This occurs in two states: \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) = (+++, ---) \).
- \( H = -1 \): Two terms are \( -1 \) and one term is \( +1 \). This occurs in the remaining six states.

Thus, the possible energy values are:
- \( E = -J \cdot H \), so \( E = -3J \) for \( H = 3 \), and \( E = J \) for \( H = -1 \).

### Step 2: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible states. Each state contributes \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1 / (kT) \). 

- For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2 \exp(3J\beta) \).
- For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6 \exp(-J\beta) \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents are different.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) — Incorrect, as the exponents and coefficients are wrong.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is given by **Option B**.

Answer: B
