Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit unusual. I remember that metrics can describe the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it's probably a 2-dimensional space since it's in terms of x and y. Oh, right, because the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a surface in hyperbolic geometry, I think.

Wait, no, pseudosphere is a term used in differential geometry. A pseudosphere usually refers to something with constant negative curvature. But wait, in general relativity, a metric can represent different kinds of spaces, like flat, spherical, or hyperbolic. The standard metrics are the flat metric, the Schwarzschild metric, etc. But this one isn't looking like Schwarzschild, so perhaps it's a 2D space with some kind of curvature.

So the metric is conformally flat because it's written as a scalar function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Conformally flat means the space is locally like flat space scaled by some function, so the angles are preserved but the lengths are scaled.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere—oh, wait, isn't a pseudosphere a surface of constant negative curvature? So, in 2D, the metric would represent hyperbolic space if it's a pseudosphere.

But wait, I'm mixing up terms here. A pseudosphere is a specific surface in 3D, but in 2D, when we talk about a space with constant negative curvature, it's called hyperbolic space. So perhaps the metric here is describing a hyperbolic plane or something similar.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface. To find the area of a pseudosphere, perhaps I need to compute the area of a region in this metric. But wait, the problem states "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, so I'm a bit confused about what "pseudosphere of radius r=2" refers to. Maybe it's a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but in the context of this metric, perhaps it's a 2D surface with a specific radius.

Wait, perhaps the metric is that of a pseudosphere. So the pseudosphere is a surface with a specific curvature. The pseudosphere has a constant negative Gaussian curvature. So for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature K would be negative. The metric given here would then have to correspond to a hyperbolic space.

In 2D, the line element for a hyperbolic space can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model, Beltrami-Klein model, etc. The Poincaré disk model has a metric of the form ds² = (4/(R² - r²)) dr² + (4/(R² - r²)) r² dθ², where r is the radial coordinate and θ is the angular coordinate. Wait, that looks similar but not exactly the same as what's given here.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see. Let me assume x and y are like polar coordinates, r² = x² + y². So then the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So that's a radial part and an angular part, each multiplied by the same conformal factor.

Comparing that to the Poincaré disk model, which in polar coordinates (r, θ) would be ds² = (4/(R² - r²)) [dr² + r² dθ²]. So in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²), which would be (R² - r²) where R² is 4. So R would be 2. And the numerator in Poincaré is 4, but here it's 32. So 32 is 8 times 4, so 8*(4/(4 - r²)) would be 32/(4 - r²). Wait, that's not matching directly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the area of a region in this metric would be. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dθ dr, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the two diagonal terms. But since it's conformally flat, the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)]? No, wait, the metric is written as diag(32/(4 - r²), 32/(4 - r²)), so the determinant g is [32/(4 - r²)]^2 * (since in polar coordinates, the line element is g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², so the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}).

Wait, no. In polar coordinates, the metric is usually ds² = g_{rr} dr² + r² g_{θθ} dθ². So the determinant is g_{rr} * r² g_{θθ}.

Wait, no, the metric in polar coordinates is generally:

ds² = g_{rr} dr² + 2 g_{rθ} dr dθ + g_{θθ} dθ².

But for a diagonal metric, g_{rθ}=0, so ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ². But in this case, the given metric is in terms of dx² + dy², which, when expressed in polar coordinates, would be dr² + r² dθ². So the given metric is multiplied by [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), so the metric tensor components are g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²) and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²), right?

Wait, wait. Because when you go from Cartesian to polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the given ds² is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So yes, the metric tensor components are g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). The determinant g is then g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the area element would be sqrt(g) dr dθ. But in this case, g is [32^2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root would be [32 r]/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait no, wait. The determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root of the determinant is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) )= (32 r)/(4 - r²) ).

So the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Hmm. So to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, I think I need to compute the area within a certain radius. Wait, but the question says the radius is r=2. Wait, in the metric, the denominator is (4 - r²), so when r² = 4, the denominator becomes zero, meaning the metric blows up. So the maximum radius in this space is 2, right? So the pseudosphere here has a radius of 2, which is the maximum possible, like the boundary where the space ends.

Wait, but in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is a surface with infinite area, because as you approach the edge, the circumference increases exponentially. But wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another model. Alternatively, the area might be finite in this specific case.

Wait, wait. So the metric is given, and the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps the pseudosphere is the entire space described by the metric. But wait, the metric has 4 - r² in the denominator, so r can't be larger than 2. So the space described by this metric is a disk of radius 2, right? Because beyond r=2, the denominator becomes negative, which would make the metric have imaginary components, which is unphysical.

So the space is a 2D surface that's a disk with radius 2. So computing the area would require integrating the area element over the entire disk.

So, the area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, integrate over θ, then over r.

The integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Then the integral over r is ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫u=4 to u=0 [32/(u)] * (-du/2).

The limits would reverse when we switch the order, so:

(32/2) ∫u=0 to u=4 (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is divergent because as u approaches 0, 1/u approaches infinity. So this integral would be 16 [ln u] from 0 to 4, which is 16 (ln 4 - ln 0). But ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln4 - (-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, which suggests that the area is infinite.

Wait, that makes sense? Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is infinite. So the total area of the disk in this metric would be infinite because the area element increases as you approach the edge (r=2), leading to an infinite total area.

So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. Converting to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the metric becomes 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, and the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) indicates that the space has a finite radius of 2, as the denominator \(4 - r^2\) becomes zero at \(r = 2\). Beyond \(r = 2\), the metric becomes unphysical due to the denominator becoming negative.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element in this metric. The determinant of the metric tensor is 

\[
g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The square root of the determinant gives the area element:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the entire disk:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. For the radial integral, we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln u\), and \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Thus, the total area is infinite.

This result aligns with the properties of hyperbolic space, where the area of a pseudosphere is infinite due to the exponential increase in the circumference as one approaches the boundary.

**Conclusion:** The area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the two diagonal terms. But since it's conformally flat, the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32/(4 - r²)]? No, wait, the metric is written as diag(32/(4 - r²), 32/(4 - r²)), so the determinant g is [32/(4 - r²)]^2 * (since in polar coordinates, the line element is g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², so the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}).

Wait, no. In polar coordinates, the metric is usually ds² = g_{rr} dr² + r² g_{θθ} dθ². So the determinant is g_{rr} * r² g_{θθ}.

So the given metric is multiplied by [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), so the metric tensor components are g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²) and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²), right?

Wait, wait. Because when you go from Cartesian to polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the given ds² is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So yes, the metric tensor components are g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). The determinant g is then g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So the area element would be sqrt(g) dr dθ. But in this case, g is [32^2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root would be [32 r]/(4 - r²). So the area element is [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait no, wait. The determinant is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root of the determinant is sqrt( (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) )= (32 r)/(4 - r²) ).

So the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Hmm. So to find the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2, I think I need to compute the area within a certain radius. Wait, but the question says the radius is r=2.

So the space is a 2D surface that's a disk with radius 2. So computing the area would require integrating the area element over the entire disk.

So, the area A would be the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2, of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. First, integrate over θ, then over r.

The integral over θ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Then the integral over r is ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫u=4 to u=0 [32/(u)] * (-du/2).

The limits would reverse when we switch the order, so:

(32/2) ∫u=0 to u=4 (1/u) du.

Which is 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

But wait, the integral of 1/u from 0 to 4 is divergent because as u approaches 0, 1/u approaches infinity. So this integral would be 16 [ln u] from 0 to 4, which is 16 (ln 4 - ln 0). But ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln4 - (-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, which suggests that the area is infinite.

Wait, that makes sense? Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere is infinite. So the total area of the disk in this metric would be infinite because the area element increases as you approach the edge (r=2), leading to an infinite total area.

So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. Converting to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the metric becomes 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, and the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\) indicates that the space has a finite radius of 2, as the denominator \(4 - r^2\) becomes zero at \(r = 2\). Beyond \(r = 2\), the metric becomes unphysical due to the denominator becoming negative.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element in this metric. The determinant of the metric tensor is 

\[
g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The square root of the determinant gives the area element:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the entire disk:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) is straightforward. For the radial integral, we use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

This integral diverges because \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln u\), and \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). Thus, the total area is infinite.

This result aligns with the properties of hyperbolic space, where the area of a pseudosphere is infinite due to the exponential increase in the circumference as one approaches the boundary.

**Conclusion:** The area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
