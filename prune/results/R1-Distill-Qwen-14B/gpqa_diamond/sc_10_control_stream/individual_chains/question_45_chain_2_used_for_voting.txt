Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is the ground state energy for n=1.

Wait, but wait. Since the particles are identical and spin-1/2, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. But in this case, since they are in a one-dimensional well, the quantum numbers are just n. So each particle must have a different n, right?

Wait, no. Wait, in one dimension, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. Oh right! For spin-1/2 particles, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with the same n but different spins. So for each n, maximum two fermions can occupy that state.

So with four particles, we can have two in n=1 (each with opposite spins), two in n=2, but wait— wait, wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, no. Wait, each n can hold two particles, because spin up and spin down. So for four particles, the first two would go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), then the next two would go into n=2, each with spin up and down. But wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for four particles, the first two are in n=1 (two spins), the next two would be in n=2, each with their two spins. So then, all four are filled up to n=2?

Wait, but no. Let's think about how fermions fill up the states. In the ground state, the lowest energy state is n=1, which can hold two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold two more. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state is n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2.

Wait, but wait, but each particle is in a state, so the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Each has energy E_n = n² E, where E is the given base energy (E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²)).

So for the ground state: two particles in n=1, two in n=2. So the energies are 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. So the total energy is 2*(1)E + 2*(4)E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, wait—no. Wait, because each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E, so two of them give 2E. Similarly, each in n=2 gives 4E, so two of them give 8E. So total is 10E.

But wait, wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Wait no, the question is about the energies of the system, not the individual particles. So the total energy of the system is the sum of each particle's energy. So for the ground state, it's 10E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount: each of the two in n=1 gives E, so 2E. Each of the two in n=2 gives 4E, so 8E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E? But wait, that doesn't match the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E.

Option B: 4E, 10E,50E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So perhaps each of those states refers to the total energy, not the individual energies. So I need to find what the total energy is for each of these states.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are arranged as n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But wait, looking at the options, option C and B have 10E as one of the options. But let's think: the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state. What's the first excited state?

Ah, wait. The first excited state would be the next possible state where the particles are arranged in higher energy levels. So how do the particles arrange themselves beyond the ground state?

In the ground state, the particles are filled up to n=2. The next arrangement would be to promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, maybe the first excited state has one particle in n=3.

Wait, but the particles are fermions, so they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So to get the next state beyond the ground state, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. Let's see.

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 10E.

First excited state: Maybe one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So now the particles are n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energies would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) +1*(9E) (n=3). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but that's 15E. So the first excited state would have total energy 15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. Let's say another from n=2 to n=3, but wait, no, because each n can have two particles. Wait, no, in the ground state, n=2 has two particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps we have n=2 with one particle, n=3 with one. Now, to get the next state, perhaps both particles in n=2 are promoted, but that would mean two particles in n=3. Let me think. Or perhaps another scenario.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), as I thought earlier, giving total energy 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Because n=2 had two particles in the ground state, now both have moved to n=3. So the energies would be 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*(9E) (n=3) = 2E + 18E =20E. Wait, but that would be 20E, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=2, but with one particle promoted to n=3, and another to a higher state? Or perhaps another arrangement.

Wait, wait, perhaps the first excited state has one particle in n=3, and the others as before. So, the energies would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) + another E from n=2? Wait, no. Wait, the four particles: in ground state, it's two in n=1 and two in n=2. So in first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

So the total energy would be 2*(1)E +1*(4)E +1*(9)E = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making two in n=3, and zero in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(1)E + 0*(4)E + 2*(9)E = 2E +18E =20E.

But wait, 20E isn't one of the options. The options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B) 4E, 10E,50E

C) 4E, 10E, 15E

D) 10E, 15E, 18E

Wait, so my calculation for the second excited state is 20E, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), leading to 15E. Then the second excited state could be when another particle from n=1 moves to n=3, but wait, that's not possible because n=3 can have two particles. Or perhaps it's when one particle is promoted to n=4.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's what I thought earlier. Let me try to think in terms of the possible energies.

Wait, another approach: the possible states are determined by the distribution of the four particles in the available n's, respecting the Pauli exclusion.

Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, so for each n, up to two particles can be present (due to spin up and down).

So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Sum is 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making n=3 have two particles, and n=2 empty. So sum is 2E +0 +18E=20E. But 20E's not an option, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when another n=1 particle moves to n=3, but that would require that n=1 has only one particle left. Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 has two. So if one moves to n=3, then n=1 has one, n=3 has one, but that might not be allowed. Wait, no, because each n can have two particles. So, perhaps the first excited state could be when one of the n=1 particles moves to n=3, but that would be higher in energy. Let's calculate that.

If in the first excited state, n=1 has one particle (E), n=2 has two (4E each), and n=3 has one (9E). So the sum is E + 8E +9E=18E. But wait, that's 18E, which is an option (option D says 10, 15, 18). Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the order of the energies. The ground state is 10E, as per the initial calculation. The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy state. So which arrangement gives the next lowest sum after 10E?

Option 1: 2 particles at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=3. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Option 2: 1 at n=1, 2 at n=2, 1 at n=3. Sum is E +8E +9E=18E.

Which of these is lower? 15E is lower than 18E, so the first excited state would be 15E, second excited state would be 18E.

Wait, but let me think: is there another possible arrangement with a sum between 10E and 15E? Let's see.

Another possible arrangement: what if one particle is at n=3, and the others remain as in ground state except one at n=2 moves up? No, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another to n=4. But that would be higher than the first option.

Wait, so if the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited state would be moving another particle, say from n=2 to n=3, so now n=3 has two particles, n=2 has zero, and n=1 has two. Sum is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look at the possible order of energies.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Hmm, that would be higher than 15E, so perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Each n=3 has two particles. So the sum is 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E. So 15E is the first excited state, 20E second.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the fermions can have other quantum numbers beyond n. Wait, in 1D infinite well, the quantum number is just n, so each state is determined by n and spin. So each n can have two particles, as discussed.

But maybe the question is about the system's energy, which is the sum of all individual energies. So let's consider all possible arrangements and compute their total energies.

So for four particles, possible distributions:

1. All in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Sum: 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2+8=10E.

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2+4+9=15E.

3. 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum: 2*1 + 0 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

4. 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 1+8 +9=18E.

5. 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum:1 +4 + 18=23E.

6. 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum:0 + 8+18=26E.

7. Other distributions, like 1 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 3 in n=3— but wait, no, because each n can have only two particles.

Wait, so the possible sums are 10,15,18,20,23,26, etc. But the options are 10E,15E,18E in option D, and others.

Wait, the question is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is 10E. The first excited state is the next lowest, which is 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next, which is 18E, because 18 is the next after 15.

Because the other option is 20E, which is higher than 18E, so 18E would come before 20E in the ordering.

So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

Looking at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So that must be the correct option.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Here, \(n\) is the quantum number, and the energy increases quadratically with \(n\).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. However, for each \(n\), two particles can occupy the same \(n\) with opposite spins (spin-up and spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\) (each with opposite spins).  
   - Two particles in \(n=2\) (each with opposite spins).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), leaving one particle in \(n=2\) and one in \(n=3\). The configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\).  
   - One particle in \(n=2\).  
   - One particle in \(n=3\).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), leaving no particles in \(n=2\) and two particles in \(n=3\). The configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\).  
   - Two particles in \(n=3\).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]  
   However, this value does not match the provided options. Reconsidering the possible configurations, the second excited state could correspond to a different arrangement where the energy is \(18E\), as listed in the options.

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \(30E, 39E, 50E\) — These values are too high and inconsistent with the calculated energies.  
   - **Option B**: \(4E, 10E, 50E\) — The value \(4E\) is incorrect for the ground state.  
   - **Option C**: \(4E, 10E, 15E\) — The value \(4E\) is incorrect for the ground state.  
   - **Option D**: \(10E, 15E, 18E\) — Matches the calculated energies for the ground state (\(10E\)), first excited state (\(15E\)), and second excited state (\(18E\)).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option D**.  

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is the ground state energy for n=1.

Wait, but wait. Since the particles are identical and spin-1/2, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. But in this case, since they are in a one-dimensional well, the quantum numbers are just n. So each particle must have a different n, right?

Wait, no. Wait, in one dimension, the quantum state is determined by n and spin. Oh right! For spin-1/2 particles, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with the same n but different spins. So for each n, maximum two fermions can occupy that state.

So with four particles, we can have two in n=1 (each with opposite spins), two in n=2, but wait— wait, wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, no. Wait, each n can hold two particles, because spin up and spin down. So for four particles, the first two would go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), then the next two would go into n=2, each with spin up and down. But wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for four particles, the first two are in n=1 (two spins), the next two would be in n=2, each with their two spins. So then, all four are filled up to n=2?

Wait, but no. Let's think about how fermions fill up the states. In the ground state, the lowest energy state is n=1, which can hold two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold two more. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state is n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2.

Wait, but wait, but each particle is in a state, so the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies. Each has energy E_n = n² E, where E is the given base energy (E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²)).

So for the ground state: two particles in n=1, two in n=2. So the energies are 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. So the total energy is 2*(1)E + 2*(4)E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, wait—no. Wait, because each of the two particles in n=1 contributes E, so two of them give 2E. Similarly, each in n=2 gives 4E, so two of them give 8E. So total is 10E.

But wait, wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Wait no, the question is about the energies of the system, not the individual particles. So the total energy of the system is the sum of each particle's energy. So for the ground state, it's 10E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount: each of the two in n=1 gives E, so 2E. Each of the two in n=2 gives 4E, so 8E. So total is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E? But wait, that doesn't match the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E.

Option B: 4E, 10E,50E.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So perhaps each of those states refers to the total energy, not the individual energies. So I need to find what the total energy is for each of these states.

Wait, but in the ground state, the four particles are arranged as n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles). So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

But wait, looking at the options, option C and B have 10E as one of the options. But let's think: the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state. What's the first excited state?

Ah, wait. The first excited state would be the next possible state where the particles are arranged in higher energy levels. So how do the particles arrange themselves beyond the ground state?

In the ground state, the particles are filled up to n=2. The next arrangement would be to promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, maybe the first excited state has one particle in n=3.

Wait, but the particles are fermions, so they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So to get the next state beyond the ground state, perhaps one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3. Let's see.

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 10E.

First excited state: Maybe one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So now the particles are n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energies would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*(4E) (n=2) +1*(9E) (n=3). So total energy is 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but that's 15E. So the first excited state would have total energy 15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. Let's say another from n=2 to n=3, but wait, no, because each n can have two particles. Wait, no, in the ground state, n=2 has two particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps we have n=2 with one particle, n=3 with one. Now, to get the next state, perhaps both particles in n=2 are promoted, but that would mean two particles in n=3. Let me think. Or perhaps another scenario.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), as I thought earlier, giving total energy 15E. The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted. So perhaps n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). Because n=2 had two particles in the ground state, now both have moved to n=3. So the energies would be 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*(9E) (n=3) = 2E + 18E =20E. Wait, but that would be 20E, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let's think differently. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest occupied state is n=2, but with one particle promoted to n=3, and another to a higher state? Or perhaps another arrangement.

Wait, wait, perhaps the first excited state has one particle in n=3, and the others as before. So, the energies would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) + another E from n=2? Wait, no. Wait, the four particles: in ground state, it's two in n=1 and two in n=2. So in first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So now, we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

So the total energy would be 2*(1)E +1*(4)E +1*(9)E = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle moves up. So perhaps another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making two in n=3, and zero in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(1)E + 0*(4)E + 2*(9)E = 2E +18E =20E.

But wait, 20E isn't one of the options. The options given are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B) 4E, 10E,50E

C) 4E, 10E, 15E

D) 10E, 15E, 18E

Wait, so my calculation for the second excited state is 20E, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), leading to 15E. Then the second excited state could be when another particle from n=1 moves to n=3, but wait, that's not possible because n=3 can have two particles. Or perhaps it's when one particle is promoted to n=4.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's what I thought earlier. Let me try to think in terms of the possible energies.

Wait, another approach: the possible states are determined by the distribution of the four particles in the available n's, respecting the Pauli exclusion.

Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, so for each n, up to two particles can be present (due to spin up and down).

So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Sum is 2E + 8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state could be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making n=3 have two particles, and n=2 empty. So sum is 2E +0 +18E=20E. But 20E's not an option, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when another n=1 particle moves to n=3, but that would require that n=1 has only one particle left. Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 has two. So if one moves to n=3, then n=1 has one, n=3 has one, but that might not be allowed. Wait, no, because each n can have two particles. So, perhaps the first excited state could be when one of the n=1 particles moves to n=3, but that would be higher in energy. Let's calculate that.

If in the first excited state, n=1 has one particle (E), n=2 has two (4E each), and n=3 has one (9E). So the sum is E + 8E +9E=18E. But wait, that's 18E, which is an option (option D says 10, 15, 18). Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the order of the energies. The ground state is 10E, as per the initial calculation. The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy state. So which arrangement gives the next lowest sum after 10E?

Option 1: 2 particles at n=1, 1 at n=2, 1 at n=3. Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Option 2: 1 at n=1, 2 at n=2, 1 at n=3. Sum is E +8E +9E=18E.

Which of these is lower? 15E is lower than 18E, so the first excited state would be 15E, second excited state would be 18E.

Wait, but let me think: is there another possible arrangement with a sum between 10E and 15E? Let's see.

Another possible arrangement: what if one particle is at n=3, and the others remain as in ground state except one at n=2 moves up? No, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another to n=4. But that would be higher than the first option.

Wait, so if the first excited state is 15E, then the second excited state would be moving another particle, say from n=2 to n=3, so now n=3 has two particles, n=2 has zero, and n=1 has two. Sum is 2E + 0 + 18E = 20E. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look at the possible order of energies.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. Hmm, that would be higher than 15E, so perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=3 (2). Each n=3 has two particles. So the sum is 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E. So 15E is the first excited state, 20E second.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the fermions can have other quantum numbers beyond n. Wait, in 1D infinite well, the quantum number is just n, so each state is determined by n and spin. So each n can have two particles, as discussed.

But maybe the question is about the system's energy, which is the sum of all individual energies. So let's consider all possible arrangements and compute their total energies.

So for four particles, possible distributions:

1. All in n=1 and n=2: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. Sum: 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2+8=10E.

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2+4+9=15E.

3. 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum: 2*1 + 0 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

4. 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 1+8 +9=18E.

5. 1 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum:1 +4 + 18=23E.

6. 0 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum:0 + 8+18=26E.

7. Other distributions, like 1 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 3 in n=3— but wait, no, because each n can have only two particles.

Wait, so the possible sums are 10,15,18,20,23,26, etc. But the options are 10E,15E,18E in option D, and others.

Wait, the question is to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So the ground state is the lowest energy, which is 10E. The first excited state is the next lowest, which is 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next, which is 18E, because 18 is the next after 15.

Because the other option is 20E, which is higher than 18E, so 18E would come before 20E in the ordering.

So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited).

Looking at the options, option D says 10E, 15E, 18E. So that must be the correct option.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Here, \(n\) is the quantum number, and the energy increases quadratically with \(n\).

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. However, for each \(n\), two particles can occupy the same \(n\) with opposite spins (spin-up and spin-down).

3. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\) (each with opposite spins).  
   - Two particles in \(n=2\) (each with opposite spins).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

4. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), leaving one particle in \(n=2\) and one in \(n=3\). The configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\).  
   - One particle in \(n=2\).  
   - One particle in \(n=3\).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

5. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), leaving no particles in \(n=2\) and two particles in \(n=3\). The configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \(n=1\).  
   - Two particles in \(n=3\).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]  
   However, this value does not match the provided options. Reconsidering the possible configurations, the second excited state could correspond to a different arrangement where the energy is \(18E\), as listed in the options.

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \(30E, 39E, 50E\) — These values are too high and inconsistent with the calculated energies.  
   - **Option B**: \(4E, 10E, 50E\) — The value \(4E\) is incorrect for the ground state.  
   - **Option C**: \(4E, 10E, 15E\) — The value \(4E\) is incorrect for the ground state.  
   - **Option D**: \(10E, 15E, 18E\) — Matches the calculated energies for the ground state (\(10E\)), first excited state (\(15E\)), and second excited state (\(18E\)).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option D**.
