Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So we need to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and velocity. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m0 c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So let's compute gamma for v=0.96c. Let me write that down:

v = 0.96c
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me get more precise. 0.28 * 3 is 0.84, 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, which is close to 1. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is exactly 1. So gamma is 3.57142857 approximately.

Next, I think I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass number and the mass of a nucleon. Wait, but lithium-6 is a specific isotope, so maybe I should look up its exact rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass can be approximated as the number of nucleons times the mass of a proton, but wait, the mass of a neutron is slightly different. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately A times the mass of a proton, but considering that the binding energy and other factors, but perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach where the rest mass is taken as A times the nucleon mass.

Wait, let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and similarly for a neutron (about 939.56 MeV/c², but maybe approximated as the same as the proton for rough calculations). Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

Wait, another approach: the mass of Li-6 can be calculated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01516 u (unified atomic mass units). I think I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that to GeV, 931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV.

So m = 6.01516 u * 0.9315 GeV/u. Let me compute that.

First compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

But wait, 6.01516 is a bit more than 6, so 0.01516 * 0.9315 = approx 0.01408 GeV. So total m ≈ 5.589 + 0.01408 ≈ 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I think the exact calculation would be better. Let me compute 6.01516 * 0.9315.

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.01516 * 0.9315 = let's see: 0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315, and 0.00516 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.004813. So sum is 0.009315 + 0.004813 ≈ 0.014128. So total m ≈ 5.589 + 0.014128 ≈ 5.6031 GeV/c².

But wait, I'm not sure if Li-6's atomic mass is exactly 6.01516 u. Let me think: the exact mass is around that. I think I can proceed with that value for now.

So the rest mass energy is m c², which is 5.6031 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c².

Gamma we found as approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 GeV is 17.857 GeV.

3.5714 * 0.6031 GeV:

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.0031 ≈ 0.01107

So summing 2.14284 + 0.01107 ≈ 2.15391 GeV.

So total E ≈ 17.857 + 2.15391 ≈ 20.0109 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute 3.5714 *5.6031.

Let me do it step by step.

5.6031 *3 = 16.8093

5.6031 *0.5 = 2.80155

5.6031 *0.07 = 0.392217

5.6031 *0.0014 ≈ 0.007844

So sum: 16.8093 + 2.80155 = 19.61085

+ 0.392217 = 20.003067

+ 0.007844 = 20.010911 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but perhaps my approximation for the mass is off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01516 u. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is actually 6.01516 * (931.5 MeV/u) converted to GeV.

Wait, 6.01516 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV

0.01516 *931.5 ≈ 14.12 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.12= 5603.12 MeV, which is 5.60312 GeV.

So that seems correct.

So E= gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.60312.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.60312.

Hmm, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.60312.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.00312=?

Wait, 0.00312 is 3.12e-3.

3.57142857 * 0.00312 = approx:

3.57142857 *3 =10.71428571e-3 → 0.01071428571

3.57142857 *0.12e-3 → 0.0004285714264

Total for 0.00312: 0.01071428571 + 0.0004285714264 ≈ 0.01114285714.

So summing up all parts:

17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20.000000 (since 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20 exactly).

Adding the 0.01114285714 gives 20.011142857 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than 20.011. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

v = 0.96c.

So (v/c) =0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the gamma value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the calculation to account for the fact that the nucleus is moving, but perhaps the energy is per nucleon? No, the problem says the energy of the nucleus.

Wait another thought: the problem says 'energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c'. So RHIC accelerates the nucleus to that speed, so the total energy is the relativistic energy of the nucleus.

So everything so far seems correct.

But according to my calculation, the answer is approximately 20.011 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the mass of Li-6. Maybe I used the wrong isotope. Wait, X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01516 u.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is in terms of the nucleon mass. So the mass of Li-6 is 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV/c².

But wait, no. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but in this case, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as 6 * m_n, where m_n is the neutron mass, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the mass is given as the number of nucleons times the average mass of a nucleon.

Wait, but the standard approach is to use the rest mass of the nucleus. So perhaps I should use the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking up the exact value, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01516 u.

So, 6.01516 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that more precisely.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01516 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.00516 *931.5= approx 4.814.

So 9.315 +4.814=14.129 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.129=5603.129 MeV, which is 5.603129 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.603129 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.603129.

Let me do this calculation precisely.

3.57142857 *5.603129.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603129 =16.809387

0.5*5.603129=2.8015645

0.07142857 *5.603129.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 3.57142857 *5.603129 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps we can compute this step by step.

3.57142857 *5.603129 = ?

I'll compute it as:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.003129 ≈ ?

Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.003129.

0.003 is 3.57142857 * 0.003 = 0.0107142857.

0.000129 is 3.57142857 *0.000129 ≈ 0.0004612747.

Adding them: 0.0107142857 +0.0004612747 ≈ 0.01117556.

So summing all parts:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.000000 (since 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20 exactly).

Adding the 0.01117556 gives 20.01117556 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm, that's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake?

Wait another thought: perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me recalculate gamma.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is different. Wait, Li-6 has a mass of 6.01516 u, so 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6 * 931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01516 *931.5 = let me compute more accurately.

0.01516 ×931.5:

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005*931.5=4.6575.

0.00016 *931.5=0.14904.

So sum is 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 + 0.14904=14.12154 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5589 +14.12154=5603.12154 MeV=5.60312154 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.60312154.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this multiplication precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60312154.

Let me think of 3.57142857 as 25/7 (since 25/7≈3.57142857).

So 25/7 *5.60312154.

25/7 *5 = 125/7=17.857142857.

25/7 *0.60312154 = ?

0.60312154 *25 =15.0780385.

15.0780385 /7 = approx 2.1540055.

So summing 17.857142857 +2.1540055 =20.011148357 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0111 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. But that's higher. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus's mass is actually higher because it's a charged particle and maybe some other factor? Or perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, let me compute gamma using more precise calculation.

v=0.96c.

beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

That's precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, not the kinetic.

Ah! Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total energy is gamma * m c². But sometimes, in problems, when people refer to the energy imparted by the collider, they might be referring to the kinetic energy. Wait, but in this case, RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain speed, so the energy is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, assuming the nucleus is made of A nucleons each with mass m_n, but that's not correct because the nucleus's rest mass is less than A times the nucleon mass due to binding energy. So perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as A times the proton mass.

Wait, but let me compute the mass of Li-6 as 6 * m_p, where m_p is 938 MeV/c².

6 * 938 = 5,628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628= ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857= 0.09999999 (approx 0.1).

So 2.14285714 +0.09999999≈2.24285713.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.24285713≈20.1 GeV.

Ah! That's about 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the rest mass is A * m_p.

Hmm, so using 6 * 938 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628 accurately.

5.628 =5 +0.628.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628 = let's compute it step by step.

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.02 *3.57142857=0.0714285714.

0.008 *3.57142857=0.02857142856.

Adding those: 2.142857142 + 0.0714285714 =2.2142857134 +0.02857142856≈2.242857142 GeV.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.242857142 =20.100 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is close.

But why the discrepancy? Because the actual mass of Li-6 is about 5.603 GeV, but when using 6 *938, it's 5.628 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation where the mass is A * m_p, which is 5.628 GeV.

Thus, E= 3.57142857 *5.628 = approx 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's precise.

So using m =5.628 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628 = ?

Again, 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.02 =0.0714285714.

3.57142857 *0.008 =0.02857142856.

Adding those gives 2.142857142 +0.0714285714 =2.2142857134 +0.02857142856 =2.24285714196.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.24285714196 =20.10000 (since 17.85714285 +2.24285714196=20.100000).

Wait, but 17.85714285 + 2.24285714196 is exactly 20.10000.

So why is option C 20.132 GeV? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 * m_p, which is 6 *938 =5628 MeV=5.628 GeV, as I did before.

So using that, E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132, which is 0.032 GeV higher. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately using more precise values.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

Wait, 5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.628 *4/7 = (5.628 *4)/7 =22.512/7 ≈3.216.

So total would be 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, no, the question says 'energy of the RHIC' which is the total energy. But if I'm not mistaken, sometimes in particle physics, when you talk about the energy imparted by a collider, you're talking about the kinetic energy, not the total. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think. The total energy is gamma * m c². The kinetic energy is (gamma-1)*m c².

If the problem asks for the total energy, then my initial approach is correct. But perhaps the question is referring to kinetic energy, which would be 20.1 -5.628 =14.472 GeV. But none of the options are that low.

Wait, the options are all above 18 GeV, so that can't be. Thus, the initial approach must be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is 6.01516 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.01516 *931.5 =5603.12 MeV =5.60312 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60312 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60312 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00312 *3.57142857=0.01114285714.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.01114285714=2.15400 GeV.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.154 =20.01114285 GeV.

Which is about 20.011 GeV.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass of lithium-6, which includes electrons. Because the nucleus is Li-6, but the atomic mass includes electrons.

Wait a second! Oh, I think I made a mistake here. The mass I used was the atomic mass, which includes electrons. But the nucleus is Li-6, so I should subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, yes. Because when we talk about the nucleus, it's only protons and neutrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

So for Li-6, which has 3 electrons, because Li has atomic number 3.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01516 u, but the nucleus is 6.01516 u minus 3 * m_e, where m_e is the electron mass, which is about 0.00054858 u.

So the nucleus mass is:

6.01516 u - 3 *0.00054858 u.

Compute 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01516 -0.00164574 =6.01351426 u.

Then, converting to GeV: 6.01351426 u * 931.5 MeV/u =6.01351426 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01351426 *931.5 MeV.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00351426 *931.5= approx 3.264 MeV.

So total is 9.315 +3.264=12.579 MeV.

So total nucleus mass energy is 5589 +12.579=5601.579 MeV =5.601579 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601579 GeV.

Compute this.

3.57142857 *5.601579.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.601579 =16.804737.

0.57142857 *5.601579.

0.5 *5.601579=2.8007895.

0.07142857 *5.601579 ≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, plus 0.07142857 *0.601579≈0.043.

So about 0.35714285 +0.043=0.40014285.

So 0.57142857 *5.601579 ≈2.8007895 +0.40014285≈3.20093235.

So total E=16.804737 +3.20093235≈20.005669 GeV.

Approximately 20.0057 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleon as 938 MeV/c², so the nucleus mass would be 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV=20.100 GeV.

Which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of more precise values for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation error in gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.571428571.

But perhaps the exact value is a bit more precise.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.571428571.

But perhaps the actual calculation uses more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) with more precision.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: exact value is 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no error there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.601579 more accurately.

Let me compute 5.601579 *3.57142857.

I'll compute 5.601579 *3.57142857:

Break it into 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.601579 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.001579 *3.57142857≈0.005632.

So 0.601579 *3.57142857≈2.142857142 +0.005632=2.148489 GeV.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.148489≈20.00563185 GeV≈20.0056 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic energy formula with more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the exact formula, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but I don't think so because the options are in GeV, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton plus neutron, i.e., m_p + m_n, but that doesn't make much sense for the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is considered as consisting of 6 nucleons, each with mass m_n, but that's not correct because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Maybe the average mass per nucleon is used.

But I think I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that my calculation using the correct nucleus mass gives about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is 6.01516 u. But when considering the nucleus, we subtract the electrons.

Li has 3 electrons. So the nucleus mass is 6.01516 u - 3 * m_e.

m_e is approximately 0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01516 -0.00164574=6.01351426 u.

Converting to GeV:

6.01351426 u * 931.5 MeV/u =6.01351426 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01351426 *931.5= let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00351426 *931.5.

0.003 *931.5=2.7945 MeV.

0.00051426 *931.5≈0.479 MeV.

So 2.7945 +0.479=3.2735 MeV.

Adding to 9.315 →9.315 +3.2735=12.5885 MeV.

Total is 5589 +12.5885=5601.5885 MeV=5.6015885 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6015885 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6015885.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0015885 *3.57142857≈0.005675.

So 0.6015885*3.57142857≈2.142857142 + 0.005675≈2.148532.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.148532≈20.00567485 GeV.

Still around 20.0057 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is treated as a particle whose rest mass is the sum of the constituent nucleons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of a proton: ~938.272 MeV/c².

Mass of a neutron: ~939.565 MeV/c².

So total mass of Li-6 nucleus would be 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Wait, wait. No, because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*(938.272+939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511= ?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511= let's compute:

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈0.012535.

So sum: 0.107142857 +0.012535≈0.119677857.

So 3.57142857 *0.633511 ≈2.142857142 +0.119677857≈2.262535 GeV.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.262535≈20.11967785 GeV.

Approximately 20.12 GeV.

Which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be calculated as the sum of the individual nucleons, not subtracting the electrons. So using 5.6335 GeV as the rest mass.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6335 ≈20.1197 GeV → approximately 20.12 GeV.

Which matches option C) 20.132 GeV very closely.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01516 \, \text{u} \). Since the nucleus excludes electrons, we subtract the mass of 3 electrons (\( 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \)):

\[
\text{Nucleus mass} = 6.01516 - 0.00164574 = 6.01351426 \, \text{u}
\]

Converting to GeV using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \):

\[
m = 6.01351426 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5601.5885 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6015885 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6015885 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6015885 \approx 2.148532 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.148532 \approx 20.00567485 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using nucleon masses
If the rest mass is approximated as the sum of individual nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), with \( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the total rest mass is:

\[
m = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Recomputing the total energy:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.633511 \approx 2.262535 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.262535 \approx 20.11967785 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated energy aligns closely with option **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is consistent with the assumption of approximating the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleons. 

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So we need to find the energy of RHIC such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and velocity. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m0 c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So let's compute gamma for v=0.96c. Let me write that down:

v = 0.96c
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me get more precise. 0.28 * 3 is 0.84, 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98, which is close to 1. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is exactly 1. So gamma is 3.57142857 approximately.

Next, I think I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass number and the mass of a nucleon. Wait, but lithium-6 is a specific isotope, so maybe I should look up its exact rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass can be approximated as the number of nucleons times the mass of a proton, but wait, the mass of a neutron is slightly different. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately A times the mass of a proton, but considering that the binding energy and other factors, but perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach where the rest mass is taken as A times the nucleon mass.

Wait, let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and similarly for a neutron (about 939.56 MeV/c², but maybe approximated as the same as the proton for rough calculations). Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the mass of Li-6 in GeV/c².

Wait, another approach: the mass of Li-6 can be calculated using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01516 u (unified atomic mass units). I think I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So converting that to GeV, 931.5 MeV is 0.9315 GeV.

So m = 6.01516 u * 0.9315 GeV/u. Let me compute that.

First compute 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

But wait, 6.01516 is a bit more than 6, so 0.01516 * 0.9315 = approx 0.01408 GeV. So total m ≈ 5.589 + 0.01408 ≈ 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I think the exact calculation would be better. Let me compute 6.01516 * 0.9315.

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.01516 * 0.9315 = let's see: 0.01 * 0.9315 = 0.009315, and 0.00516 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.004813. So sum is 0.009315 + 0.004813 ≈ 0.014128. So total m ≈ 5.589 + 0.014128 ≈ 5.6031 GeV/c².

But wait, I'm not sure if Li-6's atomic mass is exactly 6.01516 u. Let me think: the exact mass is around that. I think I can proceed with that value for now.

So the rest mass energy is m c², which is 5.6031 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c².

Gamma we found as approximately 3.5714. So E = 3.5714 * 5.6031 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 GeV is 17.857 GeV.

3.5714 * 0.6031 GeV:

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.0031 ≈ 0.01107

So summing 2.14284 + 0.01107 ≈ 2.15391 GeV.

So total E ≈ 17.857 + 2.15391 ≈ 20.0109 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute 3.5714 *5.6031.

Let me do it step by step.

5.6031 *3 = 16.8093

5.6031 *0.5 = 2.80155

5.6031 *0.07 = 0.392217

5.6031 *0.0014 ≈ 0.007844

So sum: 16.8093 + 2.80155 = 19.61085

+ 0.392217 = 20.003067

+ 0.007844 = 20.010911 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but perhaps my approximation for the mass is off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01516 u. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is actually 6.01516 * (931.5 MeV/u) converted to GeV.

Wait, 6.01516 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV

0.01516 *931.5 ≈ 14.12 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.12= 5603.12 MeV, which is 5.60312 GeV.

So that seems correct.

So E= gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.60312.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this with more precision.

3.57142857 *5.60312.

Hmm, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.60312.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.00312=?

Wait, 0.00312 is 3.12e-3.

3.57142857 * 0.00312 = approx:

3.57142857 *3 =10.71428571e-3 → 0.01071428571

3.57142857 *0.12e-3 → 0.0004285714264

Total for 0.00312: 0.01071428571 + 0.0004285714264 ≈ 0.01114285714.

So summing up all parts:

17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20.000000 (since 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20 exactly).

Adding the 0.01114285714 gives 20.011142857 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than 20.011. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

v = 0.96c.

So (v/c) =0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784).

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the gamma value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the calculation to account for the fact that the nucleus is moving, but perhaps the energy is per nucleon? No, the problem says the energy of the nucleus.

Wait another thought: the problem says 'energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c'. So RHIC accelerates the nucleus to that speed, so the total energy is the relativistic energy of the nucleus.

So everything so far seems correct.

But according to my calculation, the answer is approximately 20.011 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the mass of Li-6. Maybe I used the wrong isotope. Wait, X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01516 u.

Wait, but perhaps the mass is in terms of the nucleon mass. So the mass of Li-6 is 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV/c².

But wait, no. Because the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but in this case, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as 6 * m_n, where m_n is the neutron mass, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the mass is given as the number of nucleons times the average mass of a nucleon.

Wait, but the standard approach is to use the rest mass of the nucleus. So perhaps I should use the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking up the exact value, the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01516 u.

So, 6.01516 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that more precisely.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01516 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.00516 *931.5= approx 4.814.

So 9.315 +4.814=14.129 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.129=5603.129 MeV, which is 5.603129 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.603129 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.603129.

Let me do this calculation precisely.

3.57142857 *5.603129.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603129 =16.809387

0.5*5.603129=2.8015645

0.07142857 *5.603129.

Wait, 0.07142857 is approximately 1/14, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 3.57142857 *5.603129 exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps we can compute this step by step.

3.57142857 *5.603129 = ?

I'll compute it as:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.003129 ≈ ?

Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.003129.

0.003 is 3.57142857 * 0.003 = 0.0107142857.

0.000129 is 3.57142857 *0.000129 ≈ 0.0004612747.

Adding them: 0.0107142857 +0.0004612747 ≈ 0.01117556.

So summing all parts:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.000000 (since 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20 exactly).

Adding the 0.01117556 gives 20.01117556 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm, that's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake?

Wait another thought: perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision. Let me recalculate gamma.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is different. Wait, Li-6 has a mass of 6.01516 u, so 6.01516 * 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6 * 931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01516 *931.5 = let me compute more accurately.

0.01516 ×931.5:

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.005*931.5=4.6575.

0.00016 *931.5=0.14904.

So sum is 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 + 0.14904=14.12154 MeV.

So total mass energy is 5589 +14.12154=5603.12154 MeV=5.60312154 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.60312154.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute this multiplication precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60312154.

Let me think of 3.57142857 as 25/7 (since 25/7≈3.57142857).

So 25/7 *5.60312154.

25/7 *5 = 125/7=17.857142857.

25/7 *0.60312154 = ?

0.60312154 *25 =15.0780385.

15.0780385 /7 = approx 2.1540055.

So summing 17.857142857 +2.1540055 =20.011148357 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.0111 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV. But that's higher. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus's mass is actually higher because it's a charged particle and maybe some other factor? Or perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, let me compute gamma using more precise calculation.

v=0.96c.

beta = v/c =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

That's precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Wait, no, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, not the kinetic.

Ah! Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total energy is gamma * m c². But sometimes, in problems, when people refer to the energy imparted by the collider, they might be referring to the kinetic energy. Wait, but in this case, RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain speed, so the energy is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon, assuming the nucleus is made of A nucleons each with mass m_n, but that's not correct because the nucleus's rest mass is less than A times the nucleon mass due to binding energy. So perhaps the problem expects me to approximate the mass as A times the proton mass.

Wait, but let me compute the mass of Li-6 as 6 * m_p, where m_p is 938 MeV/c².

6 * 938 = 5,628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628= ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857= 0.09999999 (approx 0.1).

So 2.14285714 +0.09999999≈2.24285713.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.24285713≈20.1 GeV.

Ah! That's about 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the rest mass is A * m_p.

Hmm, so using 6 * 938 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628 accurately.

5.628 =5 +0.628.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628 = let's compute it step by step.

0.6 *3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.02 *3.57142857=0.0714285714.

0.008 *3.57142857=0.02857142856.

Adding those: 2.142857142 + 0.0714285714 =2.2142857134 +0.02857142856≈2.242857142 GeV.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.242857142 =20.100 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is close.

But why the discrepancy? Because the actual mass of Li-6 is about 5.603 GeV, but when using 6 *938, it's 5.628 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation where the mass is A * m_p, which is 5.628 GeV.

Thus, E= 3.57142857 *5.628 = approx 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's precise.

So using m =5.628 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me compute this as 3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628 = ?

Again, 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.02 =0.0714285714.

3.57142857 *0.008 =0.02857142856.

Adding those gives 2.142857142 +0.0714285714 =2.2142857134 +0.02857142856 =2.24285714196.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.24285714196 =20.10000 (since 17.85714285 +2.24285714196=20.100000).

Wait, but 17.85714285 + 2.24285714196 is exactly 20.10000.

So why is option C 20.132 GeV? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 * m_p, which is 6 *938 =5628 MeV=5.628 GeV, as I did before.

So using that, E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.1 GeV.

But option C is 20.132, which is 0.032 GeV higher. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately using more precise values.

Let me compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

Wait, 5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5.628 *4/7 = (5.628 *4)/7 =22.512/7 ≈3.216.

So total would be 16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Wait, no, the question says 'energy of the RHIC' which is the total energy. But if I'm not mistaken, sometimes in particle physics, when you talk about the energy imparted by a collider, you're talking about the kinetic energy, not the total. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think. The total energy is gamma * m c². The kinetic energy is (gamma-1)*m c².

If the problem asks for the total energy, then my initial approach is correct. But perhaps the question is referring to kinetic energy, which would be 20.1 -5.628 =14.472 GeV. But none of the options are that low.

Wait, the options are all above 18 GeV, so that can't be. Thus, the initial approach must be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass is 6.01516 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.01516 *931.5 =5603.12 MeV =5.60312 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60312 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60312 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00312 *3.57142857=0.01114285714.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.01114285714=2.15400 GeV.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.154 =20.01114285 GeV.

Which is about 20.011 GeV.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the atomic mass of lithium-6, which includes electrons. Because the nucleus is Li-6, but the atomic mass includes electrons.

Wait a second! Oh, I think I made a mistake here. The mass I used was the atomic mass, which includes electrons. But the nucleus is Li-6, so I should subtract the mass of the electrons.

Wait, yes. Because when we talk about the nucleus, it's only protons and neutrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

So for Li-6, which has 3 electrons, because Li has atomic number 3.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.01516 u, but the nucleus is 6.01516 u minus 3 * m_e, where m_e is the electron mass, which is about 0.00054858 u.

So the nucleus mass is:

6.01516 u - 3 *0.00054858 u.

Compute 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01516 -0.00164574 =6.01351426 u.

Then, converting to GeV: 6.01351426 u * 931.5 MeV/u =6.01351426 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01351426 *931.5 MeV.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00351426 *931.5= approx 3.264 MeV.

So total is 9.315 +3.264=12.579 MeV.

So total nucleus mass energy is 5589 +12.579=5601.579 MeV =5.601579 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601579 GeV.

Compute this.

3.57142857 *5.601579.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.601579 =16.804737.

0.57142857 *5.601579.

0.5 *5.601579=2.8007895.

0.07142857 *5.601579 ≈0.07142857 *5=0.35714285, plus 0.07142857 *0.601579≈0.043.

So about 0.35714285 +0.043=0.40014285.

So 0.57142857 *5.601579 ≈2.8007895 +0.40014285≈3.20093235.

So total E=16.804737 +3.20093235≈20.005669 GeV.

Approximately 20.0057 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, but it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the nucleon as 938 MeV/c², so the nucleus mass would be 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV=20.100 GeV.

Which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of more precise values for gamma.

Wait, perhaps I made an approximation error in gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.571428571.

But perhaps the exact value is a bit more precise.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.571428571.

But perhaps the actual calculation uses more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) with more precision.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: exact value is 0.28, because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So no error there.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.601579 more accurately.

Let me compute 5.601579 *3.57142857.

I'll compute 5.601579 *3.57142857:

Break it into 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.601579 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.001579 *3.57142857≈0.005632.

So 0.601579 *3.57142857≈2.142857142 +0.005632=2.148489 GeV.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.148489≈20.00563185 GeV≈20.0056 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic energy formula with more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the exact formula, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, but I don't think so because the options are in GeV, and the nucleus has 6 nucleons.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton plus neutron, i.e., m_p + m_n, but that doesn't make much sense for the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is considered as consisting of 6 nucleons, each with mass m_n, but that's not correct because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Maybe the average mass per nucleon is used.

But I think I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that my calculation using the correct nucleus mass gives about 20.01 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass of the nucleus. Let me double-check the exact mass of Li-6.

Upon checking, the standard atomic weight of Li-6 is 6.01516 u. But when considering the nucleus, we subtract the electrons.

Li has 3 electrons. So the nucleus mass is 6.01516 u - 3 * m_e.

m_e is approximately 0.00054858 u.

So 3 *0.00054858=0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.01516 -0.00164574=6.01351426 u.

Converting to GeV:

6.01351426 u * 931.5 MeV/u =6.01351426 * 931.5 MeV.

Compute that.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01351426 *931.5= let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00351426 *931.5.

0.003 *931.5=2.7945 MeV.

0.00051426 *931.5≈0.479 MeV.

So 2.7945 +0.479=3.2735 MeV.

Adding to 9.315 →9.315 +3.2735=12.5885 MeV.

Total is 5589 +12.5885=5601.5885 MeV=5.6015885 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6015885 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6015885.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0015885 *3.57142857≈0.005675.

So 0.6015885*3.57142857≈2.142857142 + 0.005675≈2.148532.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.148532≈20.00567485 GeV.

Still around 20.0057 GeV.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is treated as a particle whose rest mass is the sum of the constituent nucleons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of a proton: ~938.272 MeV/c².

Mass of a neutron: ~939.565 MeV/c².

So total mass of Li-6 nucleus would be 3*(938.272 +939.565) MeV.

Wait, wait. No, because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*(938.272+939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511= ?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.033511= let's compute:

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈0.012535.

So sum: 0.107142857 +0.012535≈0.119677857.

So 3.57142857 *0.633511 ≈2.142857142 +0.119677857≈2.262535 GeV.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.262535≈20.11967785 GeV.

Approximately 20.12 GeV.

Which is very close to option C) 20.132 GeV.

Ah! So perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be calculated as the sum of the individual nucleons, not subtracting the electrons. So using 5.6335 GeV as the rest mass.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6335 ≈20.1197 GeV → approximately 20.12 GeV.

Which matches option C) 20.132 GeV very closely.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a Li-6 nucleus to a speed of \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy of the nucleus is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus
The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.01516 \, \text{u} \). Since the nucleus excludes electrons, we subtract the mass of 3 electrons (\( 3 \times 0.00054858 \, \text{u} \)):

\[
\text{Nucleus mass} = 6.01516 - 0.00164574 = 6.01351426 \, \text{u}
\]

Converting to GeV using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \):

\[
m = 6.01351426 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5601.5885 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6015885 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6015885 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6015885 \approx 2.148532 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.148532 \approx 20.00567485 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using nucleon masses
If the rest mass is approximated as the sum of individual nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), with \( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the total rest mass is:

\[
m = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Recomputing the total energy:

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.633511 \approx 2.262535 \, \text{GeV}
\]

\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.262535 \approx 20.11967785 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated energy aligns closely with option **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is consistent with the assumption of approximating the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleons. 

Answer: C
