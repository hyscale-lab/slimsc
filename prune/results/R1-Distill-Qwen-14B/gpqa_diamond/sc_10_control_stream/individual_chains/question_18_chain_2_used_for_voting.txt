Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand what's given. Both stars have masses more than our Sun, but wait, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here? The question is about elemental abundances, so perhaps the mass is just extra info. I'll keep that in mind but maybe it's not needed for the calculations.

So, the abundances are given in terms of their logarithmic ratios. [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. Oh right, the brackets denote the logarithm of the ratio compared to the Sun's value.

Given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So for Star 1, the ratio of silicon to iron is 10^0.3 times higher than the Sun's ratio.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Similarly, for Star 2, magnesium to silicon ratio is 10^0.3 higher than solar.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star 1 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Same for Mg to H in Star 2.

And the Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The notation is 12 + log(n_X/n_H) = value. So for Fe, it's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5-12= -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5. So nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, but wait. The notation [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that's the Sun's value. Same for [Mg/H]_2=0, so Star 2's Mg/H is solar.

But let's re-express all the abundances in terms of numbers.

Starting with the Sun:
nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) because log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5).

For Star 1:
[Fe/H]_1 =0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun =10^-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no, the definition: [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )=0.3.

We can calculate nSi_sun / nFe_sun. From the Sun's data, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^-4.5, nSi_sun is not given. Wait, but wait, we can compute nSi_sun relative to H? Hmm, no, because the Sun's data only gives Fe and Mg. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I need to find the ratios. Let me think of the ratios step by step.

Let me first find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen.

For Star 1:
We know nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, no. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

So to find nSi_1, we can write:
nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But wait, nSi_sun /nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, but from the Sun's data:
nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, what about nSi_sun? Hmm, the Sun's composition doesn't give nSi. Oh wait, but perhaps we can express Si in terms of Mg, or maybe we're missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that both stars are compared to the Sun, so I can find the ratios in terms of other elements.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by expressing each element's abundance relative to hydrogen.

Let me start with Star 1.

Star_1:
nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun /nFe_sun. Wait, but the Sun's data gives nFe and nMg, not Si. So maybe I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Si and Mg. Because Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si] for the Sun first, since that's given.

Wait, the Sun's data is nMg/nH =1e-5, nFe/nH=1e-4.5. But no, nSi isn't given. Hmm. I'm stuck because I don't know nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the photospheric composition for the Sun includes all the necessary elements. Wait, the problem states: "Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7." So nFe and nMg are given, but not Si. So perhaps I'm missing the Sun's silicon abundance. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun? No, wait, no, that's not how it's defined. The [X/Y] notation is log(nX/nY) relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun would be log(nMg/nSi)_sun - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.

But I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si] value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nMg =1e-5 * nH, and nFe=1e-4.5 *nH.

But without knowing nSi, I can't compute nMg/nSi. So perhaps I'm missing a piece of data. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Wait, let's think again. The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, I need to find (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

But wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's approach this more systematically.

For each star, we'll find the ratio nSi /nH, then take the ratio of those two.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5.

We also know [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But to find nSi_1, I can write:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for the Sun, I can find nSi_sun in terms of nH_sun.

Wait, I don't have that. Maybe I should think in terms of the other star's data.

Wait, let's look at Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So, nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3:

log( (nMg_2 / nH_2) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = log( (1e-5) / (nSi_2 /nH_2)) )=0.3 + log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express [Mg/Si]_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But we also know that nMg_2 =1e-5 *nH_2.

So:

(1e-5 *nH_2) /nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Hmm, but without knowing nSi_sun, I can't proceed. Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Let me rearrange:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun))) )

But nMg_2 is 1e-5 *nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )

Hmm, but I don't know nSi_sun. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe I should find [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) relative to itself, so that's zero. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, [Mg/Si]_sun is 0, meaning log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.

So that's not giving any new info.

Hmm, maybe I can express the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of the Sun's nSi.

Wait, let's try to express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_1 and nH_2 respectively.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = 1e-4.5 *nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, but nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) ) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / (1e-4.5 nH_sun )) )

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun) / (1e-4.5 *nH_sun ) )

The 1e-4.5 cancels out:

nSi_1 = nH_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Substitute nMg_2 =1e-5 *nH_2,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ]

But I don't know nSi_sun, so perhaps I can express the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So,

nSi_1 = nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

nSi_2 = [1e-5 *nH_2 ] / [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ]

So, the ratio is:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

= [nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] * [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) / (1e-5 *nH_2) ]

= [nH_1 * (10^{0.3})^2 * (nMg_sun) ) ] / [ (nH_sun) * (1e-5 *nH_2) ) ]

Because (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, let's double-check:

(nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

Yes.

So substituting,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 * 10^{0.6} * nMg_sun ] / [nH_sun * 1e-5 *nH_2) ]

But wait, nMg_sun is 1e-5 *nH_sun.

Because from the Sun's data, nMg/nH =1e-5 → nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So substituting nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 *10^{0.6} * (1e-5 *nH_sun) ] / [nH_sun * 1e-5 *nH_2 ) ]

Let's see:

nH_1 and nH_2: are the hydrogen densities in each star. But unless the stars have the same nH, which we don't know, perhaps we can relate them?

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms, which would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ).

Wait a minute, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the ratio we're looking for is (nSi_1 /nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 /nH_2), which is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Wait, so let me compute this ratio:

Ratio = (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = [nSi_1 * nH_2 ] / [nH_1 *nSi_2 ]

Hmm, earlier I was trying to compute nSi_1 /nSi_2, but perhaps I should compute [nSi_1 /nH_1] / [nSi_2 /nH_2] instead.

So, [nSi_1 /nH_1] is the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star_1.

Similarly for Star_2.

So, let's compute each term.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

nFe_1 = [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH_1 =1e-4.5 *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

But nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun ) / (1e-4.5 *nH_sun )

The 1e-4.5 cancels out.

nSi_1 = (nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 ) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

nMg_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2 =1e-5 *nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Again, nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * ( (1e-5 *nH_sun ) /nSi_sun ) ) )

Simplify denominator:

= [1e-5 *nH_2 ] * [nSi_sun / (10^{0.3} *1e-5 *nH_sun ) ) ]

= [nH_2 *nSi_sun ] / [10^{0.3} *nH_sun ]

So,

nSi_2/nH_2 = [nSi_sun ] / [10^{0.3} *nH_sun ]

Now, the ratio we need is:

Ratio = (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^{0.3} (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (nSi_sun )/(10^{0.3} nH_sun ) ) ]

Simplify:

= [10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] * [10^{0.3} nH_sun / nSi_sun ) ]

The nSi_sun and nH_sun terms cancel out.

= (10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ) = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 10^0.6 accurately.

10^0.6 = e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.6 *2.302585) ≈ e^(1.38155) ≈3.98. So around 3.98, which is close to 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which matches. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

So the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Step 1: Silicon Abundance in Star_1
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{-4.5} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]

### Step 2: Silicon Abundance in Star_2
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{\frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \) and \( n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Since \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand what's given. Both stars have masses more than our Sun, but wait, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here? The question is about elemental abundances, so perhaps the mass is just extra info. I'll keep that in mind but maybe it's not needed for the calculations.

So, the abundances are given in terms of their logarithmic ratios. [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) relative to the Sun. Oh right, the brackets denote the logarithm of the ratio compared to the Sun's value.

Given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So for Star 1, the ratio of silicon to iron is 10^0.3 times higher than the Sun's ratio.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Similarly, for Star 2, magnesium to silicon ratio is 10^0.3 higher than solar.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star 1 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Same for Mg to H in Star 2.

And the Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The notation is 12 + log(n_X/n_H) = value. So for Fe, it's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5-12= -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5. So nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, but wait. The notation [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that's the Sun's value. Same for [Mg/H]_2=0, so Star 2's Mg/H is solar.

But let's re-express all the abundances in terms of numbers.

Starting with the Sun:
nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) because log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5).

For Star 1:
[Fe/H]_1 =0, so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun =10^-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no, the definition: [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) )=0.3.

We can calculate nSi_sun / nFe_sun. From the Sun's data, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^-4.5, nSi_sun is not given. Wait, but wait, we can compute nSi_sun relative to H? Hmm, no, because the Sun's data only gives Fe and Mg. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I need to find the ratios. Let me think of the ratios step by step.

Let me first find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen.

For Star 1:
We know nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, no. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

So to find nSi_1, we can write:
nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But wait, nSi_sun /nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, but from the Sun's data:
nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, what about nSi_sun? Hmm, the Sun's composition doesn't give nSi. Oh wait, but perhaps we can express Si in terms of Mg, or maybe we're missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that both stars are compared to the Sun, so I can find the ratios in terms of other elements.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by expressing each element's abundance relative to hydrogen.

Let me start with Star 1.

Star_1:
nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun = 1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun /nFe_sun. Wait, but the Sun's data gives nFe and nMg, not Si. So maybe I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Si and Mg. Because Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Wait, maybe I can find [Mg/Si] for the Sun first, since that's given.

Wait, the Sun's data is nMg/nH =1e-5, nFe/nH=1e-4.5. But no, nSi isn't given. Hmm. I'm stuck because I don't know nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the photospheric composition for the Sun includes all the necessary elements. Wait, the problem states: "Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7." So nFe and nMg are given, but not Si. So perhaps I'm missing the Sun's silicon abundance. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun? No, wait, no, that's not how it's defined. The [X/Y] notation is log(nX/nY) relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun would be log(nMg/nSi)_sun - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.

But I don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si] value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nMg =1e-5 * nH, and nFe=1e-4.5 *nH.

But without knowing nSi, I can't compute nMg/nSi. So perhaps I'm missing a piece of data. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Wait, let's think again. The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, I need to find (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

But wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's approach this more systematically.

For each star, we'll find the ratio nSi /nH, then take the ratio of those two.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5.

We also know [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But to find nSi_1, I can write:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for the Sun, I can find nSi_sun in terms of nH_sun.

Wait, I don't have that. Maybe I should think in terms of the other star's data.

Wait, let's look at Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So, nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3:

log( (nMg_2 / nH_2) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = log( (1e-5) / (nSi_2 /nH_2)) )=0.3 + log( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express [Mg/Si]_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg_2/nSi_2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So, nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But we also know that nMg_2 =1e-5 *nH_2.

So:

(1e-5 *nH_2) /nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

Hmm, but without knowing nSi_sun, I can't proceed. Wait, perhaps I can express nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Let me rearrange:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun))) )

But nMg_2 is 1e-5 *nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )

Hmm, but I don't know nSi_sun. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe I should find [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) relative to itself, so that's zero. But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, [Mg/Si]_sun is 0, meaning log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.

So that's not giving any new info.

Hmm, maybe I can express the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of the Sun's nSi.

Wait, let's try to express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_1 and nH_2 respectively.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = 1e-4.5 *nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, but nFe_sun = 1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) ) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / (1e-4.5 nH_sun )) )

Simplify:

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun) / (1e-4.5 *nH_sun ) )

The 1e-4.5 cancels out:

nSi_1 = nH_1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 =1e-5 * nH_2.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) +0.3.

So,

nMg_2/nSi_2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Substitute nMg_2 =1e-5 *nH_2,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ]

But I don't know nSi_sun, so perhaps I can express the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So,

nSi_1 = nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

nSi_2 = [1e-5 *nH_2 ] / [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ]

So, the ratio is:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

= [nH_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] * [10^{0.3} (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) / (1e-5 *nH_2) ]

= [nH_1 * (10^{0.3})^2 * (nMg_sun) ) ] / [ (nH_sun) * (1e-5 *nH_2) ) ]

Because (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

Wait, let's double-check:

(nSi_sun /nH_sun) * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

Yes.

So substituting,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 * 10^{0.6} * nMg_sun ] / [nH_sun * 1e-5 *nH_2) ]

But wait, nMg_sun is 1e-5 *nH_sun.

Because from the Sun's data, nMg/nH =1e-5 → nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So substituting nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun,

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [nH_1 *10^{0.6} * (1e-5 *nH_sun) ] / [nH_sun * 1e-5 *nH_2 ) ]

Let's see:

nH_1 and nH_2: are the hydrogen densities in each star. But unless the stars have the same nH, which we don't know, perhaps we can relate them?

Wait, but the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms, which would be (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ).

Wait a minute, I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the ratio we're looking for is (nSi_1 /nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 /nH_2), which is (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2).

Wait, so let me compute this ratio:

Ratio = (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = [nSi_1 * nH_2 ] / [nH_1 *nSi_2 ]

Hmm, earlier I was trying to compute nSi_1 /nSi_2, but perhaps I should compute [nSi_1 /nH_1] / [nSi_2 /nH_2] instead.

So, [nSi_1 /nH_1] is the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star_1.

Similarly for Star_2.

So, let's compute each term.

For Star_1:

nSi_1 = nFe_1 *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

nFe_1 = [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH_1 =1e-4.5 *nH_1.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

But nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_1 = (1e-4.5 *nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun ) / (1e-4.5 *nH_sun )

The 1e-4.5 cancels out.

nSi_1 = (nH_1) *10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So,

nSi_1/nH_1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2 ) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

nMg_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2 =1e-5 *nH_2.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Again, nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2) / (10^{0.3} * ( (1e-5 *nH_sun ) /nSi_sun ) ) )

Simplify denominator:

= [1e-5 *nH_2 ] * [nSi_sun / (10^{0.3} *1e-5 *nH_sun ) ) ]

= [nH_2 *nSi_sun ] / [10^{0.3} *nH_sun ]

So,

nSi_2/nH_2 = [nSi_sun ] / [10^{0.3} *nH_sun ]

Now, the ratio we need is:

Ratio = (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [10^{0.3} (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (nSi_sun )/(10^{0.3} nH_sun ) ) ]

Simplify:

= [10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] * [10^{0.3} nH_sun / nSi_sun ) ]

The nSi_sun and nH_sun terms cancel out.

= (10^{0.3} *10^{0.3} ) = 10^{0.6}.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 10^0.6 accurately.

10^0.6 = e^(0.6 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.6 *2.302585) ≈ e^(1.38155) ≈3.98. So around 3.98, which is close to 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which matches. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9.

So the answer should be A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3 \).

3. **Sun's Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log(n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}} / n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Step 1: Silicon Abundance in Star_1
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log(n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{-4.5} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}).
\]

### Step 2: Silicon Abundance in Star_2
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:
\[
\log(n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log(n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}) + 0.3.
\]
Using \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \), we find:
\[
n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{\frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}})}{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 10^{-5} \) and \( n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Since \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
