Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relation involving parallax. 

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/parallax^5. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5? I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, we're looking at how N changes as a function of distance r (assuming r is similar to d here). If N is proportional to r^5, then the number increases rapidly with distance.

But wait, another thought: maybe I should think in terms of differential. Like, how does the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r change with r. Because when we talk about number per unit range, it's like a differential change.

So, let me think. N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr would be the number at r+dr minus the number at r, which is roughly dN = ( (r+dr)^5 - r^5 ) * some constant.

Expanding (r+dr)^5 using binomial approximation, since dr is small compared to r, it's r^5 + 5 r^4 dr. Subtracting r^5 gives 5 r^4 dr. So dN/d(r) is proportional to 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's the rate of change, the derivative, which is proportional to r^4. So the number increases as r^4.

But wait, the options don't have r^4 as the answer. Let me check the options again. Option C is r^4, right. So if the rate of change (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4, then the number of stars in a given distance range increases with r^4.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The initial statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d, so 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But when considering the number of stars in a thin shell (i.e., between distances r and r+dr), that would be N(r+dr) - N(r) ≈ 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance dr is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars in each subsequent shell increases by r^4. So the rate of change is r^4.

But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Wait, perhaps it's simply the number of stars within a certain region as a function of r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number of stars increases by a factor of r^5. But wait, that's not the rate. The rate is the derivative, which is 5 r^4.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more carefully.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

Now, the problem is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if you consider a small change in distance dr, how much does the number of stars change?

So, the number of stars between distance r and r+dr is the difference in N. So dN = (r+dr)^5 - r^5 = 5 r^4 dr + ... higher order terms, which are negligible for small dr. So dN ≈ 5 r^4 dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

So the number of stars in a region of the sky (per unit distance) increases as r^4. So the correct option would be C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me double-check the options:

A) r^3

B) r^5

C) r^4

D) r^2

Yes, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. This means the number of stars grows rapidly with distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). Using the relation \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative \( dN/dr \) is proportional to \( 5d^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
