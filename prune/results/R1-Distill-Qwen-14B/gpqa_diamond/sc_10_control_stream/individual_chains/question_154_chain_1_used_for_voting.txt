Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me look at the given information. The compound is a white solid. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak is 32%, which is about a third. Could that be a doublet or maybe a fragment? Or perhaps it's something like a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a common isotope with a mass of about 35 and 37. So if the molecular formula includes Cl, the molecular ion might split into peaks. Let me think: the molecular weight is 156, so if the molecular formula includes Cl, let's see: 156 minus Cl (35.5) would be around 120.5, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually suggests either an -OH group (from a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or an -NH stretch, but no amine groups are in the options. Wait, the problem says it's a white solid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would be broad. But the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, could it be an ester or a ketone? But the 3500-2700 peak suggests an -OH, which might point towards a carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's see: 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very deshielded proton. A singlet suggests no neighboring protons. What gives a singlet at 11? Probably an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in this case, it's 11, which is higher. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, this is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton but not a carboxylic acid? Alternatively, could it be an aromatic aldehyde? But then the IR wouldn't have the broad peak. Or perhaps it's something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, since the two doublets have the same integration and are likely in a para arrangement. So maybe the compound is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

So putting it together: let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with a Cl and OH groups. Wait, if it's 2-hydroxy, that's the meta position for Cl. Wait, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and aldehyde at position 1? Or wait, I might be getting that wrong. Benzaldehyde is like PhCHO, so substituents would be on the benzene ring. So 2-hydroxy would be ortho to the aldehyde. Then 3-chloro would be meta to aldehyde. Wait, but that would put Cl and OH both on the benzene ring adjacent to the aldehyde group. Let me think about the NMR for that. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9.8-10 ppm, but in this case, the NMR shows 11.0 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. Also, the IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which is more like a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700-1725). Benzaldehyde's carbonyl would be around 1700, but the aldehyde proton is at ~9-10. So if the proton is at 11, maybe not an aldehyde. So option A might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. So the benzene ring would have substituents in the para positions. The IR would show a broad peak for the -OH (carboxylic acid) and a strong carbonyl at ~1720. The NMR for benzoic acid: the OH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the given NMR, it's a singlet, but the integration is 1H. Wait, but in the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH group is also attached. So the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern.

Looking at the NMR: for benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons would be deshielded. In para-substituted benzoic acid, the protons would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's what is observed here: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That seems to fit. Also, the 11.0 ppm singlet is the -COOH proton. Wait, but in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Hmm, that could be because it's exchanging rapidly and appears as a singlet. Or perhaps it's not the COOH. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. But let's keep that in mind.

Now, the molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is ~35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 84 +5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh wait, approximately 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would correspond to the M+ peak. But 156 is exactly 156. So perhaps the exact mass is 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156, which is 156. So maybe it's the M peak plus a fragment? Or perhaps the molecular formula is different.

Wait, the other peak is at m/z 158 (32%). So that's 2 mass units higher. Could that be from chlorine? Chlorine has isotopes at 35 and 37, so in a molecule with one Cl, you get peaks at M and M+2. The intensity would be roughly 3:1 (since natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%). So the M peak would be at 156 (Cl-35), and the M+2 peak at 158 (Cl-37). So the abundance would be about 75% and 25%, but wait in the data, the M is 100% (maybe it's a base peak), and the M+2 is 32%, which is closer to 33% (since 25% of 100 is 25, but maybe the instrument's sensitivity is different). So that fits with the presence of one Cl atom in the molecule.

So option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, would have a molecular weight of 156.5. The molecular ion would be at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37), so the 158 peak is 32%, which aligns with about a third, which is roughly 25% (since 75% of 100 is 75, but wait, the Cl-35 is two isotopes. Wait, perhaps I should think about the probabilities. If the molecule has one Cl, then the M is Cl-35 (75% abundance) and M+2 is Cl-37 (25% abundance). So the ratio would be M:M+2 = 3:1. So in the mass spec, M would be 3 times higher than M+2. But in the data, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%—so 100 is about 3 times 32 (since 32 *3=96, close to 100). So that fits, because 3:1 is the expected ratio. So the presence of one Cl is confirmed.

But wait, let's check other options. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in ortho position with COOH. The NMR would have the same pattern because it's also a para-substituted? No, wait, 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in the ortho position to COOH. So the aromatic protons would be in a different arrangement. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two H's in the ortho positions are equivalent, so you get two doublets. But in 2-chloro, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 4, perhaps leading to different splitting. Wait, no. Let me think about the ring. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. The protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and COOH?), and positions 4 and 6 would also be equivalent. But I'm not sure about the exact NMR shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR would show more splitting, but the given data has two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted pattern. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would give the two doublets as observed, while 2-chlorobenzoic acid might give a different splitting.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-Ph. So, it's an ester. But wait, chloroformate is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. Let me think about the IR. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. But what about the IR's broad peak? Esters don't usually have broad OH stretches. Wait, unless there's another functional group. But in chloroformate ester, the oxygen is connected to Cl and OPh. So the IR broad peak from 3500-2700 might suggest an alcohol or maybe an amine, but in this case, it's phenyl chloroformate, which is O=C(OCl)Ph. Wait, actually, chloroformate esters can hydrolyze, but if it's pure, it shouldn't have -OH. So maybe the IR's broad peak isn't from an -OH, which could conflict. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an O-H stretch in the chloroformate? No, chloroformate esters don't have O-H groups. So that might not fit.

But let's think about the molecular weight. Phenyl chloroformate would be ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So molecular weight would be same, around 156.5. So the mass spec would look the same as option B, with peaks at 156 and 158. So the mass spec doesn't distinguish between B and C.

But looking at NMR: for phenyl chloroformate, the protons would be on the aromatic ring. If the substituents are in the para position, similar to benzoic acid, the NMR would show similar patterns. Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. So the ester group is attached to the benzene. So the O-CO-Cl is attached to the benzene. So the substituent is an ester group. So the aromatic protons would be in a para position relative to the ester group, leading to the same NMR splitting as benzoic acid. Because the substituent is in the same position (para), the NMR would show two doublets. So the aromatic protons would be similar.

But what about the other NMR signals? The 11.0 ppm singlet is 1H. For phenyl chloroformate, what protons would show up? The structure is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. So no protons attached to O. The only other protons are the aromatic ones. So the 11.0 ppm peak would have to come from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a proton from the compound itself, but maybe it's a peak from the deuterated solvent or something else. That doesn't make sense. So maybe phenyl chloroformate doesn't have a proton at 11 ppm. So this suggests option C is not the correct one.

Wait, another thought: phenyl chloroformate might have a Cl attached to the carbonyl, but no -OH group. So the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 wouldn't come from an -OH, which contradicts the data. So that makes option C less likely.

So back to the options, options B and D have -COOH groups. Let's check D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and COOH), and positions 4 and 6 would also be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets, perhaps? Alternatively, maybe a triplet or something else. Wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So the ring would have symmetry such that the protons are in two sets of two. Let me think about the coupling. For example, in para-substituted rings, the coupling constants are larger, but for ortho substituents, the coupling could be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have the aromatic protons as a doublet of doublets or something more complex. But the given NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted ring, which would be more consistent with option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) than D.

So, going back. Option B's structure would have the COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the other positions (2,3,5,6) have protons. The ring would be symmetric, so protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and another for the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5). 

In terms of chemical shifts, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6 in benzoic acid) are usually more deshielded. So in the NMR, the higher shift (8.02 ppm) would correspond to the protons next to COOH, and the lower shift (7.72 ppm) would be next to Cl. That makes sense because electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the adjacent protons, but COOH is a stronger electron-withdrawing group.

So putting it all together: the IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm^-1) which fits a carboxylic acid. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is likely the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm, which would be the exchangeable proton of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, fitting a para-substituted benzoic acid. The mass spec shows peaks at 156 and 158, consistent with one Cl atom in the molecule.

So option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, seems to fit all the data.

To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the spectral data provided:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) is observed.  
- The presence of a chlorine isotope (Cl-35: 75%, Cl-37: 25%) explains the two peaks, with the ratio of 100% to 32% matching the expected 3:1 ratio for Cl isotopes.  
- This suggests the molecular formula includes one chlorine atom and a molecular weight of **156 g/mol**.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.  

### Proton NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet at this chemical shift is characteristic of the acidic -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.  
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.  

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would produce a proton signal around 9-10 ppm, not 11.0 ppm.  
   - The IR would not show a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, as aldehydes typically absorb slightly lower (~1700 cm⁻¹).  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - The structure features a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position on the benzene ring.  
   - The IR spectrum matches: a broad -OH stretch and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The NMR spectrum matches: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the -OH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted pattern.  
   - The molecular weight (156 g/mol) and mass spec data (m/z = 156 and 158) are consistent.  
   - **Fits all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound is an ester (O=C(Cl)O-Ph) and lacks an -OH group.  
   - The IR would not show a broad -OH stretch, as esters do not have exchangeable protons.  
   - The NMR would not show a singlet at 11.0 ppm, as phenyl chloroformate does not have an -OH proton.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - The NMR pattern would differ: the aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets due to the asymmetry introduced by the ortho substitution.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry) are consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me look at the given information. The compound is a white solid. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The 158 peak is 32%, which is about a third. Could that be a doublet or maybe a fragment? Or perhaps it's something like a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a common isotope with a mass of about 35 and 37. So if the molecular formula includes Cl, the molecular ion might split into peaks. Let me think: the molecular weight is 156, so if the molecular formula includes Cl, let's see: 156 minus Cl (35.5) would be around 120.5, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually suggests either an -OH group (from a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or an -NH stretch, but no amine groups are in the options. Wait, the problem says it's a white solid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the OH would be broad. But the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, could it be an ester or a ketone? But the 3500-2700 peak suggests an -OH, which might point towards a carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's see: 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very deshielded proton. A singlet suggests no neighboring protons. What gives a singlet at 11? Probably an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in this case, it's 11, which is higher. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, but in the NMR, this is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an acidic proton but not a carboxylic acid? Alternatively, could it be an aromatic aldehyde? But then the IR wouldn't have the broad peak. Or perhaps it's something else.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, since the two doublets have the same integration and are likely in a para arrangement. So maybe the compound is a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

So putting it together: let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with a Cl and OH groups. Wait, if it's 2-hydroxy, that's the meta position for Cl. Wait, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and aldehyde at position 1? Or wait, I might be getting that wrong. Benzaldehyde is like PhCHO, so substituents would be on the benzene ring. So 2-hydroxy would be ortho to the aldehyde. Then 3-chloro would be meta to aldehyde. Wait, but that would put Cl and OH both on the benzene ring adjacent to the aldehyde group. Let me think about the NMR for that. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9.8-10 ppm, but in this case, the NMR shows 11.0 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. Also, the IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which is more like a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700-1725). Benzaldehyde's carbonyl would be around 1700, but the aldehyde proton is at ~9-10. So if the proton is at 11, maybe not an aldehyde. So option A might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1. So the benzene ring would have substituents in the para positions. The IR would show a broad peak for the -OH (carboxylic acid) and a strong carbonyl at ~1720. The NMR for benzoic acid: the OH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the given NMR, it's a singlet, but the integration is 1H. Wait, but in the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So the structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring, and the COOH group is also attached. So the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern.

Looking at the NMR: for benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons would be deshielded. In para-substituted benzoic acid, the protons would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's what is observed here: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That seems to fit. Also, the 11.0 ppm singlet is the -COOH proton. Wait, but in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Hmm, that could be because it's exchanging rapidly and appears as a singlet. Or perhaps it's not the COOH. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. But let's keep that in mind.

Now, the molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is ~35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 84 +5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh wait, approximately 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would correspond to the M+ peak. But 156 is exactly 156. So perhaps the exact mass is 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156, which is 156. So maybe it's the M peak plus a fragment? Or perhaps the molecular formula is different.

Wait, the other peak is at m/z 158 (32%). So that's 2 mass units higher. Could that be from chlorine? Chlorine has isotopes at 35 and 37, so in a molecule with one Cl, you get peaks at M and M+2. The intensity would be roughly 3:1 (since natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%). So the M peak would be at 156 (Cl-35), and the M+2 peak at 158 (Cl-37). So the abundance would be about 75% and 25%, but wait in the data, the M is 100% (maybe it's a base peak), and the M+2 is 32%, which is closer to 33% (since 25% of 100 is 25, but maybe the instrument's sensitivity is different). So that fits with the presence of one Cl atom in the molecule.

So option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, would have a molecular weight of 156.5. The molecular ion would be at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37), so the 158 peak is 32%, which aligns with about a third, which is roughly 25% (since 75% of 100 is 75, but wait, the Cl-35 is two isotopes. Wait, perhaps I should think about the probabilities. If the molecule has one Cl, then the M is Cl-35 (75% abundance) and M+2 is Cl-37 (25% abundance). So the ratio would be M:M+2 = 3:1. So in the mass spec, M would be 3 times higher than M+2. But in the data, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%—so 100 is about 3 times 32 (since 32 *3=96, close to 100). So that fits, because 3:1 is the expected ratio. So the presence of one Cl is confirmed.

But wait, let's check other options. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in ortho position with COOH. The NMR would have the same pattern because it's also a para-substituted? No, wait, 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in the ortho position to COOH. So the aromatic protons would be in a different arrangement. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two H's in the ortho positions are equivalent, so you get two doublets. But in 2-chloro, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 4, perhaps leading to different splitting. Wait, no. Let me think about the ring. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. The protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and COOH?), and positions 4 and 6 would also be equivalent. But I'm not sure about the exact NMR shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR would show more splitting, but the given data has two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted pattern. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would give the two doublets as observed, while 2-chlorobenzoic acid might give a different splitting.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is ClCO-O-Ph. So, it's an ester. But wait, chloroformate is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. Let me think about the IR. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. But what about the IR's broad peak? Esters don't usually have broad OH stretches. Wait, unless there's another functional group. But in chloroformate ester, the oxygen is connected to Cl and OPh. So the IR broad peak from 3500-2700 might suggest an alcohol or maybe an amine, but in this case, it's phenyl chloroformate, which is O=C(OCl)Ph. Wait, actually, chloroformate esters can hydrolyze, but if it's pure, it shouldn't have -OH. So maybe the IR's broad peak isn't from an -OH, which could conflict. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an O-H stretch in the chloroformate? No, chloroformate esters don't have O-H groups. So that might not fit.

But let's think about the molecular weight. Phenyl chloroformate would be ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So molecular weight would be same, around 156.5. So the mass spec would look the same as option B, with peaks at 156 and 158. So the mass spec doesn't distinguish between B and C.

But looking at NMR: for phenyl chloroformate, the protons would be on the aromatic ring. If the substituents are in the para position, similar to benzoic acid, the NMR would show similar patterns. Wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. So the ester group is attached to the benzene. So the O-CO-Cl is attached to the benzene. So the substituent is an ester group. So the aromatic protons would be in a para position relative to the ester group, leading to the same NMR splitting as benzoic acid. Because the substituent is in the same position (para), the NMR would show two doublets. So the aromatic protons would be similar.

But what about the other NMR signals? The 11.0 ppm singlet is 1H. For phenyl chloroformate, what protons would show up? The structure is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. So no protons attached to O. The only other protons are the aromatic ones. So the 11.0 ppm peak would have to come from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a proton from the compound itself, but maybe it's a peak from the deuterated solvent or something else. That doesn't make sense. So maybe phenyl chloroformate doesn't have a proton at 11 ppm. So this suggests option C is not the correct one.

Wait, another thought: phenyl chloroformate might have a Cl attached to the carbonyl, but no -OH group. So the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 wouldn't come from an -OH, which contradicts the data. So that makes option C less likely.

So back to the options, options B and D have -COOH groups. Let's check D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and COOH), and positions 4 and 6 would also be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets, perhaps? Alternatively, maybe a triplet or something else. Wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So the ring would have symmetry such that the protons are in two sets of two. Let me think about the coupling. For example, in para-substituted rings, the coupling constants are larger, but for ortho substituents, the coupling could be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2-chlorobenzoic acid would have the aromatic protons as a doublet of doublets or something more complex. But the given NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted ring, which would be more consistent with option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) than D.

So, going back. Option B's structure would have the COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 4, making the other positions (2,3,5,6) have protons. The ring would be symmetric, so protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the NMR would show two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and another for the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5). 

In terms of chemical shifts, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6 in benzoic acid) are usually more deshielded. So in the NMR, the higher shift (8.02 ppm) would correspond to the protons next to COOH, and the lower shift (7.72 ppm) would be next to Cl. That makes sense because electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the adjacent protons, but COOH is a stronger electron-withdrawing group.

So putting it all together: the IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm^-1) which fits a carboxylic acid. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is likely the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm, which would be the exchangeable proton of the carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, fitting a para-substituted benzoic acid. The mass spec shows peaks at 156 and 158, consistent with one Cl atom in the molecule.

So option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, seems to fit all the data.


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the spectral data provided:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156** (100%), and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) is observed.  
- The presence of a chlorine isotope (Cl-35: 75%, Cl-37: 25%) explains the two peaks, with the ratio of 100% to 32% matching the expected 3:1 ratio for Cl isotopes.  
- This suggests the molecular formula includes one chlorine atom and a molecular weight of **156 g/mol**.

### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.  
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.  

### Proton NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A singlet at this chemical shift is characteristic of the acidic -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.  
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.  

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would produce a proton signal around 9-10 ppm, not 11.0 ppm.  
   - The IR would not show a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, as aldehydes typically absorb slightly lower (~1700 cm⁻¹).  
   - **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - The structure features a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and a chlorine atom in the para position on the benzene ring.  
   - The IR spectrum matches: a broad -OH stretch and a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.  
   - The NMR spectrum matches: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the -OH proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted pattern.  
   - The molecular weight (156 g/mol) and mass spec data (m/z = 156 and 158) are consistent.  
   - **Fits all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound is an ester (O=C(Cl)O-Ph) and lacks an -OH group.  
   - The IR would not show a broad -OH stretch, as esters do not have exchangeable protons.  
   - The NMR would not show a singlet at 11.0 ppm, as phenyl chloroformate does not have an -OH proton.  
   - **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position.  
   - The NMR pattern would differ: the aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets due to the asymmetry introduced by the ortho substitution.  
   - **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data (IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry) are consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.
