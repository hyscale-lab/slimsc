Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem states: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Here, the Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for the Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for the mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait a second, neutrinos are tricky. I remember they have very small rest masses, but in many problems, especially in particle physics, we often treat them as massless because their rest mass is negligible compared to other particles. I should confirm that. Since the muon's rest mass is given, but there's no mention for the neutrino, I think I can assume it's massless. That might simplify things.

So the decay is a pion at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of these two particles. Hmm, okay.

I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum play a big role. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Wait, but if the neutrino is massless, then its momentum is just E/c, since for massless particles, E = pc. But wait, in units where c=1, like MeV and MeV/c, it's E = p. So the muon's momentum would be equal and opposite to the neutrino's. But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero.

So, momentum of muon (p_mu) plus momentum of neutrino (p_nu) must equal zero. Since p is a vector, and they're opposite, their magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = -p_nu. Therefore, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But wait, since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum. So E_nu = p_nu. And the muon's energy would be sqrt(p_mu^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4), but since I'm dealing in MeV and c=1, it's sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2). But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

Energy conservation: The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. So:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

Which is:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p

Because E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu is p (since p_nu = p).

So I can set up the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me write that more clearly. Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 MeV, and E_pion as 139.6 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = E_pion.

Let me call this equation (1).

I need to solve for p.

Hmm, solving for p in this equation might be a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. I can rearrange equation (1) to isolate the square root:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = E_pion - p.

Then square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (E_pion - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

(E_pion - p)^2 = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p + p².

So:

p² + m_mu² = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p + p².

I can subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p.

Then, rearrange to solve for p:

2 E_pion p = E_pion² - m_mu².

So,

p = (E_pion² - m_mu²) / (2 E_pion).

Plugging in the numbers:

E_pion = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Calculate numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, 139.6 squared. Let me compute 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 ≈ 19488.16.

Wait, actually, 139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute:

(140 - 0.4)(140 -0.4) = 140² - 2*(140)*(0.4) + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2. Let me compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2= 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me approximate: 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But wait, 29*279.2= 29*(200 + 79.2) = 5800 + 2296.8 = 8096.8.

So 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So 29.783 approximately. So about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, that's p, the momentum of the muon. Because the neutrino's momentum is the same magnitude, p_nu = p.

Now, next step is to find the energies of both particles.

The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute (29.78)^2: approximately 887.

(105.7)^2= 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.49) ≈ let's see, sqrt(12100)=110, so sqrt(12059) is about 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 = 12056.04.

Wait, but 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is slightly less than 12059.49. So the actual E_mu is a little more than 109.8.

Hmm, let's compute 109.81^2: 109.81 * 109.81.

109 * 109 = 11881. 109 * 0.81 = 88.29, 0.81 * 109 = another 88.29, and 0.81^2=0.6561. So perhaps it's easier to just compute (109.8 + 0.01)^2 = 109.8^2 + 2 *109.8 *0.01 + (0.01)^2.

109.8^2 = 12056.04.

So 12056.04 + 2*109.8*0.01 = 12056.04 + 2.196 = 12058.236.

Plus 0.0001 → 12058.2361. Hmm, still not quite 12059.49.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that E_mu is approximately 109.8 MeV plus some.

But perhaps another approach is better. Since p = (E_pion^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 E_pion), and I've calculated p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate E_mu as:

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_mu * sqrt(1 + (p/m_mu)^2).

But m_mu is 105.7 MeV, which is much larger than p (29.78), so (p/m_mu) is about 0.2816.

So (p/m_mu)² is about 0.0793.

So sqrt(1 + 0.0793) = sqrt(1.0793) ≈ 1.0388.

So E_mu ≈ m_mu * 1.0388 = 105.7 * 1.0388 ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, as before.

But let me proceed. The muon's kinetic energy is E_mu minus its rest mass, which is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 ≈4.1 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.1 MeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, which would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, so its energy is entirely kinetic, right? Because for a massless particle, E = pc, and the rest mass energy is zero. So the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait: the neutrino's energy is the same as its momentum p (since E=pc for massless particles when c=1). So E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check. For a massless particle, all its energy is kinetic because E = pc and m = 0, so E = K.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

That matches closely with what I've calculated. So the KE of the muon is ~4.12 MeV (option D's first value), and the neutrino's KE is ~29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute p again.

p = (E_pion^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 E_pion).

E_pion is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

E_pion^2 = (139.6)^2 = 139.6 * 139.6.

Let me calculate this again more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6 → Let me compute 140 * 140 = 19600.

But 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 = 105.7 *105.7.

Compute 100 * 100 = 10000, 100 *5.7=570, 5.7 *100 =570, 5.7 *5.7=32.49.

So (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2=100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49 =11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376; 8376 - 279.2 =8096.8.

279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(20 +9 +0.7) = 5584 + 2512.8 + 195.44 = 5584 +2512.8=8096.8 → +195.44 → 8292.24.

Wait, 279.2 *29.7 = 8292.24.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 more than 8292.24.

So 8315.67 - 8292.24 =23.43.

So 23.43 / 279.2 → approximately 0.0839.

So p is 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's KE is p =29.7839 MeV.

The muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculating 29.7839^2: 29.7839 *29.7839.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.7839 is approx 30 -0.2161.

So (30 -0.2161)^2 =900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2.

=900 -12.966 +0.0467= approx 887.08.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.08 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.57).

Compute sqrt(12059.57): Since 110^2 =12100, which is higher than 12059.57, so it's about 109.8.

Wait, 109.8^2= (110 -0.2)^2=110^2 -2*110*0.2 +0.2^2=12100-44 +0.04=12056.04.

So 12056.04 is 109.8^2.

Our value is 12059.57, which is 12056.04 +3.53.

So how much more is the sqrt? Let's compute the difference.

The value is 12059.57 → 12056.04 is 109.8^2, so difference is 3.53.

We can approximate the square root as 109.8 + delta, where delta is small.

(109.8 + delta)^2 ≈109.8^2 + 2*109.8*delta =12056.04 +219.6 delta.

Set this equal to 12059.57:

12056.04 + 219.6 delta =12059.57 → 219.6 delta =3.53 → delta≈3.53 /219.6 ≈0.0161.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.0161=109.816 MeV.

So muon's KE is E_mu -105.7=109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches perfectly.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that the neutrino's KE is indeed the same as p. Since E_nu = p, and for a massless particle, all energy is kinetic. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is treated as massless. Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the π⁺:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   For a massless particle, \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \).

4. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The total energy of the μ⁺ is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]

5. **Momentum of the Muon**:  
   Using energy conservation, we solve for \( p_{\mu^+} \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]  
   Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
   \]

### Calculations:
1. Compute \( p_{\mu^+} \):  
   Substituting \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \( (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \).  
   Then, \( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \).  
   Finally, \( p_{\mu^+} = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \).

2. Compute \( E_{\mu^+} \):  
   Using \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]  
   Calculate \( (29.78)^2 \approx 887.08 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \).  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.08 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

3. Compute Kinetic Energies:  
   - The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:  
     \[
     KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]  
   - The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its energy:  
     \[
     KE_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem states: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Here, the Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for the Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for the mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait a second, neutrinos are tricky. I remember they have very small rest masses, but in many problems, especially in particle physics, we often treat them as massless because their rest mass is negligible compared to other particles. I should confirm that. Since the muon's rest mass is given, but there's no mention for the neutrino, I think I can assume it's massless. That might simplify things.

So the decay is a pion at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of these two particles. Hmm, okay.

I remember that in particle decays, conservation of energy and momentum play a big role. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum.

Wait, but if the neutrino is massless, then its momentum is just E/c, since for massless particles, E = pc. But wait, in units where c=1, like MeV and MeV/c, it's E = p. So the muon's momentum would be equal and opposite to the neutrino's. But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero.

So, momentum of muon (p_mu) plus momentum of neutrino (p_nu) must equal zero. Since p is a vector, and they're opposite, their magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = -p_nu. Therefore, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But wait, since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum. So E_nu = p_nu. And the muon's energy would be sqrt(p_mu^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4), but since I'm dealing in MeV and c=1, it's sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2). But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

Energy conservation: The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. So:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

Which is:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p

Because E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu is p (since p_nu = p).

So I can set up the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me write that more clearly. Let me denote m_mu as 105.7 MeV, and E_pion as 139.6 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = E_pion.

Let me call this equation (1).

I need to solve for p.

Hmm, solving for p in this equation might be a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this. I can rearrange equation (1) to isolate the square root:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = E_pion - p.

Then square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (E_pion - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

(E_pion - p)^2 = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p + p².

So:

p² + m_mu² = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p + p².

I can subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = E_pion² - 2 E_pion p.

Then, rearrange to solve for p:

2 E_pion p = E_pion² - m_mu².

So,

p = (E_pion² - m_mu²) / (2 E_pion).

Plugging in the numbers:

E_pion = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Calculate numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, 139.6 squared. Let me compute 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6^2 is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 ≈ 19488.16.

Wait, actually, 139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute:

(140 - 0.4)(140 -0.4) = 140² - 2*(140)*(0.4) + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2. Let me compute 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2= 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me approximate: 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

But wait, 29*279.2= 29*(200 + 79.2) = 5800 + 2296.8 = 8096.8.

So 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So 29.783 approximately. So about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, that's p, the momentum of the muon. Because the neutrino's momentum is the same magnitude, p_nu = p.

Now, next step is to find the energies of both particles.

The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Compute (29.78)^2: approximately 887.

(105.7)^2= 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.49) ≈ let's see, sqrt(12100)=110, so sqrt(12059) is about 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 109.8^2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 = 12056.04.

Wait, but 109.8^2 is 12056.04, which is slightly less than 12059.49. So the actual E_mu is a little more than 109.8.

Hmm, let's compute 109.81^2: 109.81 * 109.81.

109 * 109 = 11881. 109 * 0.81 = 88.29, 0.81 * 109 = another 88.29, and 0.81^2=0.6561. So perhaps it's easier to just compute (109.8 + 0.01)^2 = 109.8^2 + 2 *109.8 *0.01 + (0.01)^2.

109.8^2 = 12056.04.

So 12056.04 + 2*109.8*0.01 = 12056.04 + 2.196 = 12058.236.

Plus 0.0001 → 12058.2361. Hmm, still not quite 12059.49.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that E_mu is approximately 109.8 MeV plus some.

But perhaps another approach is better. Since p = (E_pion^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 E_pion), and I've calculated p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate E_mu as:

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_mu * sqrt(1 + (p/m_mu)^2).

But m_mu is 105.7 MeV, which is much larger than p (29.78), so (p/m_mu) is about 0.2816.

So (p/m_mu)² is about 0.0793.

So sqrt(1 + 0.0793) = sqrt(1.0793) ≈ 1.0388.

So E_mu ≈ m_mu * 1.0388 = 105.7 * 1.0388 ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, as before.

But let me proceed. The muon's kinetic energy is E_mu minus its rest mass, which is 105.7 MeV.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 ≈4.1 MeV.

Wait, that's about 4.1 MeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but the problem asks for the KE of the product particles, which would be the KE of the muon and the KE of the neutrino.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless, so its energy is entirely kinetic, right? Because for a massless particle, E = pc, and the rest mass energy is zero. So the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait: the neutrino's energy is the same as its momentum p (since E=pc for massless particles when c=1). So E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

But wait, let me double-check. For a massless particle, all its energy is kinetic because E = pc and m = 0, so E = K.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

That matches closely with what I've calculated. So the KE of the muon is ~4.12 MeV (option D's first value), and the neutrino's KE is ~29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute p again.

p = (E_pion^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 E_pion).

E_pion is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

E_pion^2 = (139.6)^2 = 139.6 * 139.6.

Let me calculate this again more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6 → Let me compute 140 * 140 = 19600.

But 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 = 105.7 *105.7.

Compute 100 * 100 = 10000, 100 *5.7=570, 5.7 *100 =570, 5.7 *5.7=32.49.

So (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2=100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 =10000 + 1140 +32.49 =11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376; 8376 - 279.2 =8096.8.

279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(20 +9 +0.7) = 5584 + 2512.8 + 195.44 = 5584 +2512.8=8096.8 → +195.44 → 8292.24.

Wait, 279.2 *29.7 = 8292.24.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 more than 8292.24.

So 8315.67 - 8292.24 =23.43.

So 23.43 / 279.2 → approximately 0.0839.

So p is 29.7 + 0.0839 ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.7839 MeV/c.

So the neutrino's KE is p =29.7839 MeV.

The muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

Calculating 29.7839^2: 29.7839 *29.7839.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.7839 is approx 30 -0.2161.

So (30 -0.2161)^2 =900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2.

=900 -12.966 +0.0467= approx 887.08.

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.08 +11172.49) = sqrt(12059.57).

Compute sqrt(12059.57): Since 110^2 =12100, which is higher than 12059.57, so it's about 109.8.

Wait, 109.8^2= (110 -0.2)^2=110^2 -2*110*0.2 +0.2^2=12100-44 +0.04=12056.04.

So 12056.04 is 109.8^2.

Our value is 12059.57, which is 12056.04 +3.53.

So how much more is the sqrt? Let's compute the difference.

The value is 12059.57 → 12056.04 is 109.8^2, so difference is 3.53.

We can approximate the square root as 109.8 + delta, where delta is small.

(109.8 + delta)^2 ≈109.8^2 + 2*109.8*delta =12056.04 +219.6 delta.

Set this equal to 12059.57:

12056.04 + 219.6 delta =12059.57 → 219.6 delta =3.53 → delta≈3.53 /219.6 ≈0.0161.

So E_mu ≈109.8 +0.0161=109.816 MeV.

So muon's KE is E_mu -105.7=109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches perfectly.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that the neutrino's KE is indeed the same as p. Since E_nu = p, and for a massless particle, all energy is kinetic. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is treated as massless. Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the π⁺:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the π⁺ is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   For a massless particle, \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \).

4. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The total energy of the μ⁺ is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
   \]

5. **Momentum of the Muon**:  
   Using energy conservation, we solve for \( p_{\mu^+} \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}.
   \]  
   Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
   \]

### Calculations:
1. Compute \( p_{\mu^+} \):  
   Substituting \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \( (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \).  
   Then, \( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \).  
   Finally, \( p_{\mu^+} = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c \).

2. Compute \( E_{\mu^+} \):  
   Using \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \):  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]  
   Calculate \( (29.78)^2 \approx 887.08 \) and \( (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \).  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.08 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

3. Compute Kinetic Energies:  
   - The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:  
     \[
     KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]  
   - The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its energy:  
     \[
     KE_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
