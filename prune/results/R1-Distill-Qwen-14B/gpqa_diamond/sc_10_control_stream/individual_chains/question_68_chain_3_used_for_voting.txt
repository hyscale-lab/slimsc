Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit confused about where to start, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetic moment aligns with the field due to the Zeeman effect. The energy levels are quantized based on the spin state, either up or down.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is either up or down along Z. But when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and then turned on along Y, the spin state might change, or perhaps the energy levels change, which affects the oscillations.

Wait, spin states are eigenstates of the Sz operator when the field is along Z. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian changes, right? The Hamiltonian before the change was proportional to Sz, and after, it's proportional to Sy.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the particle remains in its initial state, which was an eigenstate of Sz (so either up or down along Z). But then, under the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy, the time evolution will cause the state to evolve, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The problem is asking about the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, mu_z. So I think the expectation value of Sz will oscillate over time.

The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz. So the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz>.

So I need to find the time dependence of <Sz> after the field is turned along Y.

Let me think about the time evolution under a Hamiltonian. The time evolution of a state is given by the time evolution operator, which depends on the Hamiltonian. The expectation value of an observable O is given by d(t) = <ψ(t)| O |ψ(t)>, where ψ(t) is the time-evolved state.

The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, say |↑_z>, because the magnetic field was along Z, so the particle's magnetic moment would be aligned. But wait, the initial state could be either spin up or down. But since the problem says it's "aligned" with the field, I think it's in the eigenstate with the same direction as the field. So probably the initial state is |↑_z>.

When the magnetic field is turned off (so no field for a moment), and then turned on in the Y direction, the new Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, so the magnetic field's vector is (0, B, 0) perhaps. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = -mu · B. So H = - gamma S · B.

Wait, the B is along Y, so direction is (0, B, 0), perhaps. So H = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the sign might depend on the direction. Let me think: the magnetic dipole energy is U = -mu · B. So if the dipole moment is mu, then H = -mu · B.

But in this case, mu is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma Sz. So H = -gamma Sz B_z. But in the new setup, B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). Therefore, H = -gamma (0*Sx + B*Sy + 0*Sz) ) = -gamma B Sy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, so H would be proportional to Sy. So H might be written as H = ω Sy, where ω is the Larmor frequency. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are given by E = ± (gamma B / 2) hbar. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the energy is proportional to the component of the magnetic moment along the field. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of Sy would be ± ħ/2 multiplied by the appropriate factors.

Wait, let's get the Hamiltonian correctly. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = - γ B (S · n), where n is the direction of the field. Here, n is along Y, so n = (0, 1, 0). So H = - γ B S_y.

Wait, wait. Wait, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, no, wait, no. mu is the magnetic moment vector, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S, which is a vector.

Wait, let me clarify. The magnetic moment mu is a vector, and it's given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is along a direction, say Y, the dipole interaction energy is U = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B). Since B is along Y, this becomes U = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = (gamma B) S_y, but perhaps with a minus sign. Wait, let's be precise.

The energy is U = - mu · B. So mu is gamma S, so U = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, S · B is S_y B. So U = - gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Or wait, perhaps the factor includes a negative sign. Let me think.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then H = - gamma B S_y.

Alternatively, some sources define the Hamiltonian as H = γ B S · n, but I'm a bit confused about the sign. Hmm. Let me think in terms of the energy levels. The energy should be proportional to S_y multiplied by some constants.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the time evolution operator. The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, say |↑_z>, which is an eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ/2. The Hamiltonian after the field is turned on is H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency. Let me see.

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels would be E = ± (ω ħ/2 ), where ω is some frequency.

But perhaps I should think about the time evolution. The initial state is |↑_z>, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of H. Because H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |↑_y> and |↓_y> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the initial state |↑_z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

Let me write this down. The |↑_y> and |↓_y> states are related to the |↑_z> and |↓_z> states. I recall that the eigenstates of S_y are |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + |↓_z>)/sqrt(2) and |↓_y> = (|↑_z> - |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), perhaps with some phase factors. Wait, actually, I might have the signs mixed up.

Wait, the eigenstates of S_y are as follows:

S_y |↑_y> = (ħ/2) |↑_y>
S_y |↓_y> = (-ħ/2) |↓_y>

Expressed in terms of S_z eigenstates:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no—actually, I think I might have to think about the ladder operators. Let me recall that S_+ = S_x + i S_y and S_- = S_x - i S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y can be written as |m> = (|↑_z> + (-1)^m i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), where m is the eigenvalue ± ħ/2. So for m = +ħ/2, |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2). For m = -ħ/2, |↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps for this problem, the exact phase doesn't matter because we're looking for the expectation value, which is real.

So the initial state is |↑_z>. Let's express this in terms of |↑_y> and |↓_y>:

|↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, let me see.

Wait, if |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), then solving for |↑_z>:

|↑_z> = |↑_y> * sqrt(2) - i |↓_y> * sqrt(2) / 1? Hmm, perhaps I should solve for |↑_z> in terms of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

Let me write it as:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

If I add these two equations:

|↑_y> + |↓_y> = [2 |↑_z> ] / sqrt(2) → (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2) = |↑_z>.

So |↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, subtracting the two:

|↑_y> - |↓_y> = (2 i |↓_z> )/ sqrt(2) → (|↑_y> - |↓_y>)/(i sqrt(2)) )= |↓_z>.

But perhaps that's getting too detailed. The key point is that the initial state |↑_z> can be expressed as a superposition of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

So when we turn on the new Hamiltonian H = ω S_y (where ω is some frequency), the time evolution is determined by the energy eigenstates |↑_y> and |↓_y>, with energies E_+ and E_-, respectively.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

Since H = ω S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the energies are E_+ = (ω ħ/2) and E_- = -(ω ħ/2). Wait, wait: wait, H = γ B S_y. Because H = - mu · B, which is -gamma S · B. So since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, earlier I thought H is H = -gamma B S_y. Let me make sure.

Yes, because mu is gamma S, so H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B = - gamma B S_y.

So H = - gamma B S_y.

So the energies are E_+ = (- gamma B ) * (ħ/2) = - (gamma B ħ)/2.

E_- = (- gamma B ) * (- ħ/2 ) = (gamma B ħ)/2.

Hmm, so the energy levels are symmetric around zero, with spacing of gamma B ħ.

But let's think about the time evolution. The initial state is |↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2). So when we apply the time evolution operator, each component evolves with its own phase.

So ψ(t) = U(t) |↑_z> = ( U(t) |↑_y> + U(t) |↓_y> ) / sqrt(2)

U(t) |↑_y> = exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |↑_y>
Similarly, U(t) |↓_y> = exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |↓_y>

So substituting E_+ and E_-,

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) )

E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) )

So,

ψ(t) = [ exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |↑_y> + exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |↓_y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we can express this state in terms of |↑_z> and |↓_z> using the expressions we derived earlier.

From earlier,

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting these into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) * (|↑_z> + i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2) + exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) * (|↑_z> - i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me factor this out:

Multiply the numerator:

= [ ( exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) ) + exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) ) ) |↑_z> / sqrt(2)
+ i ( exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) ) - exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) ) ) |↓_z> / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Because when you distribute the terms, you get:

exp(i theta) (|↑z> + i |↓z>) + exp(-i theta) (|↑z> - i |↓z> ) 

= [ exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) ] |↑z> + [i exp(i theta) - i exp(-i theta) ] |↓z>

Which is [2 cos(theta)] |↑z> + [ 2i sin(theta) ] |↓z> 

Wait, because exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos(theta), and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin(theta).

So putting it all together:

ψ(t) = [ 2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) |↑z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |↓z> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Because the denominator is sqrt(2) from each substitution, so 2 in total.

2/(2) = 1, so:

ψ(t) = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |↑z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |↓z> 

So the state at time t is a superposition of |↑z> and |↓z>, with coefficients cos(theta) and i sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) >.

But S_z |↑z> = (ħ/2) |↑z>, S_z |↓z> = (-ħ/2) |↓z>.

So:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) > 
= [ cos(theta)* <↑z| + i sin(theta)* <↓z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |↑z> + i sin(theta) |↓z> ]

Computing each term:

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) <↑z| S_z |↑z> 
+ cos(theta) * i sin(theta) <↑z| S_z |↓z> 
+ i sin(theta)* cos(theta) <↓z| S_z |↑z>
+ i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) <↓z| S_z |↓z>

But <↑z| S_z |↓z> = 0, because S_z is diagonal in the z basis.

So the cross terms vanish, and we're left with:

= cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 * (- ħ/2 )

Wait, (i sin(theta))^2 is (i^2) sin^2(theta) = (-1) sin^2(theta). So:

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

But cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, so the time dependence of <Sz> is cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me make sure. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B. So the average of the z-component of the moment, mu_z = gamma <Sz>, which would oscillate as gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ).

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>.

mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 cos( gamma B t ) )

So <mu_z> is proportional to cos(gamma B t), which oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The frequency of the oscillation is the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

But wait, I had earlier considered the time evolution of the state and found that the expectation value of Sz oscillates as cos(gamma B t) with an amplitude of ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the frequency measured is in terms of angular frequency, which is what I'm getting here. But in some contexts, frequency is given in Hz, which is cycles per second. But the question says 'oscillation frequency' without further qualification. So in this case, since the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B / (2 pi) if we're talking about Hz, but the question's options don't specify units—so probably the options are all in terms of angular frequency, so the answer is gamma B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because when I derived the expression, I used H = -gamma B S_y, which led to the energies E_+ and E_- as -(gamma B ħ/2) and +(gamma B ħ / 2). Thus, the energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The Rabi frequency is usually given by the energy difference divided by ħ, so gamma B, which would be the angular frequency. So that matches.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $| \uparrow_z \rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+Z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y
   \]
   This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.

3. **Eigenstates of $S_y$**: The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. These states can be expressed in terms of $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_z \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_y \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_z \rangle + i | \downarrow_z \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad | \downarrow_y \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_z \rangle - i | \downarrow_z \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. **Initial State in $S_y$ Basis**: The initial state $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ can be written as a superposition of $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_z \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_y \rangle + | \downarrow_y \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

5. **Time Evolution**: Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is governed by the time evolution operator:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar}
   \]
   Substituting $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the eigenstates $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$ evolve with phases determined by their eigenenergies:
   \[
   E_{\pm} = \pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}
   \]
   Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   \psi(t) = \frac{e^{i(\gamma B t/2)} | \uparrow_y \rangle + e^{-i(\gamma B t/2)} | \downarrow_y \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]
   Substituting $\psi(t)$ and using the eigenstates of $S_z$, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

7. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ corresponds to the angular frequency of the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit confused about where to start, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, its magnetic moment aligns with the field due to the Zeeman effect. The energy levels are quantized based on the spin state, either up or down.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is either up or down along Z. But when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and then turned on along Y, the spin state might change, or perhaps the energy levels change, which affects the oscillations.

Wait, spin states are eigenstates of the Sz operator when the field is along Z. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian changes, right? The Hamiltonian before the change was proportional to Sz, and after, it's proportional to Sy.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes suddenly, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the particle remains in its initial state, which was an eigenstate of Sz (so either up or down along Z). But then, under the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy, the time evolution will cause the state to evolve, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The problem is asking about the oscillation frequency of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, mu_z. So I think the expectation value of Sz will oscillate over time.

The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz. So the average mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz>.

So I need to find the time dependence of <Sz> after the field is turned along Y.

Let me think about the time evolution under a Hamiltonian. The time evolution of a state is given by the time evolution operator, which depends on the Hamiltonian. The expectation value of an observable O is given by d(t) = <ψ(t)| O |ψ(t)>, where ψ(t) is the time-evolved state.

The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, say |↑_z>, because the magnetic field was along Z, so the particle's magnetic moment would be aligned. But wait, the initial state could be either spin up or down. But since the problem says it's "aligned" with the field, I think it's in the eigenstate with the same direction as the field. So probably the initial state is |↑_z>.

When the magnetic field is turned off (so no field for a moment), and then turned on in the Y direction, the new Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, so the magnetic field's vector is (0, B, 0) perhaps. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is H = -mu · B. So H = - gamma S · B.

Wait, the B is along Y, so direction is (0, B, 0), perhaps. So H = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but the sign might depend on the direction. Let me think: the magnetic dipole energy is U = -mu · B. So if the dipole moment is mu, then H = -mu · B.

But in this case, mu is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = gamma Sz. So H = -gamma Sz B_z. But in the new setup, B is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). Therefore, H = -gamma (0*Sx + B*Sy + 0*Sz) ) = -gamma B Sy.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, so H would be proportional to Sy. So H might be written as H = ω Sy, where ω is the Larmor frequency. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are given by E = ± (gamma B / 2) hbar. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the energy is proportional to the component of the magnetic moment along the field. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of Sy would be ± ħ/2 multiplied by the appropriate factors.

Wait, let's get the Hamiltonian correctly. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = - γ B (S · n), where n is the direction of the field. Here, n is along Y, so n = (0, 1, 0). So H = - γ B S_y.

Wait, wait. Wait, mu is given as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, no, wait, no. mu is the magnetic moment vector, which is gamma times the spin vector S. So mu = gamma S, which is a vector.

Wait, let me clarify. The magnetic moment mu is a vector, and it's given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin vector. So when the magnetic field is along a direction, say Y, the dipole interaction energy is U = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B). Since B is along Y, this becomes U = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. So H = (gamma B) S_y, but perhaps with a minus sign. Wait, let's be precise.

The energy is U = - mu · B. So mu is gamma S, so U = - gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, S · B is S_y B. So U = - gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. Or wait, perhaps the factor includes a negative sign. Let me think.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = - gamma (S · B). So if B is along Y, then H = - gamma B S_y.

Alternatively, some sources define the Hamiltonian as H = γ B S · n, but I'm a bit confused about the sign. Hmm. Let me think in terms of the energy levels. The energy should be proportional to S_y multiplied by some constants.

Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy levels would be E = ± (ω ħ/2 ), where ω is some frequency.

But perhaps I should think about the time evolution. The initial state is |↑_z>, which can be written in terms of the eigenstates of H. Because H is proportional to S_y, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y, which are |↑_y> and |↓_y> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the initial state |↑_z> can be expressed as a linear combination of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

Let me write this down. The |↑_y> and |↓_y> states are related to the |↑_z> and |↓_z> states. I recall that the eigenstates of S_y are |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + |↓_z>)/sqrt(2) and |↓_y> = (|↑_z> - |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), perhaps with some phase factors. Wait, actually, I might have the signs mixed up.

Wait, the eigenstates of S_y are as follows:

S_y |↑_y> = (ħ/2) |↑_y>
S_y |↓_y> = (-ħ/2) |↓_y>

Expressed in terms of S_z eigenstates:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no—actually, I think I might have to think about the ladder operators. Let me recall that S_+ = S_x + i S_y and S_- = S_x - i S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y can be written as |m> = (|↑_z> + (-1)^m i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), where m is the eigenvalue ± ħ/2. So for m = +ħ/2, |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2). For m = -ħ/2, |↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps for this problem, the exact phase doesn't matter because we're looking for the expectation value, which is real.

So the initial state is |↑_z>. Let's express this in terms of |↑_y> and |↓_y>:

|↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2). Wait, let me see.

Wait, if |↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2), then solving for |↑_z>:

|↑_z> = |↑_y> * sqrt(2) - i |↓_y> * sqrt(2) / 1? Hmm, perhaps I should solve for |↑_z> in terms of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

Let me write it as:

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z>)/sqrt(2)

If I add these two equations:

|↑_y> + |↓_y> = [2 |↑_z> ] / sqrt(2) → (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2) = |↑_z>.

So |↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, subtracting the two:

|↑_y> - |↓_y> = (2 i |↓_z> )/ sqrt(2) → (|↑_y> - |↓_y>)/(i sqrt(2)) )= |↓_z>.

But perhaps that's getting too detailed. The key point is that the initial state |↑_z> can be expressed as a superposition of |↑_y> and |↓_y>.

So when we turn on the new Hamiltonian H = ω S_y (where ω is some frequency), the time evolution is determined by the energy eigenstates |↑_y> and |↓_y>, with energies E_+ and E_-, respectively.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp( -i H t / ħ )

Since H = ω S_y, and S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the energies are E_+ = (ω ħ/2) and E_- = -(ω ħ/2). Wait, wait: wait, H = γ B S_y. Because H = - mu · B, which is -gamma S · B. So since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, earlier I thought H is H = -gamma B S_y. Let me make sure.

Yes, because mu is gamma S, so H = - mu · B = - gamma S · B = - gamma B S_y.

So H = - gamma B S_y.

So the energies are E_+ = (- gamma B ) * (ħ/2) = - (gamma B ħ)/2.

E_- = (- gamma B ) * (- ħ/2 ) = (gamma B ħ)/2.

Hmm, so the energy levels are symmetric around zero, with spacing of gamma B ħ.

But let's think about the time evolution. The initial state is |↑_z> = (|↑_y> + |↓_y>)/sqrt(2). So when we apply the time evolution operator, each component evolves with its own phase.

So ψ(t) = U(t) |↑_z> = ( U(t) |↑_y> + U(t) |↓_y> ) / sqrt(2)

U(t) |↑_y> = exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) |↑_y>
Similarly, U(t) |↓_y> = exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |↓_y>

So substituting E_+ and E_-,

E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) )

E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2 → exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) )

So,

ψ(t) = [ exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |↑_y> + exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) |↓_y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we can express this state in terms of |↑_z> and |↓_z> using the expressions we derived earlier.

From earlier,

|↑_y> = (|↑_z> + i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2)
|↓_y> = (|↑_z> - i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2)

Substituting these into ψ(t):

ψ(t) = [ exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) * (|↑_z> + i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2) + exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) * (|↑_z> - i |↓_z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me factor this out:

Multiply the numerator:

= [ ( exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) ) + exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) ) ) |↑_z> / sqrt(2)
+ i ( exp( i (gamma B t/2 ) ) - exp( -i (gamma B t/2 ) ) ) |↓_z> / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Because when you distribute the terms, you get:

exp(i theta) (|↑z> + i |↓z>) + exp(-i theta) (|↑z> - i |↓z> ) 

= [ exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) ] |↑z> + [i exp(i theta) - i exp(-i theta) ] |↓z>

Which is [2 cos(theta)] |↑z> + [ 2i sin(theta) ] |↓z> 

Wait, because exp(i theta) + exp(-i theta) = 2 cos(theta), and exp(i theta) - exp(-i theta) = 2i sin(theta).

So putting it all together:

ψ(t) = [ 2 cos( gamma B t/2 ) |↑z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |↓z> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Because the denominator is sqrt(2) from each substitution, so 2 in total.

2/(2) = 1, so:

ψ(t) = cos( gamma B t/2 ) |↑z> + i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |↓z> 

So the state at time t is a superposition of |↑z> and |↓z>, with coefficients cos(theta) and i sin(theta), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, the expectation value of Sz is <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) >.

But S_z |↑z> = (ħ/2) |↑z>, S_z |↓z> = (-ħ/2) |↓z>.

So:

<ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) > 
= [ cos(theta)* <↑z| + i sin(theta)* <↓z| ] S_z [ cos(theta) |↑z> + i sin(theta) |↓z> ]

Computing each term:

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) <↑z| S_z |↑z> 
+ cos(theta) * i sin(theta) <↑z| S_z |↓z> 
+ i sin(theta)* cos(theta) <↓z| S_z |↑z>
+ i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) <↓z| S_z |↓z>

But <↑z| S_z |↓z> = 0, because S_z is diagonal in the z basis.

So the cross terms vanish, and we're left with:

= cos^2(theta) * (ħ/2) + (i sin(theta))^2 * (- ħ/2 )

Wait, (i sin(theta))^2 is (i^2) sin^2(theta) = (-1) sin^2(theta). So:

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

But cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta )

But theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

Thus, <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, so the time dependence of <Sz> is cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me make sure. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine, which is gamma B. So the average of the z-component of the moment, mu_z = gamma <Sz>, which would oscillate as gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ).

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of <mu_z>.

mu_z = gamma <Sz> = gamma ( ħ/2 cos( gamma B t ) )

So <mu_z> is proportional to cos(gamma B t), which oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The frequency of the oscillation is the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine. So yes, the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

But wait, I had earlier considered the time evolution of the state and found that the expectation value of Sz oscillates as cos(gamma B t) with an amplitude of ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, sometimes the frequency measured is in terms of angular frequency, which is what I'm getting here. But in some contexts, frequency is given in Hz, which is cycles per second. But the question says 'oscillation frequency' without further qualification. So in this case, since the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency would be gamma B / (2 pi) if we're talking about Hz, but the question's options don't specify units—so probably the options are all in terms of angular frequency, so the answer is gamma B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because when I derived the expression, I used H = -gamma B S_y, which led to the energies E_+ and E_- as -(gamma B ħ/2) and +(gamma B ħ / 2). Thus, the energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. The Rabi frequency is usually given by the energy difference divided by ħ, so gamma B, which would be the angular frequency. So that matches.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is then turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in an eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $| \uparrow_z \rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+Z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y
   \]
   This Hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the system.

3. **Eigenstates of $S_y$**: The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. These states can be expressed in terms of $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_z \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_y \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_z \rangle + i | \downarrow_z \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad | \downarrow_y \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_z \rangle - i | \downarrow_z \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

4. **Initial State in $S_y$ Basis**: The initial state $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ can be written as a superposition of $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_z \rangle = \frac{| \uparrow_y \rangle + | \downarrow_y \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

5. **Time Evolution**: Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is governed by the time evolution operator:
   \[
   U(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar}
   \]
   Substituting $H = -\gamma B S_y$, the eigenstates $| \uparrow_y \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_y \rangle$ evolve with phases determined by their eigenenergies:
   \[
   E_{\pm} = \pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}
   \]
   Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   \psi(t) = \frac{e^{i(\gamma B t/2)} | \uparrow_y \rangle + e^{-i(\gamma B t/2)} | \downarrow_y \rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle
   \]
   Substituting $\psi(t)$ and using the eigenstates of $S_z$, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
   \]

7. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ corresponds to the angular frequency of the cosine term, which is $\gamma B$. Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
