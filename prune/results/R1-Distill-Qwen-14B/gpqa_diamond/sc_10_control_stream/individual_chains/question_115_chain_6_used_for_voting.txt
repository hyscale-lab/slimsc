Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles collide, they can annihilate and produce energy, like photons. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact specifics, so let me think through this.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Oh wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? And the positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, they're moving towards each other. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so since they are an electron and a positron, their rest masses are the same. The electron has charge -e, and the positron +e. But in terms of mass, they are both m_e, the electron mass.

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce photons. Since the total energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' energies and directions must be such that these are maintained.

First, I should probably calculate the total energy and momentum before annihilation. Then, using conservation laws, figure out the properties of the photons.

Let me start by finding the energies and momenta of both particles before collision.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = E / (m_e c²). So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so its energy E_e is gamma_e * m_e c² =4 m_e c².

Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so E_p = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

Wait, but positron and electron have same mass, so their rest energies are the same. So total energy before annihilation is E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite to the electron. So their momenta might be opposite in direction.

The momentum p is gamma m_e v. But another expression is p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e (c² / sqrt(1 + (v²/c²))) ) Wait, actually, another way: p = gamma m_e v, and since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ), but perhaps a better approach is to remember that p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c² (v/(c²)) ) but maybe using p = gamma m_e v.

Alternatively, since p² c² = (E)^2 - (m_e c²)^2. So for the electron, E_e =4 m_e c², so its momentum p_e is sqrt( (E_e)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, let me get the units right.

Wait, the relation is E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c². Wait, actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, if you solve for p, you have:

p = sqrt( (E/(c²))² - m² ) * c.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to write p = gamma m_e v, and since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then v can be found from gamma.

So for the electron, gamma_e =4.

So, gamma_e =4. So 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)=1/4 => 1 - v_e²/c²=1/16 => v_e²/c²=15/16 => v_e = (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ≈ (3.87298/4) c ≈ 0.968 c.

Wait, but wait, that's v_e for the electron. Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2.

gamma_p=2: 2=1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²)=1/2 => 1 - v_p²/c²=1/4 => v_p²/c²=3/4 => v_p=(sqrt(3)/2 ) c ≈ 0.866 c.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron's. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). Wait no, wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is towards the left, opposite to the electron's.

So the electron's velocity is positive (say, along +x), and the positron's is negative (along -x).

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p.

But wait, the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p would be gamma_p m_e v_p, which is negative because v_p is negative.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left (the same direction as the electron's movement is to the right). So, let's say the electron is moving in the positive x direction, and the positron in the negative x direction.

So, let me compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ≈ (3.873)/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

So,

p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Because 4 and denominator 4 cancel.

Similarly, for the positron:

v_p = (sqrt(3)/2 ) c ≈ 0.866 c, but in the negative x direction.

So, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.

So, the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p.

p_total_initial = (m_e sqrt(15) c )  + ( - m_e sqrt(3) c )

= m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Hmm, let me compute the numerical value. Sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

So, 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So p_total_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, the momentum of the positron is negative, so when adding p_e and p_p, we subtract their magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the signs correctly.

Electron: moving right (positive x), so p_e is positive.

Positron: moving left (negative x), so p_p is negative.

So, p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = (m_e c sqrt(15 )) + ( - m_e c sqrt(3) )

Which is m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ≈ positive value, as above.

So, the total momentum is in the positive x direction.

Now, after annihilation, the system produces two photons. The photons have same energy, E1 = E2 = E_photon.

The total energy after is E_photon + E_photon = 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c², as earlier.

So, 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon =3 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, the rest energy of an electron is m_e c². So each photon has 3 times that. Hmm, but that's okay because the photons can carry any energy as long as conservation is satisfied.

Now, the photons are moving in opposite directions, but both to the right. Wait, no, one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions.

Wait, but if both photons are moving to the right, then their momenta would be in the same direction, but with different angles. But wait, photons carry momentum in the direction of their propagation, and their momentum magnitudes are E/c, where E is the photon's energy.

Wait, but if both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum would be the same, each being E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c =3 m_e c.

So each photon has p_photon =3 m_e c in magnitude.

But their directions are different. Let's model this. Let me imagine that one photon is moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and the other at an angle phi below the x-axis. But since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, both are moving in the right direction but in the upper and lower parts of the right hemisphere.

In terms of momentum vectors, each photon's momentum vector would have components:

For the first photon (upper-right): p1x = p_photon * cos(theta), p1y = p_photon * sin(theta).

For the second photon (lower-right): p2x = p_photon * cos(phi), p2y = - p_photon * sin(phi).

Wait, but wait, if both are moving to the right, then phi would be the angle below the x-axis, so the sine component would be negative. So the second photon has p2y = - p_photon sin(phi).

But wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps the first is at +theta, the other at -theta, but maybe not necessarily symmetric. But in reality, the angles could be the same magnitude but opposite in sign. Hmm, but the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps I shouldn't assume that.

But given that the photons have the same energy, but their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Now, the total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before.

So, the total momentum after is the vector sum of the two photon momenta.

So,

p_total_final_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) )

p_total_final_y = p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c ( sin(theta) - sin(phi) )

Because p2y is negative, so it's - sin(phi).

Wait, no, if the second photon is moving in the lower-right direction, phi is measured as a positive angle below the x-axis. So p2y would be negative, so p2y = -3 m_e c sin(phi).

So, p_total_final_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta) - 3 m_e c sin(phi).

But since the total momentum before was only along the x-axis (p_total_initial_y =0), the total momentum after must also have y-component zero. So,

p_total_final_y =0 → 3 m_e c ( sin(theta) - sin(phi) ) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

Hmm, but wait, the photons have the same energy and are moving in opposite directions in terms of y, but same in x.

Wait, but wait, I should clarify: the positron is moving left, electron right, so their momenta are in opposite directions. But after annihilation, the two photons must carry away the total momentum.

But the initial momentum was along the x-axis. So, the total momentum after must also be along x-axis, meaning that the sum of the y-components of the two photons' momenta must be zero.

So,

Sum of y-components: p1y + p2y = 0 → p1y = - p2y.

So,

p_photon sin(theta) = - p_photon sin(phi).

But since p_photon is same for both,

sin(theta) = - sin(phi) → phi = - theta, because sin is an odd function.

So, phi = - theta. So the two angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So one is at + theta, the other at - theta.

But in the problem statement, it's said that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which fits this scenario.

So, the angles are theta and -theta. But the options don't give negative angles, so the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.

Wait, but the question asks for the angle between their directions. Since one is at +theta, the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Now, the x-components must add up to the initial total momentum.

p_total_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

But,

p_total_final_x =3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) )

But since phi = - theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta), so,

p_total_final_x =3 m_e c ( 2 cos(theta) ) =6 m_e c cos(theta).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m_e c,

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6

Let me compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So,

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So,

cos(theta)=0.35682 → theta= arccos(0.35682).

What's arccos(0.3568)? Let me think. Cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. 0.3568 is between 70 and 60, closer to 70.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, cos(69 degrees) is cos(1.204 radians) ≈ 0.3584. Oh, wait, that's very close to 0.3568. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me think: 69 degrees is 69 * pi/180 ≈1.204 radians.

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584.

Wait, but our value is 0.3568, which is slightly less. So, maybe about 69.5 degrees? Let's see:

cos(69.5°) → approximately 0.355.

Wait, perhaps 69.2 degrees: let me compute cos(69.2):

Using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute this angle numerically.

But perhaps I can just proceed without finding theta numerically, because I'm looking for the angle between the two photons, which is 2 theta.

So, 2 theta = 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 )

But wait, let me compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity I can use.

Wait, another approach: the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, as each photon is at theta above and below the x-axis.

So, the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, I can compute 2 theta using the value of cos(theta).

But let's find theta first.

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 ≈ (3.87298 −1.73205)/6≈ 2.14093/6≈0.35682.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but let me calculate it more precisely.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.35682):

I know that cos(60) =0.5, cos(70)=0.3420. 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Compute cos(69) ≈0.3584. So 69 degrees: 0.3584.

Our value is 0.3568, which is 0.3584 - 0.0016. So, each degree contributes about a certain amount.

But perhaps it's easier to think that 69 degrees gives cos=0.3584, and 0.3568 is 0.0016 less. So, perhaps the angle is about 69.2 degrees, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's 69 degrees and something.

But regardless, let's proceed.

The angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which would be about 138 degrees.

Wait, because if theta is 69 degrees, then 2 theta is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, what's 2 theta if theta is 69 degrees? 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons would be 138 degrees.

But let's verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the angles is more than 90, but I think 138 is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute tan(theta) from the momentum.

Because I have the x and y components.

Wait, the total momentum after must match the initial momentum.

We know that the initial momentum is along x, so the sum of the y components is zero.

Which we've already used, so the angle between the photons is 2 theta.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute theta through another method.

Let me think about the momentum.

The initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The final momentum in x is 6 m_e c cos(theta).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.

Let me compute that numerically:

sqrt(15)≈3.87298,

sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.

2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So,

theta = arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

So, the angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈138 degrees, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the options:

Options:
A) 74
B) 172
C) 138
D) 96

Yes, option C is 138.

So, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - Both particles have the same rest mass, \( m_e \).

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - Total energy before annihilation:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
     \]
   - After annihilation, the total energy is carried by two photons with equal energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
     \]

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The electron and positron have opposite directions, so their momenta are:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e c \sqrt{15}
     \]
     \[
     p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e c \sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Total initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy and move in opposite directions. Their momenta are equal in magnitude:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
     \]
   - Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \( \theta \) (upper-right) and \( -\theta \) (lower-right). The x- and y-components of their momenta are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{1y} = 3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]
     \[
     p_{2x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{2y} = -3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]

5. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before annihilation. Since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel:
     \[
     p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0 \implies \sin\theta = \sin(-\theta) \implies \theta = -\theta
     \]
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta add up to the total initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 6 m_e c \cos\theta
     \]
     Substituting \( p_{\text{total}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \):
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
     Dividing through by \( m_e c \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

6. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
     \]
   - Find \( \theta \):
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ
     \]
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \):
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles collide, they can annihilate and produce energy, like photons. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact specifics, so let me think through this.

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Oh wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? And the positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, they're moving towards each other. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so since they are an electron and a positron, their rest masses are the same. The electron has charge -e, and the positron +e. But in terms of mass, they are both m_e, the electron mass.

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce photons. Since the total energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' energies and directions must be such that these are maintained.

First, I should probably calculate the total energy and momentum before annihilation. Then, using conservation laws, figure out the properties of the photons.

Let me start by finding the energies and momenta of both particles before collision.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = E / (m_e c²). So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so its energy E_e is gamma_e * m_e c² =4 m_e c².

Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so E_p = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

Wait, but positron and electron have same mass, so their rest energies are the same. So total energy before annihilation is E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite to the electron. So their momenta might be opposite in direction.

The momentum p is gamma m_e v. But another expression is p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e (c² / sqrt(1 + (v²/c²))) ) Wait, actually, another way: p = gamma m_e v, and since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ), but perhaps a better approach is to remember that p = gamma m_e v = gamma m_e c² (v/(c²)) ) but maybe using p = gamma m_e v.

Alternatively, since p² c² = (E)^2 - (m_e c²)^2. So for the electron, E_e =4 m_e c², so its momentum p_e is sqrt( (E_e)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, let me get the units right.

Wait, the relation is E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c². Wait, actually, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So,

p = sqrt( E² - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, if you solve for p, you have:

p = sqrt( (E/(c²))² - m² ) * c.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to write p = gamma m_e v, and since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then v can be found from gamma.

So for the electron, gamma_e =4.

So, gamma_e =4. So 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²)=1/4 => 1 - v_e²/c²=1/16 => v_e²/c²=15/16 => v_e = (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ≈ (3.87298/4) c ≈ 0.968 c.

Wait, but wait, that's v_e for the electron. Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2.

gamma_p=2: 2=1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) => sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²)=1/2 => 1 - v_p²/c²=1/4 => v_p²/c²=3/4 => v_p=(sqrt(3)/2 ) c ≈ 0.866 c.

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron's. So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). Wait no, wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is towards the left, opposite to the electron's.

So the electron's velocity is positive (say, along +x), and the positron's is negative (along -x).

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p.

But wait, the positron's velocity is in the opposite direction, so v_p is negative. So p_p would be gamma_p m_e v_p, which is negative because v_p is negative.

Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is towards the left (the same direction as the electron's movement is to the right). So, let's say the electron is moving in the positive x direction, and the positron in the negative x direction.

So, let me compute p_e and p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = (sqrt(15)/4 ) c ≈ (3.873)/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

So,

p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Because 4 and denominator 4 cancel.

Similarly, for the positron:

v_p = (sqrt(3)/2 ) c ≈ 0.866 c, but in the negative x direction.

So, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e * sqrt(3) c.

So, the total momentum before collision is p_e + p_p.

p_total_initial = (m_e sqrt(15) c )  + ( - m_e sqrt(3) c )

= m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Hmm, let me compute the numerical value. Sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

So, 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So p_total_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, the momentum of the positron is negative, so when adding p_e and p_p, we subtract their magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the signs correctly.

Electron: moving right (positive x), so p_e is positive.

Positron: moving left (negative x), so p_p is negative.

So, p_total_initial = p_e + p_p = (m_e c sqrt(15 )) + ( - m_e c sqrt(3) )

Which is m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ≈ positive value, as above.

So, the total momentum is in the positive x direction.

Now, after annihilation, the system produces two photons. The photons have same energy, E1 = E2 = E_photon.

The total energy after is E_photon + E_photon = 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c², as earlier.

So, 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon =3 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, the rest energy of an electron is m_e c². So each photon has 3 times that. Hmm, but that's okay because the photons can carry any energy as long as conservation is satisfied.

Now, the photons are moving in opposite directions, but both to the right. Wait, no, one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in different vertical directions.

Wait, but if both photons are moving to the right, then their momenta would be in the same direction, but with different angles. But wait, photons carry momentum in the direction of their propagation, and their momentum magnitudes are E/c, where E is the photon's energy.

Wait, but if both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum would be the same, each being E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c =3 m_e c.

So each photon has p_photon =3 m_e c in magnitude.

But their directions are different. Let's model this. Let me imagine that one photon is moving at an angle theta above the x-axis, and the other at an angle phi below the x-axis. But since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, both are moving in the right direction but in the upper and lower parts of the right hemisphere.

In terms of momentum vectors, each photon's momentum vector would have components:

For the first photon (upper-right): p1x = p_photon * cos(theta), p1y = p_photon * sin(theta).

For the second photon (lower-right): p2x = p_photon * cos(phi), p2y = - p_photon * sin(phi).

Wait, but wait, if both are moving to the right, then phi would be the angle below the x-axis, so the sine component would be negative. So the second photon has p2y = - p_photon sin(phi).

But wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So perhaps the first is at +theta, the other at -theta, but maybe not necessarily symmetric. But in reality, the angles could be the same magnitude but opposite in sign. Hmm, but the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps I shouldn't assume that.

But given that the photons have the same energy, but their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

Now, the total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before.

So, the total momentum after is the vector sum of the two photon momenta.

So,

p_total_final_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) )

p_total_final_y = p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c ( sin(theta) - sin(phi) )

Because p2y is negative, so it's - sin(phi).

Wait, no, if the second photon is moving in the lower-right direction, phi is measured as a positive angle below the x-axis. So p2y would be negative, so p2y = -3 m_e c sin(phi).

So, p_total_final_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta) - 3 m_e c sin(phi).

But since the total momentum before was only along the x-axis (p_total_initial_y =0), the total momentum after must also have y-component zero. So,

p_total_final_y =0 → 3 m_e c ( sin(theta) - sin(phi) ) =0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

Hmm, but wait, the photons have the same energy and are moving in opposite directions in terms of y, but same in x.

Wait, but wait, I should clarify: the positron is moving left, electron right, so their momenta are in opposite directions. But after annihilation, the two photons must carry away the total momentum.

But the initial momentum was along the x-axis. So, the total momentum after must also be along x-axis, meaning that the sum of the y-components of the two photons' momenta must be zero.

So,

Sum of y-components: p1y + p2y = 0 → p1y = - p2y.

So,

p_photon sin(theta) = - p_photon sin(phi).

But since p_photon is same for both,

sin(theta) = - sin(phi) → phi = - theta, because sin is an odd function.

So, phi = - theta. So the two angles are symmetric about the x-axis. So one is at + theta, the other at - theta.

But in the problem statement, it's said that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which fits this scenario.

So, the angles are theta and -theta. But the options don't give negative angles, so the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.

Wait, but the question asks for the angle between their directions. Since one is at +theta, the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Now, the x-components must add up to the initial total momentum.

p_total_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

But,

p_total_final_x =3 m_e c ( cos(theta) + cos(phi) )

But since phi = - theta, cos(phi) = cos(theta), so,

p_total_final_x =3 m_e c ( 2 cos(theta) ) =6 m_e c cos(theta).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Divide both sides by m_e c,

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6

Let me compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So,

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So,

cos(theta)=0.35682 → theta= arccos(0.35682).

What's arccos(0.3568)? Let me think. Cos(60 degrees) is 0.5, cos(70) is about 0.3420. 0.3568 is between 70 and 60, closer to 70.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, cos(69 degrees) is cos(1.204 radians) ≈ 0.3584. Oh, wait, that's very close to 0.3568. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me think: 69 degrees is 69 * pi/180 ≈1.204 radians.

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584.

Wait, but our value is 0.3568, which is slightly less. So, maybe about 69.5 degrees? Let's see:

cos(69.5°) → approximately 0.355.

Wait, perhaps 69.2 degrees: let me compute cos(69.2):

Using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute this angle numerically.

But perhaps I can just proceed without finding theta numerically, because I'm looking for the angle between the two photons, which is 2 theta.

So, 2 theta = 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 )

But wait, let me compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity I can use.

Wait, another approach: the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, as each photon is at theta above and below the x-axis.

So, the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, I can compute 2 theta using the value of cos(theta).

But let's find theta first.

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 ≈ (3.87298 −1.73205)/6≈ 2.14093/6≈0.35682.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but let me calculate it more precisely.

Using a calculator, arccos(0.35682):

I know that cos(60) =0.5, cos(70)=0.3420. 0.3568 is between 69 and 70 degrees.

Compute cos(69) ≈0.3584. So 69 degrees: 0.3584.

Our value is 0.3568, which is 0.3584 - 0.0016. So, each degree contributes about a certain amount.

But perhaps it's easier to think that 69 degrees gives cos=0.3584, and 0.3568 is 0.0016 less. So, perhaps the angle is about 69.2 degrees, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's 69 degrees and something.

But regardless, let's proceed.

The angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which would be about 138 degrees.

Wait, because if theta is 69 degrees, then 2 theta is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, what's 2 theta if theta is 69 degrees? 138 degrees. So the angle between the two photons would be 138 degrees.

But let's verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the angles is more than 90, but I think 138 is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute tan(theta) from the momentum.

Because I have the x and y components.

Wait, the total momentum after must match the initial momentum.

We know that the initial momentum is along x, so the sum of the y components is zero.

Which we've already used, so the angle between the photons is 2 theta.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute theta through another method.

Let me think about the momentum.

The initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The final momentum in x is 6 m_e c cos(theta).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.

Let me compute that numerically:

sqrt(15)≈3.87298,

sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.

2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So,

theta = arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

So, the angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈138 degrees, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me check the options:

Options:
A) 74
B) 172
C) 138
D) 96

Yes, option C is 138.

So, the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - Both particles have the same rest mass, \( m_e \).

2. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - Total energy before annihilation:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
     \]
   - After annihilation, the total energy is carried by two photons with equal energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
     \]

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The electron and positron have opposite directions, so their momenta are:
     \[
     p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c = m_e c \sqrt{15}
     \]
     \[
     p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c = m_e c \sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Total initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - After annihilation, the two photons have equal energy and move in opposite directions. Their momenta are equal in magnitude:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
     \]
   - Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \( \theta \) (upper-right) and \( -\theta \) (lower-right). The x- and y-components of their momenta are:
     \[
     p_{1x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{1y} = 3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]
     \[
     p_{2x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \quad p_{2y} = -3 m_e c \sin\theta
     \]

5. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before annihilation. Since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel:
     \[
     p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 0 \implies \sin\theta = \sin(-\theta) \implies \theta = -\theta
     \]
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta add up to the total initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 6 m_e c \cos\theta
     \]
     Substituting \( p_{\text{total}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \):
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
     Dividing through by \( m_e c \):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

6. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Compute \( \cos\theta \):
     \[
     \sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
     \]
   - Find \( \theta \):
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ
     \]
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \):
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ
     \]

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
