Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Hmm, let's break it down. 

So the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, right? The idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam. But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path λ1 based on the sample compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path... I remember that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule's diameter, and p is pressure. Oh wait, or was it something else? Maybe λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), yeah that sounds right. 

He found λ1 under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. But when he started the electron beam, the mean free path became λ2, and it's not the same as λ1. The temperature remained the same, so T didn't change. So what's different here? 

Wait, the electron beam is being used. Electrons are being fired at the sample. Oh, right, gas molecules can scatter electrons. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Hmm... I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, I think about electron scattering and gas molecules. The electron beam will interact with the gas particles. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might get ionized or excited, or maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to move more. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the pressure. 

Wait, no, the pressure is already ultra-low, so maybe the beam's energy isn't causing a significant change in pressure. But another thought: the mean free path is about how the gas molecules move. When the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being hit by electrons more often, which would change their movement. Like, the electrons are another factor causing collisions for the gas molecules. 

Oh! So in the initial condition (without the electron beam), the mean free path λ1 is determined by the gas molecules colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also collide with the electrons. So each gas molecule now has more ways to collide—either with other gas molecules or with the electrons. 

So the effective pressure or the effective 'collision rate' would increase because the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons. That would decrease the mean free path, because they're colliding more frequently. So λ2 should be less than λ1. 

Wait, that makes sense. The mean free path depends inversely on the pressure and the number of collisions. If there are more collisions (because of the beam), the mean free path would be shorter. So λ2 < λ1. 

So looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: No, mean free path would decrease.

B) λ2 = λ1: No, because the scenario says it's not equal.

C) λ2 < λ1: Yes, this fits our reasoning.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: No, same as C but opposite.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum chamber changes when an electron beam is introduced. Initially, Mike calculates the mean free path, λ1, under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr), where the mean free path is determined by collisions between gas molecules. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The temperature remains constant, so the change in λ must be due to additional factors introduced by the electron beam.

The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate. In the absence of the electron beam, collisions occur only between gas molecules. When the electron beam is turned on, gas molecules can now collide with the electrons in addition to colliding with each other. This increases the overall collision rate, which reduces the mean free path. Therefore, λ2 is shorter than λ1.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: Incorrect, as the mean free path decreases due to increased collisions.
- **B) λ2 = λ1**: Incorrect, as the scenario explicitly states that λ2 ≠ λ1.
- **C) λ2 < λ1**: Correct, as the increased collision rate caused by the electron beam reduces the mean free path.
- **D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1**: Incorrect, as the mean free path decreases, not increases.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.
