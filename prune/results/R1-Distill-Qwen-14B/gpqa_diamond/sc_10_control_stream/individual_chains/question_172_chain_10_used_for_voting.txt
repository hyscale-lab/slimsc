Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles across energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2. So for the same energy level, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Let me denote n1 as the population in star_1 and n2 as star_2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait, applying the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). Or wait, maybe I have to think about it differently. Because the ratio is n1/(n_total) vs n2/(n_total), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think that for each star, the ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, no. The question says that the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same specific energy level, same ΔE. So the ratio of the populations in each star would be determined by each star's temperature.

So for star_1, the ratio of excited to lower state is n_upper1/n_lower1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star_2, n_upper2/n_lower2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio n_upper1/n_lower1 is twice that of n_upper2/n_lower2. So: (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2 (n_upper2/n_lower2).

Let me write the equations. Let me denote the lower state as L and upper as U. So for star_1: U1/L1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Star_2: U2/L2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the problem says U1/L1 = 2 * (U2/L2). So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, because if the excitation is higher in star_1, that suggests that more atoms are in the upper energy level compared to the lower one. Which would happen if T is higher because higher temperatures favor higher energy states.

Wait, let's get the ratios right. The ratio U/L is higher when temperature is higher because exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller when T is bigger. Wait, no. Because as T increases, denominator k T increases, so ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is less negative, so exp of a smaller negative is larger. So higher T → higher U/L ratio.

So if star_1 has higher excitation (U/L ratio), then T1 is higher than T2. So T1 > T2.

But the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (U1/L1) = 2 (U2/L2).

So using the Boltzmann expressions, U1/L1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and U2/L2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln( 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

So,

(ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Hmm, so:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2).

So,

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

But in the problem statement, the ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, what's the value of k? Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wow, that's the same as the given ΔE.

So ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So substituting back into the equation:

(1 K) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) = ln(2).

Hmm, looking at the options, let me see which one matches this.

Wait, the left-hand side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let's see the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches what we have. Because our equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the answer would be option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution governs the population of atoms in energy levels, and the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms is given by:

\[
\frac{U}{L} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation levels are related by:

\[
\frac{U_1}{L_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{U_2}{L_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation provided in option D. Therefore, the correct relationship between the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Hmm, so:
