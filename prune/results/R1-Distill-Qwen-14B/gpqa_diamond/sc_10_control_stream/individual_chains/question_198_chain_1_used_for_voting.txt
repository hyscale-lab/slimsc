Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

We've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so the blue dithiocynato would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, I think. Because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So that's the third complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+? Wait, no, let me check the numbering. The β values are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So for each complex, the β is the formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, I remember that the stability constant (β) for a complex indicates the tendency to form. For a metal ion M^n+ and ligand L, the formation of ML_m is given by β_m = [ML_m]/([M][L]^m). So for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

In this case, the Co complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_1^+ (β1=9)
Co^2+ + 2SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^(0) (β2=40)
Co^2+ + 3SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)
Co^2+ + 4SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16)

Wait, but the charges need to balance. Let me check:

Co^2+ with one SCN- (which is -1 each) would be CoSCN^+ (2+ + (-1) = +1). For two SCN-, Co(SCN)_2^0: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Three SCN- would be CoSCN3^- (2+ +3*(-1)= -1), and four SCN- would be CoSCN4^2- (2+ +4*(-1)= -2). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex, β2=40.

So I need to find the fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 compared to all possible Co species.

So to find the percentage, I think I need to compute the mole fractions of each complex, sum them up, and then find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex (the one with two SCN-).

But to do that, I need to know the distribution of Co between the different complexes. Since the formation of these complexes depends on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-, and the stability constants, the distribution can be found using the formation constants.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution. For each complex, the fraction is given by the formation constant multiplied by the appropriate power of [SCN-], divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, more formally, the fraction f_m of the complex with m ligands is:

f_m = (β_m [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m ) / Σ (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

But since [Co^2+] is the same in all terms and appears in numerator and denominator, it can be canceled out. So f_m = (β_m [SCN^-]^m ) / Σ (β_n [SCN^-]^n )

In our case, m can be 1,2,3,4. So summing over n=1 to 4.

Wait, but wait. [Co^2+] is the total concentration of all Co species. So the total [Co] is [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But in the problem statement, the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is given as 1e-2 M. So the sum of all these species equals 1e-2 M.

But for the purpose of calculating the fractions, perhaps we can model each complex's concentration as [Co] * (β_m [SCN]^m) / (sum β_n [SCN]^n over n=1 to 4 )

Wait, but the initial Co is Co^2+. So the distribution is:

Each complex's concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by β_m [SCN]^m / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN]^n )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The total concentration of Co is given as the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each of these can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the formation constants.

For example, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]^1
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co^2+][SCN-]^4

So, the total [Co] is [Co^2+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, [Co^2+] is the free ion, and the other terms are the complex concentrations.

So the fraction of each complex is [complex]/c_total.

So for the complex with m SCN-, its fraction is:

([β_m [SCN]^m [Co^2+]]) / c_total.

But since [Co^2+] = c_total / (sum terms), that becomes (β_m [SCN]^m ) / (sum terms )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the sum of β_m [SCN]^m for each m, and then the fraction is β_m [SCN]^m divided by the total sum.

Yes, so:

Let's calculate S = β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Then, the fraction of the m=2 complex is (β2 [SCN]^2) / S.

So, the percentage is (β2 [SCN]^2) / S multiplied by 100.

So, let's compute each term.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1 (m=1): β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9

Term2 (m=2): 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term3 (m=3): 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

Term4 (m=4): 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

So sum S = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute:

0.9 + 0.4 is 1.3.

1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363.

1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.

So S ≈ 1.3646.

Then, the fraction for m=2 is 0.4 / 1.3646.

Let me compute that: 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2928.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 29.28%.

Wait, but none of the options are around 29%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's confusing. So either I made a mistake in my approach or calculations.

Wait, perhaps I missed a term. Let's re-examine the problem. Oh! Wait a second, the initial Co^2+ is present, but the sum S as I computed it is only for the complexes. But the free Co^2+ is also part of the total.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

The problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. So the total cobalt includes all species: Co^2+ plus all the complexes.

So the sum of all the Co species (free and complexes) is 1e-2 M.

But in my earlier approach, I considered the fractions as (β_m [SCN]^m ) / S, where S includes the β terms. But perhaps I should also include the free Co^2+ in the sum.

Wait, no. Because the sum S, as I computed, was the sum of β_m [SCN]^m terms. But actually, the total concentration c_total is related to [Co^2+] via:

c_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which can be rewritten as:

[Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + S )

Where S is the sum of the β_m [SCN]^m terms (m=1 to 4).

So S is 1.3646 as computed earlier.

So [Co^2+] = (1e-2) / (1 + 1.3646) = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.226e-3 M.

So the concentration of Co^2+ is 4.226e-3 M.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0. So the concentration of that is [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Which is 40 * 4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2.

Let me compute that:

40 * 4.226e-3 = 40 * ~0.004226 ≈ 0.16904.

Multiply by (0.1)^2 = 0.01: 0.16904 * 0.01 = 0.0016904 M.

But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the fraction is 0.0016904 / 0.01 = 0.16904, which is 16.904%. So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but that's not matching my earlier approach. Earlier, I thought the fraction was about 29%, but that approach didn't account for the free Co^2+ correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

If [Co(SCN)_2^0] is given by β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2, then the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2^0] / c_total.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2.

But [Co^2+] is c_total / (1 + S ), where S is the sum of β_m [SCN]^m.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * (c_total/(1 + S )) * [SCN]^2.

So the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2^0]/c_total = (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + S )

Ah, that's an important point I missed earlier. So the fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + S )

So now, let me compute that.

Earlier, S was the sum from m=1 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m, which was 1.3646.

So 1 + S is 2.3646.

So (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + S ) = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, that's one of the options, option D.

So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)_2^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

The total cobalt concentration includes all species:  
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

The fraction of cobalt in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 is given by:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
For each complex, calculate the contribution using \( \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m \):  
- \( \text{Term}_1 = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \text{Term}_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \text{Term}_3 = \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \text{Term}_4 = \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The sum of these terms is:  
\[
S = \text{Term}_1 + \text{Term}_2 + \text{Term}_3 + \text{Term}_4 = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^0
The fraction of cobalt in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 is:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{1 + S} = \frac{0.4}{1 + 1.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of Co(SCN)_2^0 is:  
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again.

We've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, so the blue dithiocynato would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, I think. Because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So that's the third complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+?

In this case, the Co complexes would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_1^+ (β1=9)
Co^2+ + 2SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2^(0) (β2=40)
Co^2+ + 3SCN^- → Co(SCN)_3^- (β3=63)
Co^2+ + 4SCN^- → Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4=16)

Wait, but the charges need to balance. Let me check:

Co^2+ with one SCN- (which is -1 each) would be CoSCN^+ (2+ + (-1) = +1). For two SCN-, Co(SCN)_2^0: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. Three SCN- would be CoSCN3^- (2+ +3*(-1)= -1), and four SCN- would be CoSCN4^2- (2+ +4*(-1)= -2). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, right? So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex, β2=40.

So I need to find the fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 compared to all possible Co species.

So to find the percentage, I think I need to compute the mole fractions of each complex, sum them up, and then find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato complex (the one with two SCN-).

But to do that, I need to know the distribution of Co between the different complexes. Since the formation of these complexes depends on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-, and the stability constants, the distribution can be found using the formation constants.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex in the solution. For each complex, the fraction is given by the formation constant multiplied by the appropriate power of [SCN-], divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, more formally, the fraction f_m of the complex with m ligands is:

f_m = (β_m [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^m ) / Σ (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n )

But since [Co^2+] is the same in all terms and appears in numerator and denominator, it can be canceled out. So f_m = (β_m [SCN^-]^m ) / Σ (β_n [SCN^-]^n )

In our case, m can be 1,2,3,4. So summing over n=1 to 4.

Wait, but wait. [Co^2+] is the total concentration of all Co species. So the total [Co] is [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But in the problem statement, the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is given as 1e-2 M. So the sum of all these species equals 1e-2 M.

But for the purpose of calculating the fractions, perhaps we can model each complex's concentration as [Co] * (β_m [SCN]^m) / (sum β_n [SCN]^n over n=1 to 4 )

Wait, but the initial Co is Co^2+. So the distribution is:

Each complex's concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by β_m [SCN]^m / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 β_n [SCN]^n )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The total concentration of Co is given as the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Each of these can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and the formation constants.

For example, [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN-]^1
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN-]^2
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN-]^3
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co^2+][SCN-]^4

So, the total [Co] is [Co^2+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, [Co^2+] is the free ion, and the other terms are the complex concentrations.

So the fraction of each complex is [complex]/c_total.

So for the complex with m SCN-, its fraction is:

([β_m [SCN]^m [Co^2+]]) / c_total.

But since [Co^2+] = c_total / (sum terms), that becomes (β_m [SCN]^m ) / (sum terms )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the sum of β_m [SCN]^m for each m, and then the fraction is β_m [SCN]^m divided by the total sum.

Yes, so:

Let's calculate S = β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Then, the fraction of the m=2 complex is (β2 [SCN]^2) / S.

So, the percentage is (β2 [SCN]^2) / S multiplied by 100.

So, let's compute each term.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term1 (m=1): β1 * [SCN]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9

Term2 (m=2): 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term3 (m=3): 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

Term4 (m=4): 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

So sum S = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = let's compute:

0.9 + 0.4 is 1.3.

1.3 + 0.063 = 1.363.

1.363 + 0.0016 = 1.3646.

So S ≈ 1.3646.

Then, the fraction for m=2 is 0.4 / 1.3646.

Let me compute that: 0.4 / 1.3646 ≈ 0.2928.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 29.28%.

Wait, but none of the options are around 29%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's confusing. So either I made a mistake in my approach or calculations.

Wait, perhaps I missed a term. Let's re-examine the problem. Oh! Wait a second, the initial Co^2+ is present, but the sum S as I computed it is only for the complexes. But the free Co^2+ is also part of the total.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

So the sum of all the Co species (free and complexes) is 1e-2 M.

But in my earlier approach, I considered the fractions as (β_m [SCN]^m ) / S, where S includes the β terms. But perhaps I should also include the free Co^2+ in the sum.

Wait, no. Because the sum S, as I computed, was the sum of β_m [SCN]^m terms. But actually, the total concentration c_total is related to [Co^2+] via:

c_total = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which can be rewritten as:

[Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + S )

Where S is the sum of the β_m [SCN]^m terms (m=1 to 4).

So S is 1.3646 as computed earlier.

So [Co^2+] = (1e-2) / (1 + 1.3646) = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.226e-3 M.

So the concentration of Co^2+ is 4.226e-3 M.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2^0. So the concentration of that is [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Which is 40 * 4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2.

Let me compute that:

40 * 4.226e-3 = 40 * ~0.004226 ≈ 0.16904.

Multiply by (0.1)^2 = 0.01: 0.16904 * 0.01 = 0.0016904 M.

But wait, the total Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the fraction is 0.0016904 / 0.01 = 0.16904, which is 16.904%. So the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but that's not matching my earlier approach. Earlier, I thought the fraction was about 29%, but that approach didn't account for the free Co^2+ correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

If [Co(SCN)_2^0] is given by β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2, then the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2^0] / c_total.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN]^2.

But [Co^2+] is c_total / (1 + S ), where S is the sum of β_m [SCN]^m.

So [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * (c_total/(1 + S )) * [SCN]^2.

So the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2^0]/c_total = (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + S )

Ah, that's an important point I missed earlier. So the fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + S )

So now, let me compute that.

Earlier, S was the sum from m=1 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m, which was 1.3646.

So 1 + S is 2.3646.

So (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / (1 + S ) = (0.4) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, that's one of the options, option D.

So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)_2^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants:  
  \[
  \beta_1 = 9, \, \beta_2 = 40, \, \beta_3 = 63, \, \beta_4 = 16
  \]

The total cobalt concentration includes all species:  
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

The fraction of cobalt in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 is given by:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the terms in the denominator
For each complex, calculate the contribution using \( \beta_m [\text{SCN}^-]^m \):  
- \( \text{Term}_1 = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \text{Term}_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 40 \times 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \text{Term}_3 = \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 63 \times 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \text{Term}_4 = \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 16 \times 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

The sum of these terms is:  
\[
S = \text{Term}_1 + \text{Term}_2 + \text{Term}_3 + \text{Term}_4 = 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of Co(SCN)_2^0
The fraction of cobalt in the form of Co(SCN)_2^0 is:  
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{1 + S} = \frac{0.4}{1 + 1.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of Co(SCN)_2^0 is:  
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
