Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit new to this. 

The question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. It goes through dehydration to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is provided, and the key difference is the presence of a cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum but not the minor's.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting materials and the reaction. Let me break it down.

The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms a cyclic anhydride. The cis-alkene would influence the structure of the anhydride. Wait, when you dehydrate a diacid, especially with a double bond, the position where the rings form is important. So, the cis alkene would lead to a specific stereochemistry in the anhydride.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region usually indicative of aromatic protons or perhaps some conjugated system. But wait, the anhydride would have carbonyl groups, maybe an oxygen nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with some symmetry. 

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). 137 is around where a double bond carbon would appear, maybe. So the anhydride has a carbonyl and another carbon that's perhaps part of a double bond or an aromatic ring.

Wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups, but in their 13C NMR, they appear as two signals. Unless the structure is symmetric. But the anhydride here has two peaks—so maybe it's a symmetric structure. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride with symmetry. For example, if the starting diacid is cis, when dehydrated, the resulting anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are across from each other in a symmetrical ring.

Wait, maybe the starting diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond? No, wait, wait. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with cis configuration. So the structure is cis-butenedioic acid.

When that dehydrates, it would form a cyclic anhydride. For cis-butenedioic acid, the dehydration would form a five-membered ring, a maleic anhydride, right? Because maleic anhydride is formed from maleic acid, which is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but in the cis configuration. So when it loses two hydroxyls (from each -COOH group), it forms an anhydride. So the structure of the anhydride would be a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Or just a ring with an oxygen bridge.

Wait, when maleic acid dehydrates, it forms maleic anhydride, which has a ring with two double bonds. The structure is a cyclic anhydride with the two double bonds: O=C-(C-O-C)-C=O. So the structure is cyclic, and the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, each part of a double bond.

So the 1H NMR of the anhydride would have protons in the 7 ppm region. Wait, maleic anhydride doesn't have protons in the aromatic region. Oh, maybe that's incorrect. Wait, the question says the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe it's not the maleic anhydride we're thinking of.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, maybe the diacid has a substituent that leads to an aromatic system when dehydrated. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the diacid has a benzene ring with substituents. For example, maybe it's something like HOOC-C6H4-COOH, but that's a benzene ring with two COOH groups. But that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is part of a larger ring, like cyclohexene diacid. When dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride with an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe the diacid isn't directly leading to an aromatic anhydride but has some conjugated system leading to a deshielded proton in the 7 ppm region. For example, an allylic position or a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So it's one type of proton. So perhaps the anhydride has a benzyl group or some symmetric structure.

Hmm, perhaps the cyclic anhydride is such that the two carbonyl groups are in a way that the ring has symmetry, so any protons are equivalent. Or maybe it's an annulene or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's just succinic acid. Wait, but it's a cis-alkene. So the diacid must have a double bond. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a diene. No, wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. So HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, that would be a diene. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with CH₂=CH₂. No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but the CH₂ groups are connected by a double bond. So HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would have a single bond, but if it's a double bond, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that can’t be right because that would be a single bond. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a cis double bond, so it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when this dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The dehydration would form a ring. So in this case, the four carbons (two from each COOH) and the two CH groups would form a ring. So, a five-membered ring: O=C-O-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, wait, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride by losing water from the two COOH groups.

Wait, for example, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. When dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a cyclic structure with two double bonds. So the structure would have a five-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups.

In the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be in the 6-7 ppm range. But wait, maleic anhydride doesn't actually have any protons on the ring because all the carbons are part of the double bonds. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The structure of maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O
   \
    C=C
   /   \
O     O

No, that's not exactly right. The structure is a cyclic anhydride with two double bonds. The protons are on the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the two central carbons, which are each attached to an oxygen and part of a double bond. So those protons would be deshielded, appearing around 6-7 ppm.

Wait, but the question states that the anhydride's 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. So perhaps it's a single set of equivalent protons. In maleic anhydride, the two protons are equivalent due to symmetry, so they would appear as a single peak. So yes, that would fit. So the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Then, the 13C NMR has two peaks. Wait, maleic anhydride has four carbons in the ring. Two carbonyls (at around 165 ppm each), two double bond carbons (maybe around 137 ppm each?), and the oxygen-bearing carbons. Wait, but the question says two peaks in 13C: 137 and 165. So that suggests that the anhydride has two types of carbons: one at 137 and the other at 165. So in maleic anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are around 175-185 ppm. But in the problem, the 13C is at 165 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the anhydride isn't maleic. Let's think again. The 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165. 165 is a carbonyl, but perhaps an ester or ketone. If it's an anhydride, the carbonyls are usually higher, around 170-220 ppm. So 165 could be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is not a five-membered ring but a six-membered ring. Let me think about another diacid. For example, a diacid derived from hexanedioic acid with a cis double bond. Wait, hexanedioic acid is HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH. If it has a cis double bond in the middle, say at positions 2 and 3, then the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would be HOOC-CH2-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, which would make it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, so maybe HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is not correct. Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between positions 2 and 3, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, but that's not possible because that would require four carbons in a row. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride. For example, if the diacid is substituted with methyl groups. But wait, the question doesn't mention any substituents, so perhaps the structure is as I first thought: a simple cis diacid dehydration leading to a symmetric anhydride.

Another approach: the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, right? So the reaction is likely a [4+2] cycloaddition, which is a Diels-Alder reaction. So the anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the cyclopentadiene is the diene.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile (the anhydride) reacts with the diene (cyclopentadiene) to form a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile and two from the diene.

So the major and minor products are the result of the Diels-Alder reaction. The major product is the endo transition state product, and the minor is the exo. Or perhaps the substituents lead to different regiochemistry, but in this case, the reaction is between a symmetric dienophile and a symmetric diene. Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which is symmetric. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me think about its structure.

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: the cyclopentadiene ring has double bonds at 1,3 positions (so it's a conjugated diene). Each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So the structure would look like a cyclopentane ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, with each of those carbons having a methyl substituent. Wait, no: positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, and each of these four carbons has a methyl group. So it's a diene with two double bonds and four methyl substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure or a cyclopentane with two double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. But with four methyl groups? So each of the 1,2,3,4 positions on the ring has a methyl substituent. So the ring is substituted with four methyl groups, which are all adjacent. So the structure would be a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups in a row on the ring.

So when this reacts with the anhydride via Diels-Alder, the two ends of the diene would attack the carbonyl groups of the anhydride. The Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

But the anhydride is symmetric, so the two possible positions for attack would produce the same product. Wait, but the diene is also symmetric in a way because of the four methyl groups. So perhaps the reaction leads to two products based on the endo rule or the way the substituents arrange.

Wait, but the products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. Let's check the molecular formulas. The starting anhydride would have the formula C4H2O3 (if it's maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3). The cyclopentadiene is C9H12. Wait, no. Let me calculate:

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: the cyclopentane ring has five carbons. Each of four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group (CH3). So the structure would be:

Positions:
1: CH2 (with a methyl)
2: CH2 (with a methyl)
3: CH2 (with a methyl)
4: CH2 (with a methyl)
5: CH2 (since cyclopentane is a five-membered ring)

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more accurately depicted as a cyclopentadiene with four substituents. Wait, maybe it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So each of those carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent, and carbon 5 is CH2.

But regardless, the formula of the diene would be C9H12: each methyl is CH3, and the diene has five ring carbons. Wait, let me count:

Each methyl is a CH3. There are four methyl groups, so 4*3=12 H from methyl groups. The cyclopentadiene has five ring carbons, each perhaps with two H, but considering the double bonds, maybe it's less. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C9H12 because the diene is C5H6 (with two double bonds, so 5*2 + 2 - 4 = 6 H?), plus four CH3 (each contributes 3 H, so 4*3=12 H). So total H would be 6 + 12 = 18? That doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is C9H12. Let's see: 1,3-cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each adds one C and three H). So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So the diene becomes C5+4=9 C, H=6+12=18. But that would be C9H18. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the diene has more H. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure correctly.

But perhaps that's a distraction. The main point is that the Diels-Alder adds the diene to the dienophile (anhydride), forming a six-membered ring with substituents.

Now, the products have the formula C13H16O3. Let's see: the anhydride is C4H2O3 (if it's maleic anhydride). The diene would be C9H12. Adding them together would give C13H14O3, but wait, the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, that suggests perhaps I'm missing two hydrogens. Maybe the diene is something else.

Wait, perhaps the diene is C9H14? Because, for example, 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups: each methyl adds a CH3, so four would add four C and 12 H. The base diene is C5H6, so the substituted diene would be C5+4=9 C, H=6 + 12=18. But that's C9H18, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups, but the actual formula is C9H12.

Wait, perhaps the diene is a conjugated diene with four methyl substituents, and the formula is C9H12. So when it reacts with the anhydride (C4H2O3), the product would be C13H14O3. But the problem states the product is C13H16O3. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the diene has more H. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride isn't maleic but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C9H12. Then the anhydride is C4H2O3. So when they react, the product would be C13H14O3, but the problem says C13H16O3. Hmm, perhaps the reaction involves adding two more H, but that doesn’t make sense because Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which doesn't add H.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is a six-membered ring anhydride. For example, hexanedioic acid's anhydride would be a six-membered ring. But that would make the anhydride C6H8O3. Then, adding the diene (C9H12) would give C15H20O3, which doesn't fit the product formula. So this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted anhydride. For instance, maybe it's a bicyclic structure or has substituents that contribute to the formula.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride, like methyl maleic anhydride, but that would change the formula. Hmm, maybe the initial assumption about the structure of the anhydride is incorrect. Let's move on to the next part.

The next part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, implying that two protons are close in space (i.e., they are diastereotopic or on adjacent atoms in a ring). The minor product lacks this. So the major product has some spatial arrangement where two protons are close, leading to a NOE effect.

In the major product's NMR, two resonances are connected: options are given. The options involve singlets and doublets at various ppm values. Let's think about what these signals could be.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the substituents from the diene. So in the major product, the substituents would be endo, leading to a more crowded structure, possibly with axial substituents in a six-membered ring.

In the product, the anhydride's oxygen would be part of an ester group, perhaps. The substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be in the ring.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. Maybe the 6H are from six equivalent methyl groups, such as three pairs of diastereotopic methyls. The doublet at 1.5 could be a proton adjacent to an oxygen.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H might be from three equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H could be adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as an ether or ester group.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So two sets of six equivalent protons, perhaps two different methyl groups. But why would a product have two separate 6H singlets?

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The doublet could be a proton near a substituent, and the 2H could be an axial or equatorial group.

The major product's NOE indicates that two protons are close. So which options have two protons that could be near each other in space?

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. If the 2H are in a position that's near the 6H methyls, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons.

Option A: 6H singlet (maybe methyl) and 1H doublet. The 1H could be adjacent to the methyl group, leading to NOE.

But the question is about which two resonances are connected in the major product. So the cross-peak links the two.

In the Diels-Alder product, the six-membered ring would have substituents from the diene and dienophile. The diene (tetramethyl cyclopentadiene) contributes four methyl groups, which would end up as four substituents on the ring. The dienophile (anhydride) contributes two carbonyl groups, which would form ester groups in the product.

Wait, but the product's formula is C13H16O3. Let's think about how that would break down. The diene is C9H12, the dienophile (anhydride) is C4H2O3. So 9+4=13 C, O is 3. H would be 12 +2 =14, but the product has 16 H. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the diene has more H.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: each methyl is CH3, and the diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure would be a conjugated diene with four methyl groups attached. So each of the four carbons in positions 1,2,3,4 is CH2CH3? No, perhaps each is CH(CH3).

Wait, let me think of the structure. The cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So each of those carbons would be CH2 (since they're in the ring with double bonds), but also have a methyl substituent. Wait, no, that's not possible because in a conjugated diene, the structure would have alternating double bonds, so each carbon is connected by double or single bonds.

Wait, maybe the structure is more accurately depicted as:

Positions 1-2: double bond
Positions 3-4: double bond
Each of positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group.

So the structure would be a conjugated diene where each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent. So each of those carbons is CH2 (if the substituent is a methyl). Then, the formula would be:

The ring has five carbons. Four of them (positions 1-4) are each CH2(CH3), and position 5 is CH2.

So each CH2(CH3) contributes 2 carbons (from the ring) plus one from the methyl. Wait, no—each substituent is a methyl group, so each CH2 is part of the ring and connected to a methyl. So each of those four carbons is CH2 connected to a methyl (so each is CH(CH3)2?), no, wait.

Actually, each of the four carbons is CH2 with a methyl substituent. Wait, no, if it's a cyclopentadiene, each of the four carbons is part of the ring, and each has a methyl substituent. So each of those carbons is CH(CH3). So the structure would have four CH(CH3) groups and one CH2 group.

So the formula would be:

Each CH(CH3) is C1, H has 2 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) = 5 H per carbon.

But wait, wait, each CH(CH3) in the ring is CH2 connected to a double bond. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the diene's formula is C9H12.

So, the dienophile (anhydride) is C4H2O3. The diene is C9H12. Adding them via Diels-Alder would eliminate two H (as the reaction is [4+2], forming a six-membered ring without adding H). So the product would have C13H14O3. But the problem states the product is C13H16O3, which suggests two more H. So perhaps the dienophile has more H or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is not an anhydride but another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile has more H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on.

The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, which suggests the reaction leads to stereoisomeric products. The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that in the major product, two protons are close in space, indicating a particular spatial arrangement, perhaps axial vs. equatorial.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the endo transition state leads to the substituents being on the same face, leading to a more crowded transition state but a more favorable product due to better orbital overlap and possible hydrogen bonding.

So the major product is the endo product, where the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents.

In the structure of the major product, the substituents (like the methyl groups from the diene) would be axial, leading to certain proton environments.

Now, looking at the options, the cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space. For example, in the endo product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen from the anhydride) would be on the same face as the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups). So if a methyl group is on one face, the oxygen substituent is on the same face, leading to certain diastereotopic protons.

So which options involve two protons that are adjacent or near each other in the structure?

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. The 6H could be three CH2 groups, each with two H. The 1H is a doublet, perhaps attached to an oxygen.

Option B: 6H singlet (maybe three methyl groups) and 2H singlet (perhaps an OCH2 group).

Option C: Two methyl groups as singlets.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet.

In the major product, the cross-peak would involve protons that are on adjacent carbons, perhaps in a chair-like structure, or on the same face of a ring.

If the product is a bicyclic structure, perhaps the substituents are close. Alternatively, the six-membered ring could have protons that are axial and equatorial.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the dienophile are typically on the endo face. So any substituents from the dienophile would be on the same face as the substituents from the diene.

So in the product, the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face as the oxygen substituents from the dienophile. So perhaps one of the protons is on a substituent near the oxygen, leading to a proximity in space.

So the 1H NMR would show peaks for these substituents. For example, the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm could be three methyl groups (each with two H, but in a singlet due to symmetry). The 1H doublet at ~1.5 could be a proton that's adjacent to an oxygen or near a substituent.

But why would there be a cross-peak between a methyl group and a doublet proton? Because the methyl's protons are all equivalent, but the doublet implies it's split by a neighboring proton. So perhaps the methyl and the doublet proton are on adjacent carbons, leading to NOE.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between two protons that are close in space, like in a chair conformation. For example, axial and equatorial protons.

Wait, but the options involve different types of peaks. Let's think about the endo product. In the endo transition state, the substituents are on the same face. So in the product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen) would be on the same side as the substituents from the diene (methyl groups).

If the product is a six-membered ring with substituents, the axial positions would have substituents pointing inwards, and the equatorial substituents would be pointing outwards. So in the endo product, the substituents would be axial.

So, consider the substituents on the ring. Suppose the dienophile contributes two ester groups (from the anhydride) in the endo positions. The diene contributes four methyl groups, also in the endo positions.

So in the product, the substituents (like methyl and oxygen groups) are on the same face. So any protons on adjacent substituents would be close, leading to a NOE effect in the NOESY spectrum.

Looking at the options, option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 6H could be three methyl groups (each CH3, so 3 * 2 H = 6 H). The 2H singlet could be an OCH2 group.

If the 2H are part of an oxygen-bearing group (like an ester), they might be in a position where they're near the methyl groups. For instance, if the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, the protons on OCH2 would be near the methyl protons, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Alternatively, option A suggests a 6H singlet at 1 ppm (probably methyl) and a 1H doublet. If the 1H is near the methyl group, they could be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But the problem says that the cross-peak is present in the major product but not the minor. So the major product has substituents in a specific arrangement that brings those two sets of protons close.

In the endo product, the substituents are on the same face, which would bring the methyl groups and any oxygenated protons near each other in space, leading to a NOE effect.

So, considering the options, option B's 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an OCH2 group, and the 6H singlet at 1.7 could be three methyl groups. If the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option A's 6H could be methyl groups, and the 1H doublet could be a proton that's adjacent, like on a double bond or next to an oxygen. But why would a doublet appear here?

Wait, the dienophile is an anhydride, which upon reaction forms two ester groups. So in the product, there are ester groups. The ester groups would have CH2-O-CO structures. 

In the product, the substituents would be the ester groups and the methyl groups from the diene. So perhaps the ester groups would have protons near the methyl groups, leading to NOE.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycloadduct has an endo transition state where the substituents are on the same face, leading to a situation where a methyl group is near an oxygen-bearing group.

So, looking again at the options:

Option B: 6H singlet (maybe three methyl groups) and 2H singlet (OCH2). If the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, their protons would be in proximity. So the 6H and 2H would have a cross-peak.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet. Maybe a proton that's near the 2H group, but why would that be present only in the major product.

Alternatively, in the endo product, the substituents are arranged such that axial and equatorial protons are close, whereas in the exo product, they are not. 

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the 6H singlet in options A and C suggests that the protons are equivalent, perhaps from a symmetric arrangement like three methyl groups attached to equivalent positions on the ring. The 2H singlet in option B would indicate two equivalent protons, perhaps from an OCH2 group.

The cross-peak in the NOESY connects a methyl group and another proton group. So, if in the major product, these two groups are close, but in the minor product, they are not.

Putting it all together, I think the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH2). So the correct answer would be option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a Diels-Alder reaction between a symmetric anhydride (likely maleic anhydride, based on the NMR data) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The reaction produces two products: a major product (endo) and a minor product (exo). The major product has a cross-peak in its NOESY spectrum, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons, while the minor product lacks this feature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**:  
   The anhydride is symmetric, as indicated by its 1H NMR (single peak at 7 ppm) and 13C NMR (two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm). This suggests it is likely maleic anhydride, which has a five-membered cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups.

2. **Diene Structure**:  
   The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is a conjugated diene with four methyl substituents on the cyclopentane ring. Its molecular formula is C9H12.

3. **Reaction and Products**:  
   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents from both the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene. The major product follows the endo rule, where substituents are on the same face of the ring, leading to spatial proximity between certain protons. The minor product follows the exo rule, where substituents are on opposite faces.

4. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum indicates that two protons are spatially close. This is due to the endo arrangement of substituents, where methyl groups from the diene are near oxygen-bearing groups from the anhydride.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and a 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm). The 6H singlet likely corresponds to methyl groups, but the 1H doublet does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm). The 6H singlet corresponds to methyl groups, and the 2H singlet likely corresponds to an OCH2 group. These two sets of protons are spatially close in the endo product due to the proximity of methyl groups and oxygen-bearing groups.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets (~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm). This does not match the expected NMR data, as there is no indication of two distinct 6H singlets in the product.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm). The 1H doublet does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH2 group). This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit new to this. 

The question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. It goes through dehydration to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is provided, and the key difference is the presence of a cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum but not the minor's.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting materials and the reaction. Let me break it down.

The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms a cyclic anhydride. The cis-alkene would influence the structure of the anhydride. Wait, when you dehydrate a diacid, especially with a double bond, the position where the rings form is important. So, the cis alkene would lead to a specific stereochemistry in the anhydride.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region usually indicative of aromatic protons or perhaps some conjugated system. But wait, the anhydride would have carbonyl groups, maybe an oxygen nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with some symmetry. 

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 165 is likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). 137 is around where a double bond carbon would appear, maybe. So the anhydride has a carbonyl and another carbon that's perhaps part of a double bond or an aromatic ring.

Wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups, but in their 13C NMR, they appear as two signals. Unless the structure is symmetric. But the anhydride here has two peaks—so maybe it's a symmetric structure. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride with symmetry. For example, if the starting diacid is cis, when dehydrated, the resulting anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are across from each other in a symmetrical ring.

Wait, maybe the starting diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond? No, wait, wait. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with cis configuration. So the structure is cis-butenedioic acid.

When that dehydrates, it would form a cyclic anhydride. For cis-butenedioic acid, the dehydration would form a five-membered ring, a maleic anhydride, right? Because maleic anhydride is formed from maleic acid, which is the cis isomer of 1,2-dihydroxyethylene. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, but in the cis configuration. So when it loses two hydroxyls (from each -COOH group), it forms an anhydride. So the structure of the anhydride would be a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Or just a ring with an oxygen bridge.

Wait, when maleic acid dehydrates, it forms maleic anhydride, which has a ring with two double bonds. The structure is a cyclic anhydride with the two double bonds: O=C-(C-O-C)-C=O. So the structure is cyclic, and the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, each part of a double bond.

So the 1H NMR of the anhydride would have protons in the 7 ppm region. Wait, maleic anhydride doesn't have protons in the aromatic region. Oh, maybe that's incorrect. Wait, the question says the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe it's not the maleic anhydride we're thinking of.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, maybe the diacid has a substituent that leads to an aromatic system when dehydrated. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the diacid has a benzene ring with substituents. For example, maybe it's something like HOOC-C6H4-COOH, but that's a benzene ring with two COOH groups. But that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is part of a larger ring, like cyclohexene diacid. When dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride with an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe the diacid isn't directly leading to an aromatic anhydride but has some conjugated system leading to a deshielded proton in the 7 ppm region. For example, an allylic position or a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So it's one type of proton. So perhaps the anhydride has a benzyl group or some symmetric structure.

Hmm, perhaps the cyclic anhydride is such that the two carbonyl groups are in a way that the ring has symmetry, so any protons are equivalent. Or maybe it's an annulene or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's just succinic acid. Wait, but it's a cis-alkene. So the diacid must have a double bond. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a diene. No, wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the middle. So HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, that would be a diene. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with CH₂=CH₂. No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but the CH₂ groups are connected by a double bond. So HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH would have a single bond, but if it's a double bond, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that can’t be right because that would be a single bond. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a cis double bond, so it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when this dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The dehydration would form a ring. So in this case, the four carbons (two from each COOH) and the two CH groups would form a ring. So, a five-membered ring: O=C-O-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, wait, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride by losing water from the two COOH groups.

Wait, for example, maleic acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂H. When dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a cyclic structure with two double bonds. So the structure would have a five-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups.

In the 1H NMR of maleic anhydride, the protons adjacent to the double bond would be in the 6-7 ppm range. But wait, maleic anhydride doesn't actually have any protons on the ring because all the carbons are part of the double bonds. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The structure of maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O
   \
    C=C
   /   \
O     O

No, that's not exactly right. The structure is a cyclic anhydride with two double bonds. The protons are on the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the two central carbons, which are each attached to an oxygen and part of a double bond. So those protons would be deshielded, appearing around 6-7 ppm.

Wait, but the question states that the anhydride's 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. So perhaps it's a single set of equivalent protons. In maleic anhydride, the two protons are equivalent due to symmetry, so they would appear as a single peak. So yes, that would fit. So the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Then, the 13C NMR has two peaks. Wait, maleic anhydride has four carbons in the ring. Two carbonyls (at around 165 ppm each), two double bond carbons (maybe around 137 ppm each?), and the oxygen-bearing carbons. Wait, but the question says two peaks in 13C: 137 and 165. So that suggests that the anhydride has two types of carbons: one at 137 and the other at 165. So in maleic anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are around 175-185 ppm. But in the problem, the 13C is at 165 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the anhydride isn't maleic. Let's think again. The 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165. 165 is a carbonyl, but perhaps an ester or ketone. If it's an anhydride, the carbonyls are usually higher, around 170-220 ppm. So 165 could be a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is not a five-membered ring but a six-membered ring. Let me think about another diacid. For example, a diacid derived from hexanedioic acid with a cis double bond. Wait, hexanedioic acid is HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH. If it has a cis double bond in the middle, say at positions 2 and 3, then the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would be HOOC-CH2-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, which would make it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, so maybe HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is not correct. Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between positions 2 and 3, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond, but that's not possible because that would require four carbons in a row. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride. For example, if the diacid is substituted with methyl groups. But wait, the question doesn't mention any substituents, so perhaps the structure is as I first thought: a simple cis diacid dehydration leading to a symmetric anhydride.

Another approach: the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, right? So the reaction is likely a [4+2] cycloaddition, which is a Diels-Alder reaction. So the anhydride acts as the dienophile, and the cyclopentadiene is the diene.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile (the anhydride) reacts with the diene (cyclopentadiene) to form a six-membered ring with two substituents from the dienophile and two from the diene.

So the major and minor products are the result of the Diels-Alder reaction. The major product is the endo transition state product, and the minor is the exo. Or perhaps the substituents lead to different regiochemistry, but in this case, the reaction is between a symmetric dienophile and a symmetric diene. Wait, the dienophile is the anhydride, which is symmetric. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me think about its structure.

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: the cyclopentadiene ring has double bonds at 1,3 positions (so it's a conjugated diene). Each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So the structure would look like a cyclopentane ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, with each of those carbons having a methyl substituent. Wait, no: positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, and each of these four carbons has a methyl group. So it's a diene with two double bonds and four methyl substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure or a cyclopentane with two double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. But with four methyl groups? So each of the 1,2,3,4 positions on the ring has a methyl substituent. So the ring is substituted with four methyl groups, which are all adjacent. So the structure would be a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups in a row on the ring.

So when this reacts with the anhydride via Diels-Alder, the two ends of the diene would attack the carbonyl groups of the anhydride. The Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring with substituents from both reactants.

But the anhydride is symmetric, so the two possible positions for attack would produce the same product. Wait, but the diene is also symmetric in a way because of the four methyl groups. So perhaps the reaction leads to two products based on the endo rule or the way the substituents arrange.

Wait, but the products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. Let's check the molecular formulas. The starting anhydride would have the formula C4H2O3 (if it's maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3). The cyclopentadiene is C9H12. Wait, no. Let me calculate:

1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: the cyclopentane ring has five carbons. Each of four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group (CH3). So the structure would be:

Positions:
1: CH2 (with a methyl)
2: CH2 (with a methyl)
3: CH2 (with a methyl)
4: CH2 (with a methyl)
5: CH2 (since cyclopentane is a five-membered ring)

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more accurately depicted as a cyclopentadiene with four substituents. Wait, maybe it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3,4. So each of those carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent, and carbon 5 is CH2.

But regardless, the formula of the diene would be C9H12: each methyl is CH3, and the diene has five ring carbons. Wait, let me count:

Each methyl is a CH3. There are four methyl groups, so 4*3=12 H from methyl groups. The cyclopentadiene has five ring carbons, each perhaps with two H, but considering the double bonds, maybe it's less. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C9H12 because the diene is C5H6 (with two double bonds, so 5*2 + 2 - 4 = 6 H?), plus four CH3 (each contributes 3 H, so 4*3=12 H). So total H would be 6 + 12 = 18? That doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is C9H12. Let's see: 1,3-cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each adds one C and three H). So four methyl groups add 4 C and 12 H. So the diene becomes C5+4=9 C, H=6+12=18. But that would be C9H18. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the diene has more H. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the structure correctly.

But perhaps that's a distraction. The main point is that the Diels-Alder adds the diene to the dienophile (anhydride), forming a six-membered ring with substituents.

Now, the products have the formula C13H16O3. Let's see: the anhydride is C4H2O3 (if it's maleic anhydride). The diene would be C9H12. Adding them together would give C13H14O3, but wait, the product is C13H16O3. Hmm, that suggests perhaps I'm missing two hydrogens. Maybe the diene is something else.

Wait, perhaps the diene is C9H14? Because, for example, 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups: each methyl adds a CH3, so four would add four C and 12 H. The base diene is C5H6, so the substituted diene would be C5+4=9 C, H=6 + 12=18. But that's C9H18, which doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups, but the actual formula is C9H12.

Wait, perhaps the diene is a conjugated diene with four methyl substituents, and the formula is C9H12. So when it reacts with the anhydride (C4H2O3), the product would be C13H14O3. But the problem states the product is C13H16O3. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the diene has more H. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride isn't maleic but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C9H12. Then the anhydride is C4H2O3. So when they react, the product would be C13H14O3, but the problem says C13H16O3. Hmm, perhaps the reaction involves adding two more H, but that doesn’t make sense because Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which doesn't add H.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is a six-membered ring anhydride. For example, hexanedioic acid's anhydride would be a six-membered ring. But that would make the anhydride C6H8O3. Then, adding the diene (C9H12) would give C15H20O3, which doesn't fit the product formula. So this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is a substituted anhydride. For instance, maybe it's a bicyclic structure or has substituents that contribute to the formula.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a substituted maleic anhydride, like methyl maleic anhydride, but that would change the formula. Hmm, maybe the initial assumption about the structure of the anhydride is incorrect. Let's move on to the next part.

The next part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, implying that two protons are close in space (i.e., they are diastereotopic or on adjacent atoms in a ring). The minor product lacks this. So the major product has some spatial arrangement where two protons are close, leading to a NOE effect.

In the major product's NMR, two resonances are connected: options are given. The options involve singlets and doublets at various ppm values. Let's think about what these signals could be.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the substituents from the diene. So in the major product, the substituents would be endo, leading to a more crowded structure, possibly with axial substituents in a six-membered ring.

In the product, the anhydride's oxygen would be part of an ester group, perhaps. The substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be in the ring.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. Maybe the 6H are from six equivalent methyl groups, such as three pairs of diastereotopic methyls. The doublet at 1.5 could be a proton adjacent to an oxygen.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H might be from three equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H could be adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as an ether or ester group.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So two sets of six equivalent protons, perhaps two different methyl groups. But why would a product have two separate 6H singlets?

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The doublet could be a proton near a substituent, and the 2H could be an axial or equatorial group.

The major product's NOE indicates that two protons are close. So which options have two protons that could be near each other in space?

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. If the 2H are in a position that's near the 6H methyls, perhaps they're on adjacent carbons.

Option A: 6H singlet (maybe methyl) and 1H doublet. The 1H could be adjacent to the methyl group, leading to NOE.

But the question is about which two resonances are connected in the major product. So the cross-peak links the two.

In the Diels-Alder product, the six-membered ring would have substituents from the diene and dienophile. The diene (tetramethyl cyclopentadiene) contributes four methyl groups, which would end up as four substituents on the ring. The dienophile (anhydride) contributes two carbonyl groups, which would form ester groups in the product.

Wait, but the product's formula is C13H16O3. Let's think about how that would break down. The diene is C9H12, the dienophile (anhydride) is C4H2O3. So 9+4=13 C, O is 3. H would be 12 +2 =14, but the product has 16 H. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the diene has more H.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: each methyl is CH3, and the diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure would be a conjugated diene with four methyl groups attached. So each of the four carbons in positions 1,2,3,4 is CH2CH3? No, perhaps each is CH(CH3).

Wait, let me think of the structure. The cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So each of those carbons would be CH2 (since they're in the ring with double bonds), but also have a methyl substituent. Wait, no, that's not possible because in a conjugated diene, the structure would have alternating double bonds, so each carbon is connected by double or single bonds.

Wait, maybe the structure is more accurately depicted as:

Positions 1-2: double bond
Positions 3-4: double bond
Each of positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group.

So the structure would be a conjugated diene where each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl substituent. So each of those carbons is CH2 (if the substituent is a methyl). Then, the formula would be:

The ring has five carbons. Four of them (positions 1-4) are each CH2(CH3), and position 5 is CH2.

So each CH2(CH3) contributes 2 carbons (from the ring) plus one from the methyl. Wait, no—each substituent is a methyl group, so each CH2 is part of the ring and connected to a methyl. So each of those four carbons is CH2 connected to a methyl (so each is CH(CH3)2?), no, wait.

Actually, each of the four carbons is CH2 with a methyl substituent. Wait, no, if it's a cyclopentadiene, each of the four carbons is part of the ring, and each has a methyl substituent. So each of those carbons is CH(CH3). So the structure would have four CH(CH3) groups and one CH2 group.

So the formula would be:

Each CH(CH3) is C1, H has 2 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) = 5 H per carbon.

But wait, wait, each CH(CH3) in the ring is CH2 connected to a double bond. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the diene's formula is C9H12.

So, the dienophile (anhydride) is C4H2O3. The diene is C9H12. Adding them via Diels-Alder would eliminate two H (as the reaction is [4+2], forming a six-membered ring without adding H). So the product would have C13H14O3. But the problem states the product is C13H16O3, which suggests two more H. So perhaps the dienophile has more H or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the dienophile is not an anhydride but another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile has more H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on.

The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, which suggests the reaction leads to stereoisomeric products. The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that in the major product, two protons are close in space, indicating a particular spatial arrangement, perhaps axial vs. equatorial.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the endo transition state leads to the substituents being on the same face, leading to a more crowded transition state but a more favorable product due to better orbital overlap and possible hydrogen bonding.

So the major product is the endo product, where the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents.

In the structure of the major product, the substituents (like the methyl groups from the diene) would be axial, leading to certain proton environments.

Now, looking at the options, the cross-peak connects two protons that are close in space. For example, in the endo product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen from the anhydride) would be on the same face as the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups). So if a methyl group is on one face, the oxygen substituent is on the same face, leading to certain diastereotopic protons.

So which options involve two protons that are adjacent or near each other in the structure?

Option A: 6H singlet and 1H doublet. The 6H could be three CH2 groups, each with two H. The 1H is a doublet, perhaps attached to an oxygen.

Option B: 6H singlet (maybe three methyl groups) and 2H singlet (perhaps an OCH2 group).

Option C: Two methyl groups as singlets.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet.

In the major product, the cross-peak would involve protons that are on adjacent carbons, perhaps in a chair-like structure, or on the same face of a ring.

If the product is a bicyclic structure, perhaps the substituents are close. Alternatively, the six-membered ring could have protons that are axial and equatorial.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the dienophile are typically on the endo face. So any substituents from the dienophile would be on the same face as the substituents from the diene.

So in the product, the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face as the oxygen substituents from the dienophile. So perhaps one of the protons is on a substituent near the oxygen, leading to a proximity in space.

So the 1H NMR would show peaks for these substituents. For example, the 6H singlet at ~1 ppm could be three methyl groups (each with two H, but in a singlet due to symmetry). The 1H doublet at ~1.5 could be a proton that's adjacent to an oxygen or near a substituent.

But why would there be a cross-peak between a methyl group and a doublet proton? Because the methyl's protons are all equivalent, but the doublet implies it's split by a neighboring proton. So perhaps the methyl and the doublet proton are on adjacent carbons, leading to NOE.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between two protons that are close in space, like in a chair conformation. For example, axial and equatorial protons.

Wait, but the options involve different types of peaks. Let's think about the endo product. In the endo transition state, the substituents are on the same face. So in the product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the oxygen) would be on the same side as the substituents from the diene (methyl groups).

If the product is a six-membered ring with substituents, the axial positions would have substituents pointing inwards, and the equatorial substituents would be pointing outwards. So in the endo product, the substituents would be axial.

So, consider the substituents on the ring. Suppose the dienophile contributes two ester groups (from the anhydride) in the endo positions. The diene contributes four methyl groups, also in the endo positions.

So in the product, the substituents (like methyl and oxygen groups) are on the same face. So any protons on adjacent substituents would be close, leading to a NOE effect in the NOESY spectrum.

Looking at the options, option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 6H could be three methyl groups (each CH3, so 3 * 2 H = 6 H). The 2H singlet could be an OCH2 group.

If the 2H are part of an oxygen-bearing group (like an ester), they might be in a position where they're near the methyl groups. For instance, if the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, the protons on OCH2 would be near the methyl protons, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Alternatively, option A suggests a 6H singlet at 1 ppm (probably methyl) and a 1H doublet. If the 1H is near the methyl group, they could be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But the problem says that the cross-peak is present in the major product but not the minor. So the major product has substituents in a specific arrangement that brings those two sets of protons close.

In the endo product, the substituents are on the same face, which would bring the methyl groups and any oxygenated protons near each other in space, leading to a NOE effect.

So, considering the options, option B's 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an OCH2 group, and the 6H singlet at 1.7 could be three methyl groups. If the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option A's 6H could be methyl groups, and the 1H doublet could be a proton that's adjacent, like on a double bond or next to an oxygen. But why would a doublet appear here?

Wait, the dienophile is an anhydride, which upon reaction forms two ester groups. So in the product, there are ester groups. The ester groups would have CH2-O-CO structures. 

In the product, the substituents would be the ester groups and the methyl groups from the diene. So perhaps the ester groups would have protons near the methyl groups, leading to NOE.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycloadduct has an endo transition state where the substituents are on the same face, leading to a situation where a methyl group is near an oxygen-bearing group.

So, looking again at the options:

Option B: 6H singlet (maybe three methyl groups) and 2H singlet (OCH2). If the OCH2 is adjacent to a methyl group, their protons would be in proximity. So the 6H and 2H would have a cross-peak.

Option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet. Maybe a proton that's near the 2H group, but why would that be present only in the major product.

Alternatively, in the endo product, the substituents are arranged such that axial and equatorial protons are close, whereas in the exo product, they are not. 

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the 6H singlet in options A and C suggests that the protons are equivalent, perhaps from a symmetric arrangement like three methyl groups attached to equivalent positions on the ring. The 2H singlet in option B would indicate two equivalent protons, perhaps from an OCH2 group.

The cross-peak in the NOESY connects a methyl group and another proton group. So, if in the major product, these two groups are close, but in the minor product, they are not.

Putting it all together, I think the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH2). So the correct answer would be option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.


The problem involves a Diels-Alder reaction between a symmetric anhydride (likely maleic anhydride, based on the NMR data) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The reaction produces two products: a major product (endo) and a minor product (exo). The major product has a cross-peak in its NOESY spectrum, indicating spatial proximity between two sets of protons, while the minor product lacks this feature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**:  
   The anhydride is symmetric, as indicated by its 1H NMR (single peak at 7 ppm) and 13C NMR (two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm). This suggests it is likely maleic anhydride, which has a five-membered cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups.

2. **Diene Structure**:  
   The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is a conjugated diene with four methyl substituents on the cyclopentane ring. Its molecular formula is C9H12.

3. **Reaction and Products**:  
   The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents from both the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene. The major product follows the endo rule, where substituents are on the same face of the ring, leading to spatial proximity between certain protons. The minor product follows the exo rule, where substituents are on opposite faces.

4. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum indicates that two protons are spatially close. This is due to the endo arrangement of substituents, where methyl groups from the diene are near oxygen-bearing groups from the anhydride.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet (~1 ppm) and a 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm). The 6H singlet likely corresponds to methyl groups, but the 1H doublet does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet (~1.7 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm). The 6H singlet corresponds to methyl groups, and the 2H singlet likely corresponds to an OCH2 group. These two sets of protons are spatially close in the endo product due to the proximity of methyl groups and oxygen-bearing groups.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets (~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm). This does not match the expected NMR data, as there is no indication of two distinct 6H singlets in the product.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet (~1.5 ppm) and a 2H singlet (~3.5 ppm). The 1H doublet does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of protons in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH2 group). This corresponds to **Option B**.
