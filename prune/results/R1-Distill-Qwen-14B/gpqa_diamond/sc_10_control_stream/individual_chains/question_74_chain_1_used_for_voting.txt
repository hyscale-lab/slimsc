Okay, so I have this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are given as A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The formula I think is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, in terms of probability, maybe it's better to think in terms of the survival probability.

Oh right, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is P(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Wait, but the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed on average. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Let me write that down.

So, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. Which means e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural log on both sides, -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/(100). Let me calculate that.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative because 0.68 is less than 1. So -ln(0.68) is positive. Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.38566 (I might need to be precise here, but maybe I can approximate or remember that ln(0.68)= -0.38566). So λ = 0.38566 / 100. So λ is about 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can find λ another way. Let me see, perhaps using the formula for half-life? Because sometimes people remember half-life better.

The half-life T1/2 is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. The relation between λ and T1/2 is λ = ln(2)/T1/2. But wait, in this problem, we don't know the half-life; we know the decay probability in 100 minutes. So it's easier to work with the given 100-minute data.

So back to the main problem. We have 50 minutes passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the question is, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So that would be from t=50 to t=50+150=200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, "the next 150 minutes" after the 50 minutes. So we are considering a period of 150 minutes starting at t=50. So the question is, what's the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

But wait, in radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a given interval is independent of the time passed before. So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is the same as the probability it decays in any interval of 150 minutes, regardless of when.

Wait, that's the key. Radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval depends only on the length of the interval, not on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability for the next 150.

So regardless of the past, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as 1 - P(150), where P(150) is the probability it hasn't decayed after 150 minutes.

Wait no, wait. Because the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So perhaps to find the probability for 150 minutes, we can use the decay constant λ that we found.

Wait, let me get this straight. The 32% decay in 100 minutes gives us the decay constant. Then the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

So let's compute that.

First, find λ. As I said,

1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ*100) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 → ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the probability that the atom decays in 150 minutes is:

P_decay = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)

Plugging in λ:

P_decay = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)

Calculate 0.0038566 * 150: 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

Hmm, e^(-0.57849). Let's think.

I know that ln(2) is about 0.693, so e^(-0.693)=0.5. So 0.57849 is a bit less than 0.693. So e^-0.57849 is a bit more than 0.5.

Compute 0.57849 is about 0.578. So e^-0.578 ≈ ?

Using calculator in mind: Let me think, e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065. e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. So 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

So let me compute 0.578 as an exponent. Let me approximate.

Let me think, 0.5: 0.6065

0.578 is 0.078 above 0.5. Let me compute the derivative of e^-x at x=0.5. The derivative is -e^-x. At x=0.5, it's about -0.6065.

So an increase of dx=0.078 in x would lead to a change in e^-x of approximately -0.6065 * 0.078 ≈ -0.0473. So e^-0.578 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0473 ≈ 0.5592.

Wait, but wait, actually, the function is e^-x, so when x increases, e^-x decreases. So e^-0.578 is less than e^-0.5. Wait, wait, no. Because 0.578 is larger than 0.5, so e^-0.578 is smaller than e^-0.5. So 0.578 is 0.078 more than 0.5. So the value is 0.6065 minus (approx) (0.6065 * 0.078) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0473 → 0.5592.

So e^-0.578 ≈ ~0.559. So 1 - 0.559 = 0.441 → about 44.1% chance of decay in the next 150 minutes.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be the closest. But wait, I think I made an approximation in calculating e^-0.578. Let me check if there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the value more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation that λ* t = 0.57849.

So more accurately, let me compute e^-0.57849.

I can use the fact that e^0.57849 is approximately:

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872.

e^0.6 = 1.82211.

0.57849 is 0.07849 above 0.5. Let me compute the value.

So let me compute e^0.57849.

The difference between 0.57849 and 0.5 is 0.07849.

Use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

Let me let f(x) = e^x. Then f'(x) = e^x.

At x=0.5, f'(0.5) = e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

So f(0.5 + dx) ≈ f(0.5) + f'(0.5)*dx.

dx = 0.07849.

So f(0.57849) ≈ 1.64872 + 1.64872 * 0.07849.

Compute 1.64872 * 0.07849.

Let me approximate 1.64872 * 0.07 ≈ 0.11541.

1.64872 * 0.00849 ≈ approx 0.014 (since 1.64872 * 0.008 = 0.01319, and 1.64872 * 0.00049 ≈ 0.000808). So total is about 0.013998.

So total ≈ 0.11541 + 0.013998 ≈ 0.1294.

So f(0.57849) ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1294 ≈ 1.77812.

So e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.77812, so e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.77812 ≈ 0.5618.

Wait, 1.778 is approximately 1.778. 1/1.778 ≈ 0.5618.

Wait, 1.778 is about 1.778. Let me compute 1 divided by 1.778.

1 / 1.778 ≈ 0.5618.

So 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382 → approximately 43.82% chance.

So that's about 43.8%, which is approximately 44%. So the answer would be option A) 44%.

Wait, but the options include option D) 48% and others. Hmm, or did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the initial information. Now, we have passed 50 minutes without decay. We need the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, another way to approach this is to find the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. So the total time is 200 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 200). But wait, because the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay, does that affect the calculation? Or is it just the same as the probability of decay in 200 minutes?

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes starting at t=50 is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when it starts. So perhaps the initial 50 minutes don't change the probability for the next 150. So the probability is still the same as the 150-minute decay probability.

Wait, but wait, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So maybe I should calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, but I already have λ from the 100-minute data.

Wait, so the process is:

1. Calculate λ using the 100-minute data.

λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

2. Then, compute the probability that the atom decays in 150 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

As I calculated earlier, that's approximately 44%.

But let me think again: is it the same as the 100-minute case? Because the decay is memoryless, if I have already waited 50 minutes, does that change anything?

Wait, no. Because the probability of decay in any interval depends only on the length of the interval, not on when it starts. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the next 150 minutes. So the probability is determined solely by the 150 minutes, using the same λ.

So the correct approach is to calculate 1 - e^(-λ * 150) with λ from the given 100-minute data.

Which gives us around 44%, so option A.

But wait, wait, the options don't have 44% as the correct answer, perhaps. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)44%

B)40%

C)52%

D)48%

Hmm, my calculation gives around 44%, so A is the option.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of lambda. Let me double-check the calculation of lambda.

Given that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ*100)=0.68.

So taking natural logs:

-λ * 100 = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, but 0.68 is smaller than 0.7, so ln(0.68) is more negative.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.68) accurately. Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll use some approximations.

We know that ln(2/3) ≈ ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

Wait, 0.68 is a bit higher than 2/3 (≈0.6667), so ln(0.68) is less negative than ln(2/3). Let me use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, using the Taylor series expansion for ln(x) around x=1.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.32^2)/2 - (0.32^3)/3 - ... .

Wait, that might be more accurate.

So ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.1024)/2 - (0.032768)/3 - (0.01048576)/4 - ...

Calculating each term:

-0.32

-0.1024/2 = -0.0512 → total so far: -0.3712

-0.032768/3 ≈ -0.01092 → total: -0.38212

-0.01048576/4 ≈ -0.00262144 → total: -0.38474.

Next term: (0.0033554432)/5 → 0.0006710886. But wait, the expansion is ln(1 - x) = -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - x^4/4 - ..., so the next term is +x^4/(4*1), but wait, no: it's actually x is 0.32, so:

Wait, ln(1 - x) = -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - x⁴/4 - ... for x < 1.

So each term is negative, so the expansion is:

ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) = -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4 - ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: -0.32

Second term: -(0.32)^2 / 2 = -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 → sum: -0.3712

Third term: -(0.32)^3/3 = -(0.032768)/3 ≈ -0.0109227 → sum: -0.38212

Fourth term: -(0.32)^4/4 = -(0.01048576)/4 ≈ -0.00262144 → sum: -0.3847414

Fifth term: -(0.32)^5/5 = -(0.0033554432)/5 ≈ -0.0006710886 → sum: -0.38541249

Wait, but 0.32^5 is 0.32^4 * 0.32 → 0.01048576 * 0.32 = 0.0033554432.

So fifth term is about -0.000671.

Adding that to the sum gives about -0.38541249.

But how accurate is this? Let's say it's about -0.38566, which is approximately what I thought earlier.

So lambda is ln(0.68) = -0.38566. So λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, moving on to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

So e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-0.0038566 * 150) = e^(-0.57849).

As I calculated earlier, e^(-0.57849) is approximately 0.559, so 1 - 0.559 = 0.441 → 44.1% chance.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe the options round differently.

Wait, perhaps I should find the exact value. Let's compute 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849.

I can compute this using the fact that e^0.57849 is approximately 1.7818. Because e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.57849 is a bit higher.

Wait, another approach: the natural logarithm of 1.7818 is approximately 0.57849.

Let me check: ln(1.78) is about 0.576. Because e^0.576 ≈ 1.778.

Hmm, that's close. So e^0.576 ≈ 1.778. So e^0.57849 would be a bit higher, maybe around 1.781.

Thus, e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.5612.

Thus, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388 → 43.88%≈44%.

So the answer should be option A)44%.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes people get confused between the probability over a certain time and the conditional probability.

Wait, an alternative approach would be to consider that the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay, so the remaining lifetime is being considered.

But no, the decay is memoryless, so the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as for any 150-minute interval, regardless of previous time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to think in terms of conditional probability. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but that would be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, because the decay process is memoryless. So the conditional probability is just the probability of decaying in that 150-minute interval.

Wait, conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B).

In this case, A is the event that it decays in the next 150 minutes (t=50 to t=200), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed by t=50.

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But P(A and B) is the probability that it has not decayed by t=50, and then decays between t=50 and t=200.

Which is [e^(-λ*50)] * [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

P(B) is e^(-λ *50).

So P(A|B) = [e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ*150)))] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the prior 50 minutes.

So that's consistent with the earlier approach. So the answer is approximately 44%, so option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 48%. Could I have made a calculation error?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute e^-0.57849 more accurately.

Let me think, I can compute e^-0.57849 by considering that 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.

We know that e^-0.5 = 0.6065.

Now, e^-(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849.

We can compute e^-0.07849 using the Taylor series.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6, where x is small.

x = -0.07849.

So e^-0.07849 ≈ 1 + (-0.07849) + (0.07849^2)/2 + (- (0.07849)^3)/6.

Calculate each term:

1 =1.

-0.07849 → + (-0.07849) → 0.92151.

(0.07849^2)/2: 0.07849^2 = 0.006161. Divided by 2: 0.0030805.

Next term: -(0.07849)^3 /6 → 0.07849^3 = 0.07849 * 0.07849 *0.07849 ≈ 0.000482. Divided by 6: ≈ 0.0000803. So negative: -0.0000803.

Adding all up:

1 → 1

-0.07849 → 0.92151

+0.0030805 → 0.9245905

-0.0000803 → 0.9245102.

So e^-0.07849 ≈ approximately 0.92451.

So e^-0.57849 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92451 ≈ let's compute that.

0.6 * 0.92451 = 0.554706.

0.0065 * 0.92451 ≈ 0.0060093.

So total is approximately 0.554706 + 0.0060093 = 0.560715.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5607.

Thus, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 → 43.93% ≈ 44%.

So the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using approximations, \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), so:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the decay formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5607 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
P(150) \approx 43.93\% \, \text{(approximately 44\%)}.
\]

Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.

From the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I have this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are given as A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The formula I think is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, in terms of probability, maybe it's better to think in terms of the survival probability.

Oh right, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is P(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Wait, but the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed on average. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. Let me write that down.

So, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. Which means e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68. Taking the natural log on both sides, -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/(100). Let me calculate that.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative because 0.68 is less than 1. So -ln(0.68) is positive. Let me compute ln(0.68). Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.38566 (I might need to be precise here, but maybe I can approximate or remember that ln(0.68)= -0.38566). So λ = 0.38566 / 100. So λ is about 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can find λ another way. Let me see, perhaps using the formula for half-life? Because sometimes people remember half-life better.

The half-life T1/2 is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. The relation between λ and T1/2 is λ = ln(2)/T1/2. But wait, in this problem, we don't know the half-life; we know the decay probability in 100 minutes. So it's easier to work with the given 100-minute data.

So back to the main problem. We have 50 minutes passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the question is, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. So that would be from t=50 to t=50+150=200 minutes. So the total time is 200 minutes.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, "the next 150 minutes" after the 50 minutes. So we are considering a period of 150 minutes starting at t=50. So the question is, what's the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

But wait, in radioactive decay, the probability of decay in a given interval is independent of the time passed before. So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is the same as the probability it decays in any interval of 150 minutes, regardless of when.

Wait, that's the key. Radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next interval depends only on the length of the interval, not on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability for the next 150.

So regardless of the past, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as 1 - P(150), where P(150) is the probability it hasn't decayed after 150 minutes.

Wait no, wait. Because the 32% is given for 100 minutes. So perhaps to find the probability for 150 minutes, we can use the decay constant λ that we found.

Wait, let me get this straight. The 32% decay in 100 minutes gives us the decay constant. Then the probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

So let's compute that.

First, find λ. As I said,

1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ*100) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 → ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the probability that the atom decays in 150 minutes is:

P_decay = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)

Plugging in λ:

P_decay = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150)

Calculate 0.0038566 * 150: 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ ?

Hmm, e^(-0.57849). Let's think.

I know that ln(2) is about 0.693, so e^(-0.693)=0.5. So 0.57849 is a bit less than 0.693. So e^-0.57849 is a bit more than 0.5.

Compute 0.57849 is about 0.578. So e^-0.578 ≈ ?

Using calculator in mind: Let me think, e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065. e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. So 0.578 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

So let me compute 0.578 as an exponent. Let me approximate.

Let me think, 0.5: 0.6065

0.578 is 0.078 above 0.5. Let me compute the derivative of e^-x at x=0.5. The derivative is -e^-x. At x=0.5, it's about -0.6065.

So an increase of dx=0.078 in x would lead to a change in e^-x of approximately -0.6065 * 0.078 ≈ -0.0473. So e^-0.578 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0473 ≈ 0.5592.

Wait, but wait, actually, the function is e^-x, so when x increases, e^-x decreases. So e^-0.578 is less than e^-0.5. Wait, wait, no. Because 0.578 is larger than 0.5, so e^-0.578 is smaller than e^-0.5. So 0.578 is 0.078 more than 0.5. So the value is 0.6065 minus (approx) (0.6065 * 0.078) ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0473 → 0.5592.

So e^-0.578 ≈ ~0.559. So 1 - 0.559 = 0.441 → about 44.1% chance of decay in the next 150 minutes.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be the closest. But wait, I think I made an approximation in calculating e^-0.578. Let me check if there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the value more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation that λ* t = 0.57849.

So more accurately, let me compute e^-0.57849.

I can use the fact that e^0.57849 is approximately:

We know that e^0.5 = 1.64872.

e^0.6 = 1.82211.

0.57849 is 0.07849 above 0.5. Let me compute the value.

So let me compute e^0.57849.

The difference between 0.57849 and 0.5 is 0.07849.

Use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

Let me let f(x) = e^x. Then f'(x) = e^x.

At x=0.5, f'(0.5) = e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

So f(0.5 + dx) ≈ f(0.5) + f'(0.5)*dx.

dx = 0.07849.

So f(0.57849) ≈ 1.64872 + 1.64872 * 0.07849.

Compute 1.64872 * 0.07849.

Let me approximate 1.64872 * 0.07 ≈ 0.11541.

1.64872 * 0.00849 ≈ approx 0.014 (since 1.64872 * 0.008 = 0.01319, and 1.64872 * 0.00049 ≈ 0.000808). So total is about 0.013998.

So total ≈ 0.11541 + 0.013998 ≈ 0.1294.

So f(0.57849) ≈ 1.64872 + 0.1294 ≈ 1.77812.

So e^0.57849 ≈ approximately 1.77812, so e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.77812 ≈ 0.5618.

Wait, 1.778 is approximately 1.778. 1/1.778 ≈ 0.5618.

Wait, 1.778 is about 1.778. Let me compute 1 divided by 1.778.

1 / 1.778 ≈ 0.5618.

So 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382 → approximately 43.82% chance.

So that's about 43.8%, which is approximately 44%. So the answer would be option A) 44%.

Wait, but the options include option D) 48% and others. Hmm, or did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the initial information. Now, we have passed 50 minutes without decay. We need the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, another way to approach this is to find the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200. So the total time is 200 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ * 200). But wait, because the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay, does that affect the calculation? Or is it just the same as the probability of decay in 200 minutes?

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes starting at t=50 is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when it starts. So perhaps the initial 50 minutes don't change the probability for the next 150. So the probability is still the same as the 150-minute decay probability.

Wait, but wait, the 32% is for 100 minutes. So maybe I should calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes, but I already have λ from the 100-minute data.

Wait, so the process is:

1. Calculate λ using the 100-minute data.

λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

2. Then, compute the probability that the atom decays in 150 minutes. So P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

As I calculated earlier, that's approximately 44%.

But let me think again: is it the same as the 100-minute case? Because the decay is memoryless, if I have already waited 50 minutes, does that change anything?

Wait, no. Because the probability of decay in any interval depends only on the length of the interval, not on when it starts. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the next 150 minutes. So the probability is determined solely by the 150 minutes, using the same λ.

So the correct approach is to calculate 1 - e^(-λ * 150) with λ from the given 100-minute data.

Which gives us around 44%, so option A.

But wait, wait, the options don't have 44% as the correct answer, perhaps. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)44%

B)40%

C)52%

D)48%

Hmm, my calculation gives around 44%, so A is the option.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of lambda. Let me double-check the calculation of lambda.

Given that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ*100)=0.68.

So taking natural logs:

-λ * 100 = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Compute ln(0.68):

ln(0.68) ≈ ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, but 0.68 is smaller than 0.7, so ln(0.68) is more negative.

Wait, let me compute ln(0.68) accurately. Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll use some approximations.

We know that ln(2/3) ≈ ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055.

Wait, 0.68 is a bit higher than 2/3 (≈0.6667), so ln(0.68) is less negative than ln(2/3). Let me use a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, using the Taylor series expansion for ln(x) around x=1.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.32^2)/2 - (0.32^3)/3 - ... .

Wait, that might be more accurate.

So ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) ≈ -0.32 - (0.1024)/2 - (0.032768)/3 - (0.01048576)/4 - ...

Calculating each term:

-0.32

-0.1024/2 = -0.0512 → total so far: -0.3712

-0.032768/3 ≈ -0.01092 → total: -0.38212

-0.01048576/4 ≈ -0.00262144 → total: -0.38474.

Next term: (0.0033554432)/5 → 0.0006710886. But wait, the expansion is ln(1 - x) = -x - x^2/2 - x^3/3 - x^4/4 - ..., so the next term is +x^4/(4*1), but wait, no: it's actually x is 0.32, so:

Wait, ln(1 - x) = -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - x⁴/4 - ... for x < 1.

So each term is negative, so the expansion is:

ln(0.68) = ln(1 - 0.32) = -0.32 - (0.32)^2/2 - (0.32)^3/3 - (0.32)^4/4 - ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: -0.32

Second term: -(0.32)^2 / 2 = -(0.1024)/2 = -0.0512 → sum: -0.3712

Third term: -(0.32)^3/3 = -(0.032768)/3 ≈ -0.0109227 → sum: -0.38212

Fourth term: -(0.32)^4/4 = -(0.01048576)/4 ≈ -0.00262144 → sum: -0.3847414

Fifth term: -(0.32)^5/5 = -(0.0033554432)/5 ≈ -0.0006710886 → sum: -0.38541249

Wait, but 0.32^5 is 0.32^4 * 0.32 → 0.01048576 * 0.32 = 0.0033554432.

So fifth term is about -0.000671.

Adding that to the sum gives about -0.38541249.

But how accurate is this? Let's say it's about -0.38566, which is approximately what I thought earlier.

So lambda is ln(0.68) = -0.38566. So λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, moving on to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.

So e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-0.0038566 * 150) = e^(-0.57849).

As I calculated earlier, e^(-0.57849) is approximately 0.559, so 1 - 0.559 = 0.441 → 44.1% chance.

But wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe the options round differently.

Wait, perhaps I should find the exact value. Let's compute 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849.

I can compute this using the fact that e^0.57849 is approximately 1.7818. Because e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.57849 is a bit higher.

Wait, another approach: the natural logarithm of 1.7818 is approximately 0.57849.

Let me check: ln(1.78) is about 0.576. Because e^0.576 ≈ 1.778.

Hmm, that's close. So e^0.576 ≈ 1.778. So e^0.57849 would be a bit higher, maybe around 1.781.

Thus, e^-0.57849 ≈ 1/1.781 ≈ 0.5612.

Thus, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388 → 43.88%≈44%.

So the answer should be option A)44%.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes people get confused between the probability over a certain time and the conditional probability.

Wait, an alternative approach would be to consider that the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay, so the remaining lifetime is being considered.

But no, the decay is memoryless, so the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as for any 150-minute interval, regardless of previous time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to think in terms of conditional probability. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but that would be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, because the decay process is memoryless. So the conditional probability is just the probability of decaying in that 150-minute interval.

Wait, conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B).

In this case, A is the event that it decays in the next 150 minutes (t=50 to t=200), and B is the event that it hasn't decayed by t=50.

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But P(A and B) is the probability that it has not decayed by t=50, and then decays between t=50 and t=200.

Which is [e^(-λ*50)] * [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

P(B) is e^(-λ *50).

So P(A|B) = [e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ*150)))] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, regardless of the prior 50 minutes.

So that's consistent with the earlier approach. So the answer is approximately 44%, so option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 48%. Could I have made a calculation error?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute e^-0.57849 more accurately.

Let me think, I can compute e^-0.57849 by considering that 0.57849 = 0.5 + 0.07849.

We know that e^-0.5 = 0.6065.

Now, e^-(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849.

We can compute e^-0.07849 using the Taylor series.

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6, where x is small.

x = -0.07849.

So e^-0.07849 ≈ 1 + (-0.07849) + (0.07849^2)/2 + (- (0.07849)^3)/6.

Calculate each term:

1 =1.

-0.07849 → + (-0.07849) → 0.92151.

(0.07849^2)/2: 0.07849^2 = 0.006161. Divided by 2: 0.0030805.

Next term: -(0.07849)^3 /6 → 0.07849^3 = 0.07849 * 0.07849 *0.07849 ≈ 0.000482. Divided by 6: ≈ 0.0000803. So negative: -0.0000803.

Adding all up:

1 → 1

-0.07849 → 0.92151

+0.0030805 → 0.9245905

-0.0000803 → 0.9245102.

So e^-0.07849 ≈ approximately 0.92451.

So e^-0.57849 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92451 ≈ let's compute that.

0.6 * 0.92451 = 0.554706.

0.0065 * 0.92451 ≈ 0.0060093.

So total is approximately 0.554706 + 0.0060093 = 0.560715.

So e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5607.

Thus, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 → 43.93% ≈ 44%.

So the correct answer is 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using approximations, \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), so:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the decay formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

To compute \( e^{-0.57849} \), we approximate \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5607 \). Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
P(150) \approx 43.93\% \, \text{(approximately 44\%)}.
\]

Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.

From the given options:

- **A) 44%**
- **B) 40%**
- **C) 52%**
- **D) 48%**

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A
