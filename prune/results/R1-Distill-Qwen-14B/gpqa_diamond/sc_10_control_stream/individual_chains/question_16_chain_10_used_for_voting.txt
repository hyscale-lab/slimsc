Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is asking how many of the given compounds are optically active. I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, but wait, there are exceptions. Like, if there's a plane of symmetry or if it's meso compound, it won't be chiral even if it has stereocenters.

Alright, let's list out the compounds one by one. There are seven compounds, so I'll go through each and figure out if they're chiral.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, I think this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z, which is about the arrangement of the groups around the double bond. But wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, not just a double bond. Unless the double bond has some kind of stereogenic effect, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, maybe this molecule isn't chiral because it's a double bond but the arrangement is such that it doesn't create a chiral center. Or maybe it's a possibility of a stereogenic center. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw the structure. It's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 has Cl, a double bond (so two substituents), a CH2CH3 maybe? Wait, but wait. The structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, no? Wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, no. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me correct. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH(CH3))CH2CH3, I think. No, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH(CH3))... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but I think I'm overcomplicating. The main point is, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me see: the molecule is (Z)-configured. But Z configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. So the substituents on each side are arranged in a certain way. But does that create a chiral center? I don't think so, because the double bond itself can't be a chiral center. Wait, the carbons in the double bond are spÂ² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers because they have three substituents (including the double bond). So (Z) configuration doesn't make a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it won't be optically active. So compound 1 is not chiral.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Oh, this is a more complex structure. Let's think about it. The substituents are at certain positions, and the configuration is given as R and S, so there's definitely a chiral center. Wait, but the formula includes E configuration, which is about the double bond. But the main point is, the molecule has stereocenters. So if the molecule is not symmetrical, it should be chiral. So this one is chiral. So compound 2 is chiral.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Here, substituents are on C2 and C3. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Let's see: succinic acid is two CH2 groups. 2,3-dimethyl would mean each of those CH2 groups has a methyl. Wait, no, because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has a methyl group. Now, the configurations are R and S. So we have two chiral centers. But wait, could this be a meso compound? Because if the configurations are opposite, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the two chiral centers are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's possible. The structure would be symmetric if the R and S configurations are on adjacent carbons. In succinic acid, the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons, each with a methyl group. So if one is R and the other is S, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Let me imagine: the structure is HOOC-CH(R)-CH(S)-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, but given their positions, does that lead to a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the molecule. If the two CH groups are on the same side or opposite? Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound. Because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the configurations are opposite. For example, imagine the two methyl groups are on the same side when looking from the top. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think of tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two chiral centers with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if 2R and 3S, and the substituents are the same (methyl groups), then perhaps it's a meso compound, which is achiral. Oh wait, but the substituents on each chiral center are the same: on C2, it's methyl; on C3, also methyl. So if the configurations are R and S, could the molecule be meso? I think so. Because if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it's meso. Like in meso-tartaric acid, where the two stereocenters are opposite and the molecule is symmetrical. So in that case, (2R,3S) would lead to a meso compound, which is achiral. So this compound would not be optically active. So compound 3 is not chiral.

Wait, wait, but wait: in succinic acid, the two central carbons each have two CH2 groups. When we add methyl groups, each becomes CH(CH3). The configurations are R and S. So for each chiral center, the groups are: for C2, the substituents would be methyl, two CH2 groups, and the COOH groups. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's say C2 is connected to COOH, CH(CH3), another CH2, and the other COOH. Hmm, it's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso. Because in the case of meso compounds, the substituents around each chiral center need to be arranged in a way that allows a plane of symmetry. Let me think again: if the two chiral centers are adjacent and have opposite configurations, and the substituents are the same on each, then yes, it's a meso compound. So in this case, each has a methyl group, so substituents are same. So if 2R and 3S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. Therefore, it's not chiral. So compound 3 is not chiral.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the configurations are R and R. So this is another case. Now, with both R and R configurations, would this lead to a chiral molecule or not? Let's see: if both chiral centers have R configuration, then there's no plane of symmetry. Because if both are R, then the arrangement would not mirror. In this case, the molecule would not be meso. So the molecule would have two chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So compound 4 is chiral.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Cyclohexanol is a cyclic molecule. The substituents here are an OH group on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond starting at C3, and an OH at C1. Now, the configuration is R. So the question is, is the molecule chiral? Well, the OH is at C1, which is a chiral center. So if the configuration is R, then it's a chiral center. But wait, is the molecule symmetrical? Let me think: the cyclohexene ring with substituents could have some symmetry. But in this case, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me imagine the positions: C1 has OH, and the double bond is elsewhere. So the cyclohexane ring isn't symmetrical in a way that would cancel the chirality. Hence, this molecule is chiral. So compound 5 is chiral.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are s configuration. Now, the question is, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think about the structure. If the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Because the positions are all opposite each other. If all are in the same configuration (s), that might create a symmetrical arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because the positions are not mirror images. Wait, the positions 1,3,5 form a trigonal arrangement on the ring. If all OH groups are in the same configuration (all s), then the molecule might not be symmetrical. Wait, but the arrangement of substituents in a ring can sometimes lead to internal planes of symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If all substituents are axial or equatorial, perhaps. But in any case, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a chiral molecule. Hmm. Let me think: if the three OH groups are all on the same face, then the molecule would be chiral. But if they are arranged in a symmetric way, it might not be. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the arrangement is such that it's superimposable on its mirror image. Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters. There are three stereocenters here, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me think: in a cyclohexane ring, with substituents at 1,3,5, all being OH groups. If each is in s configuration, which direction does that lead? For cyclohexane, the axial positions are up and down. If all OH groups are axial and pointing in the same direction, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possibilities: if all three substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, then it's not chiral. For example, if each substituent is a mirror image across a plane, then it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. Wait, but meso compounds are typically for molecules with multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the three OH groups are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, another angle: If the substituents are all on the same face, then the molecule would be chiral. But if they alternate, perhaps not. Wait, 1,3,5-triol on a cyclohexane ring. If all OHs are on the same face (like all axial up), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry because of the positions. Because positions 1,3,5 are opposite each other. So if all OHs are on one face, the molecule would have a mirror plane, making it achiral. So in this case, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration would make the substituents all on the same face, leading to a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is meso, so it's not chiral. So compound 6 is not chiral.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the 1-position of butanone, and a methyl group on the 3-position. Let me imagine the structure: the ketone is at C1, so structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. The structure is butan-1-one, which is (CH2)3-CO. So butanone is (CH3)2CO, but butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, butanone is usually 2-butanone (which is (CH3)2CO). So butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-C-

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, butanone has four carbons. 1-ketone would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 1-cyclopentyl would mean the ketone is attached to the cyclopentyl group. So the structure is cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-something? Wait, perhaps it's more like:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, but butanone is four carbons in a row. So 1-ketone is the first carbon. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-... No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure. Butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. So, the carbonyl group is on the first carbon. So the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon, and a methyl group on the third carbon. So it's:

O
||
C(O)-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)

Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because that would be a five-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. But butan-1-one is probably not a common structure because ketones are generally more stable in the middle. But regardless, the point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2-CH(CH3)2? Not exactly, but somewhere in there, is there a chiral center? The carbonyl group is on C1, so that's a ketone. C2 is connected to the carbonyl, and has two CH2 groups and a CH(CH3). Wait, let me see: if C2 is connected to carbonyl, a CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups, perhaps it's a chiral center. Wait, but wait: C2 is connected to O=C-R, and then two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). So if the four substituents are: O=C-R, CH2CH(CH3)2, and two other groups, maybe. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is the chiral center. Because C3 has a methyl group, and is connected to C2 and C4. Let me think: the molecule is O=C-R (where R is cyclopentyl group), then connected to CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to determine if any carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Let's think about the carbons:

- C1: carbonyl (double bond, so spÂ², not a center)
- C2: connected to C1 (carbonyl), two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3)
Wait, so the substituents on C2 would be: carbonyl group, two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). Are any of these the same? Well, two CH2 groups are the same, so C2 would have two identical substituents. Therefore, C2 can't be a chiral center. What about C3? C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2), a methyl group, and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps:

The chain is as follows:

O=C-R (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

So, the carbons are 1 (carbonyl), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

So, C3 is CH(CH3). What are its substituents? It's connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group, and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen. Wait, no, in that case, substituents would be: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So are any of those the same? The two CH2 groups are the same (each is CH2-). So substituents are: two CH2 groups, methyl, and H. So C3 has four different substituents? Wait: CH2, CH2, CH3, H. So, two CH2 groups are the same, so no, C3 cannot be a chiral center. Similarly, C4 is CH2, so substituents are CH(CH3), two CH2, and H. So, any chiral centers in this molecule? Maybe C2: substituents are O=C-R, CH2 (from C3), CH2 (from C2's other side), and another substituent? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because, perhaps, all the carbons either have duplicate substituents or are spÂ² hybridized. Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in that case, the C2 is CH2, which is connected to O=C, two CH2 groups, and a CH2CH3. So that can't be a chiral center. So overall, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't optical active. So compound 7 is not chiral.

So, to sum up:

1. Not chiral.
2. Chiral.
3. Not chiral (meso).
4. Chiral.
5. Chiral.
6. Not chiral (meso).
7. Not chiral.

So counting the chiral ones: compounds 2,4,5. That's three. Wait, no, let me recount:

Wait, compound 2: yes.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: yes.

Compound5: yes.

Compound 6: no.

Compound7: no.

So that's three chiral compounds. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the first compound: not chiral.

Second: chiral (yes).

Third: no.

Fourth: yes.

Fifth: yes.

Sixth: no.

Seventh: no.

So that's 2,4,5: three compounds. So the total is three. The options are:

A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be option B)3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks internal symmetry (e.g., no plane of symmetry or being a meso compound).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond with (Z) configuration. However, double bonds cannot be chiral centers, and the molecule lacks any stereogenic centers. Therefore, it is **not chiral**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has stereocenters (R and S configurations) and no internal symmetry. It is **chiral**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid with (2R,3S) configuration has two chiral centers. However, this arrangement creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Thus, it is **not chiral**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers, but the (2R,3R) configuration does not result in a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule lacks internal symmetry. Thus, it is **chiral**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it is **not chiral**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers because all carbons either have duplicate substituents or are spÂ² hybridized. Thus, it is **not chiral**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is asking how many of the given compounds are optically active. I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, but wait, there are exceptions. Like, if there's a plane of symmetry or if it's meso compound, it won't be chiral even if it has stereocenters.

Alright, let's list out the compounds one by one. There are seven compounds, so I'll go through each and figure out if they're chiral.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, I think this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z, which is about the arrangement of the groups around the double bond. But wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, not just a double bond. Unless the double bond has some kind of stereogenic effect, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, maybe this molecule isn't chiral because it's a double bond but the arrangement is such that it doesn't create a chiral center. Or maybe it's a possibility of a stereogenic center. Let me think: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw the structure. It's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 has Cl, a double bond (so two substituents), a CH2CH3 maybe? Wait, but wait. The structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, no? Wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, no. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me correct. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH(CH3))CH2CH3, I think. No, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH(CH3))... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but I think I'm overcomplicating. The main point is, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me see: the molecule is (Z)-configured. But Z configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. So the substituents on each side are arranged in a certain way. But does that create a chiral center? I don't think so, because the double bond itself can't be a chiral center. Wait, the carbons in the double bond are spÂ² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers because they have three substituents (including the double bond). So (Z) configuration doesn't make a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it won't be optically active. So compound 1 is not chiral.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Oh, this is a more complex structure. Let's think about it. The substituents are at certain positions, and the configuration is given as R and S, so there's definitely a chiral center. Wait, but the formula includes E configuration, which is about the double bond. But the main point is, the molecule has stereocenters. So if the molecule is not symmetrical, it should be chiral. So this one is chiral. So compound 2 is chiral.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Here, substituents are on C2 and C3. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no. Let's see: succinic acid is two CH2 groups. 2,3-dimethyl would mean each of those CH2 groups has a methyl. Wait, no, because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has a methyl group. Now, the configurations are R and S. So we have two chiral centers. But wait, could this be a meso compound? Because if the configurations are opposite, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if the two chiral centers are R and S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's possible. The structure would be symmetric if the R and S configurations are on adjacent carbons. In succinic acid, the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons, each with a methyl group. So if one is R and the other is S, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Let me imagine: the structure is HOOC-CH(R)-CH(S)-COOH. If the configurations are R and S, but given their positions, does that lead to a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the molecule. If the two CH groups are on the same side or opposite? Wait, perhaps it's a meso compound. Because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the configurations are opposite. For example, imagine the two methyl groups are on the same side when looking from the top. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, let's think of tartaric acid as an example. The meso form has two chiral centers with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if 2R and 3S, and the substituents are the same (methyl groups), then perhaps it's a meso compound, which is achiral. Oh wait, but the substituents on each chiral center are the same: on C2, it's methyl; on C3, also methyl. So if the configurations are R and S, could the molecule be meso? I think so. Because if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it's meso. Like in meso-tartaric acid, where the two stereocenters are opposite and the molecule is symmetrical. So in that case, (2R,3S) would lead to a meso compound, which is achiral. So this compound would not be optically active. So compound 3 is not chiral.

Wait, wait, but wait: in succinic acid, the two central carbons each have two CH2 groups. When we add methyl groups, each becomes CH(CH3). The configurations are R and S. So for each chiral center, the groups are: for C2, the substituents would be methyl, two CH2 groups, and the COOH groups. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's say C2 is connected to COOH, CH(CH3), another CH2, and the other COOH. Hmm, it's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso. Because in the case of meso compounds, the substituents around each chiral center need to be arranged in a way that allows a plane of symmetry. Let me think again: if the two chiral centers are adjacent and have opposite configurations, and the substituents are the same on each, then yes, it's a meso compound. So in this case, each has a methyl group, so substituents are same. So if 2R and 3S, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso. Therefore, it's not chiral. So compound 3 is not chiral.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the configurations are R and R. So this is another case. Now, with both R and R configurations, would this lead to a chiral molecule or not? Let's see: if both chiral centers have R configuration, then there's no plane of symmetry. Because if both are R, then the arrangement would not mirror. In this case, the molecule would not be meso. So the molecule would have two chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So compound 4 is chiral.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Cyclohexanol is a cyclic molecule. The substituents here are an OH group on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, the structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the ring has a double bond starting at C3, and an OH at C1. Now, the configuration is R. So the question is, is the molecule chiral? Well, the OH is at C1, which is a chiral center. So if the configuration is R, then it's a chiral center. But wait, is the molecule symmetrical? Let me think: the cyclohexene ring with substituents could have some symmetry. But in this case, the OH is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me imagine the positions: C1 has OH, and the double bond is elsewhere. So the cyclohexane ring isn't symmetrical in a way that would cancel the chirality. Hence, this molecule is chiral. So compound 5 is chiral.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So this is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are s configuration. Now, the question is, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think about the structure. If the substituents are on 1,3,5 positions, which are every other carbon, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Because the positions are all opposite each other. If all are in the same configuration (s), that might create a symmetrical arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical because the positions are not mirror images. Wait, the positions 1,3,5 form a trigonal arrangement on the ring. If all OH groups are in the same configuration (all s), then the molecule might not be symmetrical. Wait, but the arrangement of substituents in a ring can sometimes lead to internal planes of symmetry. Let me imagine the chair conformation. If all substituents are axial or equatorial, perhaps. But in any case, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a chiral molecule. Hmm. Let me think: if the three OH groups are all on the same face, then the molecule would be chiral. But if they are arranged in a symmetric way, it might not be. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the arrangement is such that it's superimposable on its mirror image. Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters. There are three stereocenters here, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me think: in a cyclohexane ring, with substituents at 1,3,5, all being OH groups. If each is in s configuration, which direction does that lead? For cyclohexane, the axial positions are up and down. If all OH groups are axial and pointing in the same direction, maybe the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possibilities: if all three substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, then it's not chiral. For example, if each substituent is a mirror image across a plane, then it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. Wait, but meso compounds are typically for molecules with multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if the three OH groups are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, another angle: If the substituents are all on the same face, then the molecule would be chiral. But if they alternate, perhaps not. Wait, 1,3,5-triol on a cyclohexane ring. If all OHs are on the same face (like all axial up), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry because of the positions. Because positions 1,3,5 are opposite each other. So if all OHs are on one face, the molecule would have a mirror plane, making it achiral. So in this case, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration would make the substituents all on the same face, leading to a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is meso, so it's not chiral. So compound 6 is not chiral.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the 1-position of butanone, and a methyl group on the 3-position. Let me imagine the structure: the ketone is at C1, so structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. The structure is butan-1-one, which is (CH2)3-CO. So butanone is (CH3)2CO, but butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, butanone is usually 2-butanone (which is (CH3)2CO). So butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, actually, butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-C-

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, butanone has four carbons. 1-ketone would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 1-cyclopentyl would mean the ketone is attached to the cyclopentyl group. So the structure is cyclopentyl-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-something? Wait, perhaps it's more like:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, but butanone is four carbons in a row. So 1-ketone is the first carbon. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO-... No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structure. Butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. So, the carbonyl group is on the first carbon. So the structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the first carbon, and a methyl group on the third carbon. So it's:

O
||
C(O)-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)

Wait, but butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because that would be a five-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. But butan-1-one is probably not a common structure because ketones are generally more stable in the middle. But regardless, the point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Let's see: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2-CH(CH3)2? Not exactly, but somewhere in there, is there a chiral center? The carbonyl group is on C1, so that's a ketone. C2 is connected to the carbonyl, and has two CH2 groups and a CH(CH3). Wait, let me see: if C2 is connected to carbonyl, a CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups, perhaps it's a chiral center. Wait, but wait: C2 is connected to O=C-R, and then two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). So if the four substituents are: O=C-R, CH2CH(CH3)2, and two other groups, maybe. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C3 is the chiral center. Because C3 has a methyl group, and is connected to C2 and C4. Let me think: the molecule is O=C-R (where R is cyclopentyl group), then connected to CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to determine if any carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Let's think about the carbons:

- C1: carbonyl (double bond, so spÂ², not a center)
- C2: connected to C1 (carbonyl), two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3)
Wait, so the substituents on C2 would be: carbonyl group, two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). Are any of these the same? Well, two CH2 groups are the same, so C2 would have two identical substituents. Therefore, C2 can't be a chiral center. What about C3? C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2), a methyl group, and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps:

The chain is as follows:

O=C-R (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

So, the carbons are 1 (carbonyl), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

So, C3 is CH(CH3). What are its substituents? It's connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group, and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen. Wait, no, in that case, substituents would be: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So are any of those the same? The two CH2 groups are the same (each is CH2-). So substituents are: two CH2 groups, methyl, and H. So C3 has four different substituents? Wait: CH2, CH2, CH3, H. So, two CH2 groups are the same, so no, C3 cannot be a chiral center. Similarly, C4 is CH2, so substituents are CH(CH3), two CH2, and H. So, any chiral centers in this molecule? Maybe C2: substituents are O=C-R, CH2 (from C3), CH2 (from C2's other side), and another substituent? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because, perhaps, all the carbons either have duplicate substituents or are spÂ² hybridized. Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So in that case, the C2 is CH2, which is connected to O=C, two CH2 groups, and a CH2CH3. So that can't be a chiral center. So overall, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't optical active. So compound 7 is not chiral.

So, to sum up:

1. Not chiral.
2. Chiral.
3. Not chiral (meso).
4. Chiral.
5. Chiral.
6. Not chiral (meso).
7. Not chiral.

So counting the chiral ones: compounds 2,4,5. That's three. Wait, no, let me recount:

Wait, compound 2: yes.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: yes.

Compound5: yes.

Compound 6: no.

Compound7: no.

So that's three chiral compounds. Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the first compound: not chiral.

Second: chiral (yes).

Third: no.

Fourth: yes.

Fifth: yes.

Sixth: no.

Seventh: no.

So that's 2,4,5: three compounds. So the total is three. The options are:

A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the answer would be option B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks internal symmetry (e.g., no plane of symmetry or being a meso compound).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond with (Z) configuration. However, double bonds cannot be chiral centers, and the molecule lacks any stereogenic centers. Therefore, it is **not chiral**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has stereocenters (R and S configurations) and no internal symmetry. It is **chiral**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid with (2R,3S) configuration has two chiral centers. However, this arrangement creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Thus, it is **not chiral**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers, but the (2R,3R) configuration does not result in a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **chiral**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule lacks internal symmetry. Thus, it is **chiral**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration creates a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it is **not chiral**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers because all carbons either have duplicate substituents or are spÂ² hybridized. Thus, it is **not chiral**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.
