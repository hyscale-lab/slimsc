Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. The task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and with a specific structure. The 1,3 positions have bromine atoms, so when heated with excess KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction. 

Wait, KOH is a strong base. So, when dibromides react with a strong base, usually an E2 elimination happens. Since both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in a rigid structure, heating would lead to the formation of an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps a different diene? Hmm. 

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules when treated with a strong base. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, but not directly next to each other. Wait, adamantane's structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3 positions are across two rings. When KOH is used, each Br would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons. So the product after KOH would be 1,3-diene adamantane. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, maybe it's not a diene but an epoxide? Wait, no, because KOH wouldn't form an epoxide. 

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal bromides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with a strong base like KOH, they eliminate to form an alkene. But in this case, the dibromide is 1,3-dibromo. So the two Br atoms are on carbons that are two apart. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-diene, but wait, that's not possible because of the structure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a diene across the bridge.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Dieckmann elimination? No, that's for cyclic ketones. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), and other peaks. 4.79 is around where vinyl protons or maybe alkoxy protons appear. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but product 1 is formed from heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. So if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, maybe it's a diketone? No, because KOH would need to oxidize something, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the product is an cyclopropane or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene, but the IR peak suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it could form a ketone through elimination. Wait, but how? Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and the structure is such that elimination forms a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't see how the IR would show a carbonyl in that case.

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but an epoxide. Epoxide rings have oxygen, and the IR would show an absorption around 1250 cm^-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is higher, more like a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the first step.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But if two Br atoms are present, and excess KOH, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would lead to a diol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 cm^-1 (which would be for O-H stretch) so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone. But how? Maybe if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, KOH is a base, but in some cases, like dehydrohalogenation, you get alkenes. If the positions are right, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but then why the IR peak for a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data. The NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's an epoxide where the adjacent CH2 protons are deshielded. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a geminal diol, but again, the O-H stretch would be present in IR.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. The 4.79 ppm could be the protons on the epoxide ring. Let me think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses HBr twice and forms an epoxide, that would require a four-membered ring? Or perhaps a smaller ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should think about the other steps and see if that helps.

The second step is product 1 heated with excess Al(OiPr)3, which is aluminum isopropoxide. This is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720 cm^-1). So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then heating with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to some kind of enol ether formation or perhaps a rearrangement. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then maybe the Al is causing ring opening.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone or an ester. Let me think: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense because dehydrohalogenation would form alkenes, not ketones. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but I don't see the carbonyl then.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps a double E2 elimination occurs, each Br losing a H to form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene adamantane. But then, the IR would not show a carbonyl, so I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Let's imagine that. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide upon reaction with KOH. How? Because in some cases, vicinal dihalides can form epoxides if treated with a base. Wait, wait, vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihalides) can form epoxides under certain conditions, but 1,3-dibromide isn't vicinal. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide but formed via a different mechanism. Or maybe the product isn't an epoxide but another structure. Let me think again about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde, but that would be higher in ppm. 

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH produces a carbonyl compound. How? Maybe it's a Fries rearrangement, but that's for aryl esters. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination leading to a conjugated carbonyl. 

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a conjugated diene or a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination usually gives alkenes, not ketones. Unless there's some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming two alkenes and releasing two HBr molecules. So the product would have two double bonds. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. If two adjacent Br atoms undergo elimination, forming a cyclopropane ring. But then, would that produce a carbonyl? No, cyclopropane wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe through a ring-opening of some sort. If the adamantane structure opens up, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes two E2 eliminations to form a conjugated diene. But then, where is the carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step, so perhaps I should try to proceed and see if the later steps give me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess Al(OiPr)3. Al is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation or alkylation. If product 1 is a ketone, then Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 would need to have a benzene ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al is causing ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the Al is inducing some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about the integration. 2H, 10H, and 2H. So 14 H in total? Adamantane has 10 H in the rings (each bridge position has two CH2 groups). So product 1 must have more hydrogens. Wait, perhaps product 1 has a CH2O group, which would account for the 2H at 4.79. The 10H in the 2.41-2.23 region could be from bridgehead CH2 groups. So it's possible that product 1 is a ketone, maybe like adamantanedione. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diketone. If each Br is replaced by an O, but that would require oxidation. Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a ketone through some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination with each Br losing H and forming a double bond, making a diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So I'm confused. Maybe I should look for other clues.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is typically used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond. But depending on the structure, it might form different products. After ozonolysis, adding dimethyl sulfide typically leads to reductive work-up, but sometimes leads to breaking the ozonides into carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from these carbonyl groups, but wait, carbonyls don't show in 1H NMR. Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, in ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved. For example, if product 2 is a diene, like a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups and perhaps some aldehyde or ketone protons, depending on the structure.

So, the most deshielded protons in product 3 would be those adjacent to carbonyl groups. These are typically deshielded and appear as triplets or other coupling patterns depending on their neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis, the original diene is cleaved. Let me think: if product 2 is a diene, say, (CH2)2 groups with a double bond between them, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-diene adamantane, ozonolysis would break each double bond. Wait, but if it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis at -78Â°C (which is a milder condition) would typically result in the formation of ozonides, which upon work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, not a diene. Because if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's imagine product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps an enol ether is formed via some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a ketone with a neighboring double bond, making it a conjugated enone.

Wait, another approach: The initial reaction with KOH could be causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But that's probably not the case, as adamantane is very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is a bridged bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, say, 1,3-diketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen rearrangement or some pericyclic reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the second step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but since product 1 doesn't have an aromatic ring, that's probably not it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me try to think differently. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Its NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) which could be a CH2 attached to an O. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) must be from bridgehead CH2 groups, and 1.94 (2H) perhaps from a CH2 adjacent to something electronegative.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Adamantane with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So, the structure would have two carbonyls, each attached to a bridgehead. Then, the NMR would show the bridgehead protons as the 10H in the 2.41-2.23 range. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from some other group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the product 2. Product 2 is treated with ozone, which suggests it has a double bond. So product 2 must be an alkene. So, the second step, which is heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3, must form an alkene. How does that happen?

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is inducing some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a tertiary alcohol, heating with a Lewis acid could lead to the formation of an alkene via an E1 or E2 mechanism. But product 1 is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al(OiPr)3 is causing ring-opening to form an alkene. Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, the NMR would have peaks for the epoxide protons, which are usually deshielded and appear around 3-4 ppm. But product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is higher, maybe indicating something else.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but without the O-H stretch in IR, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. The IR at 1720 could be an ester carbonyl. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could induce some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, like an adamantanone ester, then the Al could cause an elimination, producing an alkene and an alcohol, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Al is causing a retro-aldol cleavage or some rearrangement.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so let's move on to the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed, leading to product 3. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

But product 3's NMR is what we're interested in. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In an aldehyde, the H is very deshielded and appears around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in product 3, the peak isn't that, but perhaps another scenario.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, say, a single double bond somewhere. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps making two ketone or aldehyde groups. Then, the protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

For example, if product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, in product 3, the protons next to the carbonyl (like on a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone) would have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, but the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually singlets because they're at the end of the chain and have no adjacent protons. But that doesn't fit any of the options given, which are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for example, a CH2-CO group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with each other (geminal coupling, which is usually not observed because they're equivalent) and with adjacent protons. Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group, their coupling would be more complex.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 3. If product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a molecule with a double bond and two CH2 groups adjacent to it. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to their respective CH2 groups.

So, product 3 would have a structure like O=C-R, where R is a CH2 group. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.1-2.3 ppm, perhaps. These protons would couple with each other (as a triplet due to vicinal coupling) and perhaps with other protons nearby.

Wait, but in the case of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would be adjacent to two others: their own geminal (but they are equivalent, so no splitting) and perhaps the neighboring group. Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's protons would couple with each other and with any neighboring groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those protons is coupled to two others. Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a diene, like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyls. But that's a linear molecule, so after cleavage, you'd have two carbonyls at each end. But in a cyclic structure, the cleavage would form two carbonyls connected by a chain.

But product 3's NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. These CH2 protons would be split into a triplet if each H is coupled with two equivalent H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, for example, if each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, the protons on each CH2 are adjacent to the carbonyl and to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Wait, but each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's (on the same CH2) and perhaps one on the adjacent CH2. But if the adjacent CH2 is also a CH2 group, then each H would have two neighbors (from their own CH2) and two from the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets or some more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupling with two different sets of H's. For instance, each H on CH2-A is coupling with the two H's on CH2-B. If CH2-A and CH2-B are each a pair of equivalent H's, then each H on CH2-A would couple with two H's on CH2-B. That would lead to a triplet for each H on CH2-A, as each has two neighboring H's on CH2-B.

Wait, but if the coupling is between two equivalent protons on adjacent groups, then each H would be split into a triplet. For example:

Each H on CH2-A is coupled with two H's on CH2-B. Since the two H's on CH2-B are equivalent, each H on CH2-A would see them as a single doublet with coupling constant J. But wait, each H on CH2-A is coupled with two H's on CH2-B. So the splitting would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2).

So each H on CH2-A would be a triplet, because they're coupling with two equivalent H's on CH2-B.

But wait, if the CH2 groups are adjacent and each has two H's, then each H on CH2-A is adjacent to two H's on CH2-B. So the splitting would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more coupling. If each H on CH2-A is also coupled with their own geminal H and with H's from another group, the pattern could be more complex. But in the case of a simple CH2-CH2 arrangement, each H would only couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in reality, the structure may have more substituents. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. Then each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each CH2 has two H's, and each H is coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet. 

But wait, in that case, the coupling would be between each H and two equivalent H's. So each H would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern is a triplet.

So the correct answer would be A) triplet.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and progressing through several steps to form product 3. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3.

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, which likely results in a double elimination reaction. Each bromine atom is eliminated along with a Î²-hydrogen, forming a conjugated diene (1,3-diene adamantane). The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, which is inconsistent with a diene. Instead, this suggests the formation of a compound with a carbonyl group. The most plausible explanation is that the reaction forms a diketone (1,3-diketone adamantane), where the two carbonyl groups are located on adjacent carbons.

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)â
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)â), a strong Lewis acid. This step likely induces a rearrangement, forming a conjugated enone (product 2). The enone structure contains a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond, which is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) contains carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved. The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are those on the CHâ groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

### Step 4: Coupling Pattern in Product 3
The CHâ groups adjacent to carbonyl groups are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl. Each hydrogen on these CHâ groups couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group. This results in a splitting pattern where each hydrogen appears as a **triplet** due to coupling with two equivalent hydrogens.

### Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with the coupling pattern of a hydrogen atom on a CHâ group adjacent to another CHâ group, where each hydrogen is coupled with two equivalent hydrogens.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of hydrogens, which is not the case here.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen and two equivalent hydrogens, which is not applicable here.
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.

The correct coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. The task is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and with a specific structure. The 1,3 positions have bromine atoms, so when heated with excess KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction. 

Wait, KOH is a strong base. So, when dibromides react with a strong base, usually an E2 elimination happens. Since both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons in a rigid structure, heating would lead to the formation of an alkene. The product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps a different diene? Hmm. 

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules when treated with a strong base. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, but not directly next to each other. Wait, adamantane's structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3 positions are across two rings. When KOH is used, each Br would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons. So the product after KOH would be 1,3-diene adamantane. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, maybe it's not a diene but an epoxide? Wait, no, because KOH wouldn't form an epoxide. 

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal bromides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with a strong base like KOH, they eliminate to form an alkene. But in this case, the dibromide is 1,3-dibromo. So the two Br atoms are on carbons that are two apart. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be 1,3-diene, but wait, that's not possible because of the structure. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination would form a diene across the bridge.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Dieckmann elimination? No, that's for cyclic ketones. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), and other peaks. 4.79 is around where vinyl protons or maybe alkoxy protons appear. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but product 1 is formed from heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. So if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, maybe it's a diketone? No, because KOH would need to oxidize something, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the product is an cyclopropane or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diene, but the IR peak suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the first step. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it could form a ketone through elimination. Wait, but how? Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and the structure is such that elimination forms a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an epoxide, but I don't see how the IR would show a carbonyl in that case.

Wait, maybe the product is not an alkene but an epoxide. Epoxide rings have oxygen, and the IR would show an absorption around 1250 cm^-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is higher, more like a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the first step.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But if two Br atoms are present, and excess KOH, maybe it's a double substitution, but that would lead to a diol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 cm^-1 (which would be for O-H stretch) so maybe it's not a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone. But how? Maybe if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, KOH is a base, but in some cases, like dehydrohalogenation, you get alkenes. If the positions are right, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but then why the IR peak for a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data. The NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's an epoxide where the adjacent CH2 protons are deshielded. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a geminal diol, but again, the O-H stretch would be present in IR.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: if the product is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. The 4.79 ppm could be the protons on the epoxide ring. Let me think about the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses HBr twice and forms an epoxide, that would require a four-membered ring? Or perhaps a smaller ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should think about the other steps and see if that helps.

The second step is product 1 heated with excess Al(OiPr)3, which is aluminum isopropoxide. This is a strong Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl group (IR at 1720 cm^-1). So maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then heating with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to some kind of enol ether formation or perhaps a rearrangement. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then maybe the Al is causing ring opening.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone or an ester. Let me think: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation to form a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense because dehydrohalogenation would form alkenes, not ketones. Wait, maybe it's a double elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but I don't see the carbonyl then.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon treatment with KOH, perhaps a double E2 elimination occurs, each Br losing a H to form a double bond. So the product would be 1,3-diene adamantane. But then, the IR would not show a carbonyl, so I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Let's imagine that. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide upon reaction with KOH. How? Because in some cases, vicinal dihalides can form epoxides if treated with a base. Wait, wait, vicinal dihalides (1,2-dihalides) can form epoxides under certain conditions, but 1,3-dibromide isn't vicinal. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide but formed via a different mechanism. Or maybe the product isn't an epoxide but another structure. Let me think again about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde, but that would be higher in ppm. 

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. So the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH produces a carbonyl compound. How? Maybe it's a Fries rearrangement, but that's for aryl esters. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination leading to a conjugated carbonyl. 

Wait, maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to a conjugated diene or a carbonyl. Wait, no, elimination usually gives alkenes, not ketones. Unless there's some kind of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming two alkenes and releasing two HBr molecules. So the product would have two double bonds. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane. If two adjacent Br atoms undergo elimination, forming a cyclopropane ring. But then, would that produce a carbonyl? No, cyclopropane wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? Maybe through a ring-opening of some sort. If the adamantane structure opens up, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, it undergoes two E2 eliminations to form a conjugated diene. But then, where is the carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first step, so perhaps I should try to proceed and see if the later steps give me any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess Al(OiPr)3. Al is a Lewis acid, so perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation or alkylation. If product 1 is a ketone, then Al(OiPr)3 could catalyze a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 would need to have a benzene ring, which adamantane doesn't have. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al is causing ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the Al is inducing some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's think about the integration. 2H, 10H, and 2H. So 14 H in total? Adamantane has 10 H in the rings (each bridge position has two CH2 groups). So product 1 must have more hydrogens. Wait, perhaps product 1 has a CH2O group, which would account for the 2H at 4.79. The 10H in the 2.41-2.23 region could be from bridgehead CH2 groups. So it's possible that product 1 is a ketone, maybe like adamantanedione. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a diketone. If each Br is replaced by an O, but that would require oxidation. Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the elimination forms a ketone through some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination with each Br losing H and forming a double bond, making a diene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So I'm confused. Maybe I should look for other clues.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78Â°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozone is typically used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would cleave each double bond. But depending on the structure, it might form different products. After ozonolysis, adding dimethyl sulfide typically leads to reductive work-up, but sometimes leads to breaking the ozonides into carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show signals from these carbonyl groups, but wait, carbonyls don't show in 1H NMR. Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, in ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved. For example, if product 2 is a diene, like a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups and perhaps some aldehyde or ketone protons, depending on the structure.

So, the most deshielded protons in product 3 would be those adjacent to carbonyl groups. These are typically deshielded and appear as triplets or other coupling patterns depending on their neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis, the original diene is cleaved. Let me think: if product 2 is a diene, say, (CH2)2 groups with a double bond between them, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-diene adamantane, ozonolysis would break each double bond. Wait, but if it's a conjugated diene, ozonolysis at -78Â°C (which is a milder condition) would typically result in the formation of ozonides, which upon work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, not a diene. Because if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 might have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's imagine product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps an enol ether is formed via some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a ketone with a neighboring double bond, making it a conjugated enone.

Wait, another approach: The initial reaction with KOH could be causing a ring-opening of the adamantane structure. But that's probably not the case, as adamantane is very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the product after KOH is a bridged bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, say, 1,3-diketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes a Claisen rearrangement or some pericyclic reaction. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the second step is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but since product 1 doesn't have an aromatic ring, that's probably not it.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me try to think differently. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. Its NMR has a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H) which could be a CH2 attached to an O. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) must be from bridgehead CH2 groups, and 1.94 (2H) perhaps from a CH2 adjacent to something electronegative.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Adamantane with two ketone groups on adjacent carbons. So, the structure would have two carbonyls, each attached to a bridgehead. Then, the NMR would show the bridgehead protons as the 10H in the 2.41-2.23 range. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be from some other group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the product 2. Product 2 is treated with ozone, which suggests it has a double bond. So product 2 must be an alkene. So, the second step, which is heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3, must form an alkene. How does that happen?

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the Al(OiPr)3 is inducing some kind of elimination to form an alkene. For example, if product 1 is a tertiary alcohol, heating with a Lewis acid could lead to the formation of an alkene via an E1 or E2 mechanism. But product 1 is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the Al(OiPr)3 is causing ring-opening to form an alkene. Wait, but if product 1 is an epoxide, the NMR would have peaks for the epoxide protons, which are usually deshielded and appear around 3-4 ppm. But product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is higher, maybe indicating something else.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, but without the O-H stretch in IR, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. The IR at 1720 could be an ester carbonyl. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could induce some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, like an adamantanone ester, then the Al could cause an elimination, producing an alkene and an alcohol, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Al is causing a retro-aldol cleavage or some rearrangement.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so let's move on to the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is ozonolyzed, leading to product 3. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically break each double bond into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds.

But product 3's NMR is what we're interested in. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. In an aldehyde, the H is very deshielded and appears around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But in product 3, the peak isn't that, but perhaps another scenario.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, say, a single double bond somewhere. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps making two ketone or aldehyde groups. Then, the protons adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded.

For example, if product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. So, in product 3, the protons next to the carbonyl (like on a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone) would have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, but the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. So perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually singlets because they're at the end of the chain and have no adjacent protons. But that doesn't fit any of the options given, which are triplet, triplet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for example, a CH2-CO group. The protons on the CH2 would couple with each other (geminal coupling, which is usually not observed because they're equivalent) and with adjacent protons. Wait, but if the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and perhaps another CH2 group, their coupling would be more complex.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 3. If product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Suppose product 2 is a molecule with a double bond and two CH2 groups adjacent to it. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to their respective CH2 groups.

So, product 3 would have a structure like O=C-R, where R is a CH2 group. The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.1-2.3 ppm, perhaps. These protons would couple with each other (as a triplet due to vicinal coupling) and perhaps with other protons nearby.

Wait, but in the case of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would be adjacent to two others: their own geminal (but they are equivalent, so no splitting) and perhaps the neighboring group. Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's protons would couple with each other and with any neighboring groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those protons is coupled to two others. Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a diene, like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyls. But that's a linear molecule, so after cleavage, you'd have two carbonyls at each end. But in a cyclic structure, the cleavage would form two carbonyls connected by a chain.

But product 3's NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls. These CH2 protons would be split into a triplet if each H is coupled with two equivalent H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, for example, if each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups, the protons on each CH2 are adjacent to the carbonyl and to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Wait, but each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's (on the same CH2) and perhaps one on the adjacent CH2. But if the adjacent CH2 is also a CH2 group, then each H would have two neighbors (from their own CH2) and two from the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets or some more complex splitting.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupling with two different sets of H's. For instance, each H on CH2-A is coupling with the two H's on CH2-B. If CH2-A and CH2-B are each a pair of equivalent H's, then each H on CH2-A would couple with two H's on CH2-B. That would lead to a triplet for each H on CH2-A, as each has two neighboring H's on CH2-B.

Wait, but if the coupling is between two equivalent protons on adjacent groups, then each H would be split into a triplet. For example:

Each H on CH2-A is coupled with two H's on CH2-B. Since the two H's on CH2-B are equivalent, each H on CH2-A would see them as a single doublet with coupling constant J. But wait, each H on CH2-A is coupled with two H's on CH2-B. So the splitting would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2).

So each H on CH2-A would be a triplet, because they're coupling with two equivalent H's on CH2-B.

But wait, if the CH2 groups are adjacent and each has two H's, then each H on CH2-A is adjacent to two H's on CH2-B. So the splitting would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

So looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more coupling. If each H on CH2-A is also coupled with their own geminal H and with H's from another group, the pattern could be more complex. But in the case of a simple CH2-CH2 arrangement, each H would only couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in reality, the structure may have more substituents. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. Then each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. Each CH2 has two H's, and each H is coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet. 

But wait, in that case, the coupling would be between each H and two equivalent H's. So each H would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern is a triplet.

So the correct answer would be A) triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and progressing through several steps to form product 3. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3.

### Step 1: Reaction with KOH
1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, which likely results in a double elimination reaction. Each bromine atom is eliminated along with a Î²-hydrogen, forming a conjugated diene (1,3-diene adamantane). The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, which is inconsistent with a diene. Instead, this suggests the formation of a compound with a carbonyl group. The most plausible explanation is that the reaction forms a diketone (1,3-diketone adamantane), where the two carbonyl groups are located on adjacent carbons.

### Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)â
Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)â), a strong Lewis acid. This step likely induces a rearrangement, forming a conjugated enone (product 2). The enone structure contains a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond, which is consistent with the subsequent ozonolysis step.

### Step 3: Ozonolysis
Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) contains carbonyl groups where the double bond was cleaved. The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are those on the CHâ groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

### Step 4: Coupling Pattern in Product 3
The CHâ groups adjacent to carbonyl groups are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl. Each hydrogen on these CHâ groups couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group. This results in a splitting pattern where each hydrogen appears as a **triplet** due to coupling with two equivalent hydrogens.

### Analysis of Options
- **A) Triplet**: This is consistent with the coupling pattern of a hydrogen atom on a CHâ group adjacent to another CHâ group, where each hydrogen is coupled with two equivalent hydrogens.
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This would require coupling with two distinct sets of hydrogens, which is not the case here.
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would require coupling with one hydrogen and two equivalent hydrogens, which is not applicable here.
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling with four equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.

The correct coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
