Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = γSz. The magnetic field was initially along the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. They're saying the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So before anything happens, the spin would align with the field, right? But when the field is turned off momentarily, and then a new field along Y is turned on. So the spin would precess around this new Y-axis.

But wait, when the field is turned off, the particle's spin isn't subject to any magnetic field for an instant. But then the new field in Y is applied. So the system's Hamiltonian changes from being proportional to Sz to being proportional to Sy, since the magnetic field is along Y. Or wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is -mu · B. So when B is along Y, the energy is proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -γ B Sy.

So the system's Hamiltonian changes from H1 (proportional to Sz) to H2 (proportional to Sy). I'm trying to remember about spin precession and oscillations in such cases.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz before the field is changed. Let's say the initial state is |↑z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2. But after the field is changed to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B Sy. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of various components.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu = γ Sz, mu_z = γ <Sz>. So the average <Sz> oscillates, and we need to find the frequency.

So I think this is a problem about time evolution under a Hamiltonian and finding expectation values. The key is to find the time dependence of <Sz> after the Hamiltonian changes.

Let me recall the time evolution. Suppose the initial state is |ψ(0)>. The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>. But wait, what's the form of H here?

H is proportional to Sy: H = γ B Sy (Wait, wait wait. Let me double-check the sign. The energy is -mu · B. So mu is γ Sz, and the field is B in y-direction. So mu · B = γ Sz * B. So H = -gamma B Sz? No, wait, the direction. Oh wait, no: the field is along Y. So mu · B is gamma S_y multiplied by B, since the field is in Y direction. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no, wait: mu is the magnetic moment, which is a vector. So mu = gamma S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the dot product mu · B is gamma S · B. Since B is in Y, B = B_0 \hat{y}. So mu · B = gamma S_y B_0.

So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = -gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the spin operators are in terms of Pauli matrices, right? So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). Let me write that as H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin matrices. The Pauli matrices are:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is |↑z> which is spin up in the z-direction. So in terms of spin matrices, that state is represented as a column vector [1; 0].

When the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, which we can write as H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y, but wait, no: is the sign correct? Because H = - mu · B. So H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the energy levels. The eigenvalues of H would be proportional to ± (gamma B ħ/2), since sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1. So the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2)(+1) = - gamma B ħ/2, and E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2)(-1) = gamma B ħ/2. Wait, wait, no, because H is proportional to sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are (gamma B ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma_y's eigenvalues are ±i? No, wait, no. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for each. So when we have sigma_y, its eigenvalues are ±1, but the eigenvectors are different. So for sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, for sigma_y, they are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |↑z> and |↓z>.

But regardless, the initial state is |↑z>, which can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of H (which are |+y> and |-y>).

So the time evolution will cause the state to precess between these eigenstates, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑z>.

But to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin, we can compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this using the time evolution of the expectation values. The time derivative of <S_z> is given by (1/iħ) <[H, S_z]>.

Wait, but maybe here's another approach. Let me think about the system as a two-level system. The initial state is |↑z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. The Hamiltonian after the field change is H = - gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), as the eigenvalues of H.

The time evolution of the state is a superposition of these two eigenstates, which will cause oscillations in the expectation values.

The state |↑z> can be written as a combination of the eigenstates of H. Let's denote the eigenstates of H as |+y> and |-y>. So |↑z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

But actually, |+y> is (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting, we can write |↑z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me verify. Let me compute |+y> and |-y>.

The eigenstates of sigma_y are |+y> = (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2),
and |-y> = (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2).

So |↑z> can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when the system is in |↑z>, it's an equal superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

Then, under time evolution, each component will evolve with their respective phases. So:

|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑z> = exp(-i H t / ħ) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

But each eigenstate |+y> has energy E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * (-1) ? Wait, no.

Wait, H = - gamma B S_y. S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So the eigenvalues of H would be:

E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (+1) = - gamma B ħ/2,
E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) = + gamma B ħ/2.

So when you exponentiate H, each term picks up a phase factor.

So |+y> evolves as exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t /2 ) |+y>,
and |-y> evolves as exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t /2 ) |-y>.

So |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let's express this back in terms of |↑z> and |↓z>.

We can write:

|ψ(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2) (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply through:

= [ (exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |↑z> + i (exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |↓z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).

Simplify the denominator: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2.

The numerator:

For |↑z>:
exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ. So coefficient is (2 cos(γ B t/2 )) |↑z>.

For |↓z>:
i [exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ)] = i * 2i sinθ = -2 sinθ. So coefficient is (-2 sin(γ B t/2 )) |↓z>.

So overall,

|ψ(t)> = [ (2 cos(γ B t/2 )) |↑z> - 2 sin(γ B t/2 ) |↓z> ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(γ B t/2 ) |↑z> - sin(γ B t/2 ) |↓z>.

So, the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = cos(θ) |↑z> - sin(θ) |↓z>, where θ = γ B t / 2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

S_z is (ħ/2) sigma_z, so sigma_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Compute <S_z>:

= [ cosθ <↑z| - sinθ <↓z| ] [ (ħ/2) sigma_z ] [ cosθ |↑z> - sinθ |↓z> ]

sigma_z |↑z> = |↑z>, sigma_z |↓z> = -|↓z>.

So:

= [ cosθ <↑z| - sinθ <↓z| ] (ħ/2) [ cosθ |↑z> + sinθ |↓z> ]

Because when you apply sigma_z to |↓z>, it becomes -|↓z>, so the term becomes:

sigma_z ( cosθ |↑z> - sinθ |↓z> ) = cosθ |↑z> + sinθ |↓z>.

So,

= (ħ/2) [ cosθ <↑z| cosθ |↑z> + cosθ <↑z| sinθ |↓z> - sinθ <↓z| cosθ |↑z> - sinθ <↓z| sinθ |↓z> ]

But the cross terms are zero because <↑z|↓z> = 0.

So,

= (ħ/2) [ cos²θ <↑z|↑z> + sin²θ <↓z|↓z> ]

= (ħ/2) ( cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.

Wait that can't be right. Because if the expectation value is constant, there's no oscillation. But the question states that the average oscillates. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute <S_z>.

Wait, let me write |ψ(t)> as a vector. Since |↑z> is [1; 0] and |↓z> is [0;1], then:

|ψ(t)> = [ cosθ, -sinθ ]^T, where θ = gamma B t /2.

Then, S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, <S_z> is (ħ/2) [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ] where a and b are the components of |ψ(t)>.

In this case, |a|^2 is cos²θ, |b|^2 is sin²θ.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2)( cos²θ - sin²θ ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

Wait, because cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ). So that's the expectation value.

So, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2θ), where θ = gamma B t/2.

So substituting θ:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

But wait, mu_z = gamma <S_z>, because mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function, but divided by 2pi.

Wait, the function cos(omega t) has frequency omega/(2pi). The argument here is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega/(2pi). So in the expression cos(gamma B t), the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the answer options, none of them have that factor of 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Let me go back. Another approach: the oscillation frequency in such spin precession is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But wait, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. The state we found had <S_z> oscillating as cos(gamma B t), implying an angular frequency of gamma B. So the actual frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B/(2 pi). But the question probably refers to the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency. So the answer would be gamma*B, which is option B.

But let me think again. The time evolution I found gives <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). So the time dependence is cos(omega t), where omega = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B)/(2 pi). But the options don't have 2 pi in any denominator, so perhaps the question is using "frequency" to refer to the angular frequency, not the actual frequency.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B, which would correspond to the angular frequency. Option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.

But wait, the initial approach found that the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the angular frequency is gamma B. So why is this?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the time evolution.

Wait, let's think about the energy levels. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ. So the transition frequency between the two states is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the frequency of oscillations in the expectation values would be gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, the initial calculation using matrix methods gives <S_z> oscillating with angular frequency gamma B. So the frequency of the oscillation is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average. So when they say "what is its oscillation frequency", they probably mean the angular frequency, which is gamma B. So the answer is B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a magnetic field along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   The particle starts in the eigenstate $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ of $S_z$. After the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. In terms of Pauli matrices, $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, so $H = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \sigma_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$. It can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$, which are $| +y \rangle$ and $| -y \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_z \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | +y \rangle + | -y \rangle \right),
   \]
   where $| +y \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle + i | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)$ and $| -y \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle - i | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)$.

   Under time evolution, each eigenstate evolves with a phase factor determined by its energy eigenvalue. The energy eigenvalues of $H$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} | +y \rangle + e^{i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} | -y \rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by $\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle$. Substituting $S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z$ and expressing $| \psi(t) \rangle$ in terms of $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_z \rangle$, the calculation yields:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, where the angular frequency of oscillation is $\omega = \gamma B$. Since the question asks for the oscillation frequency, it refers to the angular frequency, which is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of oscillation is $\gamma B$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.  
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = γSz. The magnetic field was initially along the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. They're saying the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. So before anything happens, the spin would align with the field, right? But when the field is turned off momentarily, and then a new field along Y is turned on. So the spin would precess around this new Y-axis.

But wait, when the field is turned off, the particle's spin isn't subject to any magnetic field for an instant. But then the new field in Y is applied. So the system's Hamiltonian changes from being proportional to Sz to being proportional to Sy, since the magnetic field is along Y. Or wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is -mu · B. So when B is along Y, the energy is proportional to Sy. So the Hamiltonian would be H = -γ B Sy.

So the system's Hamiltonian changes from H1 (proportional to Sz) to H2 (proportional to Sy). I'm trying to remember about spin precession and oscillations in such cases.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz before the field is changed. Let's say the initial state is |↑z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2. But after the field is changed to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B Sy. So the state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of various components.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is mu_z. Since mu = γ Sz, mu_z = γ <Sz>. So the average <Sz> oscillates, and we need to find the frequency.

So I think this is a problem about time evolution under a Hamiltonian and finding expectation values. The key is to find the time dependence of <Sz> after the Hamiltonian changes.

Let me recall the time evolution. Suppose the initial state is |ψ(0)>. The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>. But wait, what's the form of H here?

H is proportional to Sy: H = γ B Sy (Wait, wait wait. Let me double-check the sign. The energy is -mu · B. So mu is γ Sz, and the field is B in y-direction. So mu · B = γ Sz * B. So H = -gamma B Sz? No, wait, the direction. Oh wait, no: the field is along Y. So mu · B is gamma S_y multiplied by B, since the field is in Y direction. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no, wait: mu is the magnetic moment, which is a vector. So mu = gamma S. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the dot product mu · B is gamma S · B. Since B is in Y, B = B_0 \hat{y}. So mu · B = gamma S_y B_0.

So the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = -gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the spin operators are in terms of Pauli matrices, right? So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). Let me write that as H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin matrices. The Pauli matrices are:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is |↑z> which is spin up in the z-direction. So in terms of spin matrices, that state is represented as a column vector [1; 0].

When the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y, which we can write as H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y, but wait, no: is the sign correct? Because H = - mu · B. So H = -gamma B S_y. So S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the energy levels. The eigenvalues of H would be proportional to ± (gamma B ħ/2), since sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1. So the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2)(+1) = - gamma B ħ/2, and E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2)(-1) = gamma B ħ/2. Wait, wait, no, because H is proportional to sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are (gamma B ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvalues of sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma_y's eigenvalues are ±i? No, wait, no. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 for each. So when we have sigma_y, its eigenvalues are ±1, but the eigenvectors are different. So for sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, for sigma_y, they are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |↑z> and |↓z>.

But regardless, the initial state is |↑z>, which can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of H (which are |+y> and |-y>).

So the time evolution will cause the state to precess between these eigenstates, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑z>.

But to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin, we can compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this using the time evolution of the expectation values. The time derivative of <S_z> is given by (1/iħ) <[H, S_z]>.

Wait, but maybe here's another approach. Let me think about the system as a two-level system. The initial state is |↑z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. The Hamiltonian after the field change is H = - gamma B S_y. So the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), as the eigenvalues of H.

The time evolution of the state is a superposition of these two eigenstates, which will cause oscillations in the expectation values.

The state |↑z> can be written as a combination of the eigenstates of H. Let's denote the eigenstates of H as |+y> and |-y>. So |↑z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

But actually, |+y> is (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> is (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2).

So substituting, we can write |↑z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me verify. Let me compute |+y> and |-y>.

The eigenstates of sigma_y are |+y> = (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2),
and |-y> = (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2).

So |↑z> can be expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So when the system is in |↑z>, it's an equal superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

Then, under time evolution, each component will evolve with their respective phases. So:

|ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑z> = exp(-i H t / ħ) [ (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

But each eigenstate |+y> has energy E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) * (-1) ? Wait, no.

Wait, H = - gamma B S_y. S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. So the eigenvalues of H would be:

E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (+1) = - gamma B ħ/2,
E_- = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (-1) = + gamma B ħ/2.

So when you exponentiate H, each term picks up a phase factor.

So |+y> evolves as exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t /2 ) |+y>,
and |-y> evolves as exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B t /2 ) |-y>.

So |ψ(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let's express this back in terms of |↑z> and |↓z>.

We can write:

|ψ(t)> = [ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|↑z> + i |↓z>)/sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t/2) (|↑z> - i |↓z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2).

Multiply through:

= [ (exp(i gamma B t/2) + exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |↑z> + i (exp(i gamma B t/2) - exp(-i gamma B t/2)) |↓z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).

Simplify the denominator: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2.

The numerator:

For |↑z>:
exp(iθ) + exp(-iθ) = 2 cosθ. So coefficient is (2 cos(γ B t/2 )) |↑z>.

For |↓z>:
i [exp(iθ) - exp(-iθ)] = i * 2i sinθ = -2 sinθ. So coefficient is (-2 sin(γ B t/2 )) |↓z>.

So overall,

|ψ(t)> = [ (2 cos(γ B t/2 )) |↑z> - 2 sin(γ B t/2 ) |↓z> ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(γ B t/2 ) |↑z> - sin(γ B t/2 ) |↓z>.

So, the state at time t is |ψ(t)> = cos(θ) |↑z> - sin(θ) |↓z>, where θ = γ B t / 2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

S_z is (ħ/2) sigma_z, so sigma_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Compute <S_z>:

= [ cosθ <↑z| - sinθ <↓z| ] [ (ħ/2) sigma_z ] [ cosθ |↑z> - sinθ |↓z> ]

sigma_z |↑z> = |↑z>, sigma_z |↓z> = -|↓z>.

So:

= [ cosθ <↑z| - sinθ <↓z| ] (ħ/2) [ cosθ |↑z> + sinθ |↓z> ]

Because when you apply sigma_z to |↓z>, it becomes -|↓z>, so the term becomes:

sigma_z ( cosθ |↑z> - sinθ |↓z> ) = cosθ |↑z> + sinθ |↓z>.

So,

= (ħ/2) [ cosθ <↑z| cosθ |↑z> + cosθ <↑z| sinθ |↓z> - sinθ <↓z| cosθ |↑z> - sinθ <↓z| sinθ |↓z> ]

But the cross terms are zero because <↑z|↓z> = 0.

So,

= (ħ/2) [ cos²θ <↑z|↑z> + sin²θ <↓z|↓z> ]

= (ħ/2) ( cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.

Wait that can't be right. Because if the expectation value is constant, there's no oscillation. But the question states that the average oscillates. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute <S_z>.

Wait, let me write |ψ(t)> as a vector. Since |↑z> is [1; 0] and |↓z> is [0;1], then:

|ψ(t)> = [ cosθ, -sinθ ]^T, where θ = gamma B t /2.

Then, S_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, <S_z> is (ħ/2) [ |a|^2 - |b|^2 ] where a and b are the components of |ψ(t)>.

In this case, |a|^2 is cos²θ, |b|^2 is sin²θ.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2)( cos²θ - sin²θ ) = (ħ/2) cos(2θ).

Wait, because cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ). So that's the expectation value.

So, <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(2θ), where θ = gamma B t/2.

So substituting θ:

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

But wait, mu_z = gamma <S_z>, because mu = gamma S. So mu_z = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, but the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z. So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function, but divided by 2pi.

Wait, the function cos(omega t) has frequency omega/(2pi). The argument here is gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega/(2pi). So in the expression cos(gamma B t), the frequency is gamma B/(2 pi).

But looking at the answer options, none of them have that factor of 2 pi. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Let me go back. Another approach: the oscillation frequency in such spin precession is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. But wait, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. The state we found had <S_z> oscillating as cos(gamma B t), implying an angular frequency of gamma B. So the actual frequency (cycles per second) is gamma B/(2 pi). But the question probably refers to the angular frequency as the oscillation frequency. So the answer would be gamma*B, which is option B.

But let me think again. The time evolution I found gives <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). So the time dependence is cos(omega t), where omega = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is omega/(2 pi) = (gamma B)/(2 pi). But the options don't have 2 pi in any denominator, so perhaps the question is using "frequency" to refer to the angular frequency, not the actual frequency.

Looking at the options:

Option B is gamma B, which would correspond to the angular frequency. Option D is gamma B / sqrt(2), etc.

But wait, the initial approach found that the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the angular frequency is gamma B. So why is this?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the time evolution.

Wait, let's think about the energy levels. The energy difference between the two eigenstates is (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ. So the transition frequency between the two states is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B. So the frequency of oscillations in the expectation values would be gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, the initial calculation using matrix methods gives <S_z> oscillating with angular frequency gamma B. So the frequency of the oscillation is gamma B, which is option B.

But wait, the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average. So when they say "what is its oscillation frequency", they probably mean the angular frequency, which is gamma B. So the answer is B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then turned off and replaced with a magnetic field along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   The particle starts in the eigenstate $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ of $S_z$. After the magnetic field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. In terms of Pauli matrices, $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, so $H = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \sigma_y$.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The initial state $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$. It can be expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $H$, which are $| +y \rangle$ and $| -y \rangle$:
   \[
   | \uparrow_z \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | +y \rangle + | -y \rangle \right),
   \]
   where $| +y \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle + i | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)$ and $| -y \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle - i | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)$.

   Under time evolution, each eigenstate evolves with a phase factor determined by its energy eigenvalue. The energy eigenvalues of $H$ are $\pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2}$. Thus, the time-evolved state is:
   \[
   | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} | +y \rangle + e^{i \frac{\gamma B t}{2}} | -y \rangle \right).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is given by $\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle$. Substituting $S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_z$ and expressing $| \psi(t) \rangle$ in terms of $| \uparrow_z \rangle$ and $| \downarrow_z \rangle$, the calculation yields:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, where the angular frequency of oscillation is $\omega = \gamma B$. Since the question asks for the oscillation frequency, it refers to the angular frequency, which is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of oscillation is $\gamma B$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.  
**Answer: B**
