Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Hmm, okay. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has l1 = l2 = 1. 

The problem states that we're ignoring their spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital part here. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So the first two numbers are l1 and l2, each being 1. The third is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L, which is 2, and the fourth is the magnetic quantum number M, which is -1.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait a second, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is L1z and L2z. So when we measure L1z, the possible outcomes are m1 * ħ, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for L2z, it's m2 * ħ. 

So the question is asking, what's the probability that both measurements yield -ħ, which would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the product state would have m_total = m1 + m2 = -2, but wait, the state we have has M = -1. So that’s confusing.

Wait, the current state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the state is a combination of possible m1 and m2 values that add up to M=-1. So for each possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1, the state would have a component in that product state.

But wait, the problem is about the joint probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So their sum would be m1 + m2 = -2. But the total M here is -1. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, does it have any component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1?

Because if it doesn't, then the probability is zero. Let me think.

The state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states that add up to M=-1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs would be (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2), etc., but wait, wait. Wait, m1 can be -1,0,1 and m2 can be -1,0,1. So their sum is M = m1 + m2.

So for M = -1, possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1,

(0, -1) → sum -1,

and is there another? Let me see: if m1=1 and m2=-2? No, because m2 can't be -2 since l2=1, m2 can only be -1,0,1. So the only possibilities are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, if m1 is -1 and m2 is 0, sum is -1. If m1 is 0 and m2 is -1, sum is -1. Also, if m1 is 1 and m2 is -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to M=-1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |L=2, M=-1> must be a linear combination of those two product states.

But wait, wait, in the coupled state |L=2, M=-1>, the state is orthogonal to any states where m1 + m2 != -1. So if I have to find the probability of both m1 =-1 and m2 =-1, that's m1 + m2 = -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Wait, but wait another moment. Am I missing something? The state is a combination of (m1, m2) with sum M=-1. So any (m1, m2) pair that adds to -1. So the only possibilities are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So in this coupled state, the components where m1=-1 and m2=-1 (which sums to -2) are not present. So when measuring, you can't get m1=-1 and m2=-1 in this state.

So the joint probability is zero.

Let me think again. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>.

So, the state |L=2, M=-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0,

m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of these two product states.

So when we measure L1z and L2z, which are the individual m1 and m2 values times ħ, the possible outcomes are m1 and m2 such that they sum to -1.

So the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the state can't have a component where m1=-1 and m2=-1, because that would require sum -2, but M is -1.

Therefore, the probability of both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

So the correct answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ (orbital angular momentum quantum numbers), $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number), and $m = -1$ (magnetic quantum number). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to yield eigenvalues of $-\hbar$.

For a single electron in a p orbital, the possible $m$ values are $-1, 0, +1$. Measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ corresponds to measuring $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, where $m_1, m_2 \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$. The total angular momentum $m$ is given by $m = m_1 + m_2$. In this state, $m = -1$, so the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$  
2. $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

The state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is a linear combination of these two product states. However, the problem asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. This corresponds to $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not satisfy the condition $m = -1$. Therefore, the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ has no component where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

Since the coupled state does not include this combination, the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

So the first two numbers are l1 and l2, each being 1. The third is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L, which is 2, and the fourth is the magnetic quantum number M, which is -1.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait a second, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is L1z and L2z. So when we measure L1z, the possible outcomes are m1 * ħ, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly for L2z, it's m2 * ħ. 

So the question is asking, what's the probability that both measurements yield -ħ, which would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the product state would have m_total = m1 + m2 = -2, but wait, the state we have has M = -1. So that’s confusing.

Wait, the current state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the state is a combination of possible m1 and m2 values that add up to M=-1. So for each possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1, the state would have a component in that product state.

But wait, the problem is about the joint probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So their sum would be m1 + m2 = -2. But the total M here is -1. So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, does it have any component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1?

Because if it doesn't, then the probability is zero. Let me think.

The state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> states that add up to M=-1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs would be (-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2), etc., but wait, wait. Wait, m1 can be -1,0,1 and m2 can be -1,0,1. So their sum is M = m1 + m2.

So for M = -1, possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1,

(0, -1) → sum -1,

and is there another? Let me see: if m1=1 and m2=-2? No, because m2 can't be -2 since l2=1, m2 can only be -1,0,1. So the only possibilities are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, if m1 is -1 and m2 is 0, sum is -1. If m1 is 0 and m2 is -1, sum is -1. Also, if m1 is 1 and m2 is -2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1. So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to M=-1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |L=2, M=-1> must be a linear combination of those two product states.

But wait, wait, in the coupled state |L=2, M=-1>, the state is orthogonal to any states where m1 + m2 != -1. So if I have to find the probability of both m1 =-1 and m2 =-1, that's m1 + m2 = -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't have any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability of measuring m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Wait, but wait another moment. Am I missing something? The state is a combination of (m1, m2) with sum M=-1. So any (m1, m2) pair that adds to -1. So the only possibilities are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So in this coupled state, the components where m1=-1 and m2=-1 (which sums to -2) are not present. So when measuring, you can't get m1=-1 and m2=-1 in this state.

So the joint probability is zero.

Let me think again. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>.

So, the state |L=2, M=-1> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0,

m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of these two product states.

So when we measure L1z and L2z, which are the individual m1 and m2 values times ħ, the possible outcomes are m1 and m2 such that they sum to -1.

So the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the state can't have a component where m1=-1 and m2=-1, because that would require sum -2, but M is -1.

Therefore, the probability of both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

So the correct answer is D) 0.
