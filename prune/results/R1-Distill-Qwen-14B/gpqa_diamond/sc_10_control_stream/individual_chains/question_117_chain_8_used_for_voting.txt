Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question asks which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the compound is not superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So, each of these compounds needs to be checked for the presence of such centers.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, the structure is a biphenyl, which means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2,2' for the carboxylate groups and 6,6' for the nitro groups. I'm trying to visualize this. The central single bond between the two phenyl rings is a possibility for rotation, but wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that they can't freely rotate into a mirror image, then maybe there's a possibility for stereoisomerism. Oh wait, but biphenyls can have restricted rotation if the substituents are bulky. So, could this have any chiral centers?

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene itself doesn't have chiral centers. But wait, the structure is a carboxylate ester. The ester groups are O-C-O. Are there any chiral centers here? The ester group is O connected to a carbonyl and an oxygen connected to another carbon. Let me think about the structure. For the dimethyl ester, the carbonyl is connected to two methyl groups? Wait no, the ester is O-C-O with the carbonyl. So each of these ester groups is on a benzene ring. The substituents are at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. Wait, but each ring's substituents are in such positions that they might create a chiral center. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Wait, but benzene rings are flat; the substituents are in specific positions. But I don't think the biphenyl itself has chiral centers unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the central carbon (if any) is a chiral center. Wait, no, the central bond is between two carbons, but each is part of a benzene ring. So, perhaps the substituents are at positions that could cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Oh, but biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism arising from hindrance to rotation around the central bond. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't rotate to mirror each other, then it's a possibility. But wait, optical isomerism requires the presence of chiral centers, or in some cases, like in allenes, but generally, it's about the arrangement of substituents around a central atom. Oh wait, axial chirality is when the central bond has restricted rotation, leading to different enantiomers. So this structure might have axial chirality. So, the molecule should have optical isomers. So compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoic acid has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is OMe-O-C-O. Wait, the formula is CH3O-COO-CH2CH2OH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HO-CH2-COOH. As an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait: the structure would be O

Wait, more precisely, the ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the acid is CH2(COOH)OH. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. Propanoate would have three carbons: COO- is the first, then a CH2, and then another CH2-OH. Wait, no. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

But as an ester, it's methyl ester, so the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2-OH? Wait, no, the ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but is there a chiral center here? Let's look at the molecule: the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (OH), the two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3. So, the carbon with OH is attached to: a COOCH3 group, two CH2 (one leading to another CH2 and the other perhaps leading to the ester), and an OH. Wait, let me see. The structure is: HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is the second carbon. So, the groups attached to it are: a hydroxyl (OH), two CH2 groups, and a carbonyl group (from the COOCH3). Wait, no, wait: the structure is more accurately:

O
||
COOCH3 is connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2, which has an OH. So, the chain is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but the central carbons are the two CH2 groups. The one with the hydroxyl is the second CH2. So, that carbon is CH2 connected to OH, which would have the structure: CH2-OH is attached to a CH2 which is attached to the COOCH3. So, the carbon with the OH would have two CH2 groups (one from the COOCH3 and one leading to the OH), an OH, and a hydrogen? Wait, no: each CH2 is a -CH2- group. So, the carbon with the OH is CH2OH, which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, to clarify, the structure is:

COOCH3 – CH2 – CH2 – OH

So, the two CH2 groups are adjacent. The carbon next to the COOCH3 is the first CH2, and the next is the second CH2 with the OH.

So, the second CH2 (with OH) is attached to:

- One CH2 (leading to COOCH3)
- One CH2 (leading to the OH)
- And two hydrogens?

Wait, no, each CH2 has two hydrogens. Wait, perhaps I should number them.

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group.
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.
Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which means the propanoate is the conjugate base of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH2) has the groups: COOCH3, CH2OH, and two hydrogens?

Wait, wait, no. Let me write the structure again:

The propanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The carbon chain is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 3, CH2 on carbon 2, and a CH2OH on carbon 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, looking at the carbon in the middle (the one with the OH), it's attached to:

- COOCH3 (a carbonyl group)
- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- OH
- and another CH (but wait, that's the same as the adjacent CH3?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: CH3
2: C(OH)
3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure is:

The propanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, three carbons in total in the acid part. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OMe.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2 (from the COOCH3)
- another CH2 (from the other side)
- and a hydrogen? Or no?

Wait, the second carbon in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3: it's a CH2 group. So the groups are:

- One CH2 connected to the COOCH3 group
- Another CH2 connected to the OH group
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, because the CH2 would have two CH2 groups, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the structure.

The molecule is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2(OH).

So, each CH2 is connected to the next. The central CH2 is attached to:

- One CH2 which is attached to COOCH3
- Another CH2 which is attached to OH
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So, the central carbon (the one in the middle CH2) is connected to four different groups: COOCH3, OH (from the adjacent CH2?), no, wait, the central carbon is the CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2OH.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3 (C3) connected to CH2 (C2) connected to CH2OH (C1).

So, C2 is the central carbon. It's connected to:

- C3 (COOCH3)
- C1 (CH2OH)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, but wait, if C2 has two CH2 groups, then the groups are:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

Wait, but that's only two different groups and two H's, so it's not a chiral center. Wait, no, because each CH2 is a single bond. So, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

So, the central CH2 is between COOCH3 and CH2OH. So, the groups attached to the central CH2 are:

- COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

So, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. Wait, but that's two H's and two other groups, so the central carbon can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So, no chiral centers here. Therefore, compound 2 does not exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another possibility is that the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- COOCH3 (from the other side)
- OH
- and another CH (but perhaps it's CH2? Or another carbon?)

Wait, in that case, the central carbon would have groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (maybe CH2?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center. Oh wait, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center because both substituents are CH2. So, no. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (bearing OH) would have:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another group. Wait, what's the other group? Oh, perhaps it's a CH2 elsewhere. No, wait, that might not fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomerism. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is the molecule symmetrical? If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two CH2 groups. So, mirror plane would make it achiral, so no optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and the adjacent CH (maybe a CH2 group?)

Wait, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH group (from the adjacent CH). Wait, but that would only give three different groups (CH3, COOCH3, OH) and one more group which is CH? Or perhaps two groups are the same, making it not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is attached to four different groups, making it chiral. So, in that case, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think I should proceed. Let's tentatively say that compound 2 has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So, its structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, with two phenyl groups attached. So, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon has two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the double bond). Wait, no, wait. The central carbon in benzophenone is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group (O double-bonded), and a single bond to another oxygen? No, wait, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen. So, what's the fourth group? Oh, wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon only has three bonds: two to phenyl and one double bond to oxygen. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the structure of benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, a double bond to oxygen, and a single bond to another phenyl? No, wait, that's not correct. Benzophenone has a central carbon connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group (O=C-). So, how? Wait, the structure is:

Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where Ar is phenyl.

So, the central carbon is bonded to two Ar groups and a carbonyl group (O double bond). Wait, but that only makes three bonds. Oh, wait, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon has three bonds: two to Ar and one double bond to O. So, the central carbon has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to Ar groups, but that leaves only three bonds. Wait, but carbon has four bonds. So, I must be missing something. Oh, wait, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be. Wait, no, benzophenone is (1,1-diphenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–CH₂–Ph? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is a ketone, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, that means the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, but how does that work? Oh, wait, maybe it's a single carbon with two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl (O double bond), and a hydrogen. No, because in that case, the formula would be Ph–CO–Ph with a hydrogen. But benzophenone doesn't have a hydrogen; it's a ketone with two phenyl groups. So, the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar. Therefore, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. But that would leave only three bonds, which is impossible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a double bond O, and another single bond. Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C–(O)–Ph, with the central C being double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to two Ph groups. But that's not possible because the central carbon would have three bonds, unless there's a fourth. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CO–Ph, where the central C is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to the two Ph groups. But that would require the central C to have only three bonds, which is impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the structure is Ph–C(=O)–CH2–Ph. No, that would be diphenyl ketone with an ethyl group, but benzophenone is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So, perhaps the central C is part of a larger structure. Wait, perhaps I should accept that benzophenone has a structure where the central C is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and perhaps a hydrogen. But that would be a ketone, which has the structure R-CO-R'. So, in benzophenone, R and R' are both phenyl. So, the structure is Ph–CO–Ph. So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a hydrogen. But wait, that would give a formula of C13H10O, which is correct. So, the central C has four substituents: two phenyl groups, a carbonyl (O double bond), and a H.

Wait, but in a carbonyl group, the central C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two R groups. So, in benzophenone, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and no H. Wait, that can't be, because that would require the C to have only three bonds. So, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–CO–Ph, where the C is connected to two phenyl groups and the O. But that leaves only three bonds, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back to this.

So, benzophenone—does it have any chiral centers? Let's think. If the central C is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, but no, that would require three bonds. Unless there's a hydrogen. So, if it's Ph–C(O)–Ph with a hydrogen, then the central C is attached to Ph, Ph, O (double bond), and H. Then, that would be four substituents. But wait, a carbonyl group is a double bond, so the C=O is a double bond, which counts as one substituent, but the C is still bonded to the two Ph groups and the H. So, in that case, the central C would have four substituents: two Ph, one H, and a double bond O. But wait, in terms of hybridization, that would be sp² hybridized. So, it's trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, meaning it can't be a chiral center. Because chiral centers must be tetrahedral. So, even if the central carbon had four substituents, if it's sp² hybridized, it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. The fumarate ester would be the di-ester, so OMe groups instead of the hydroxyls. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–(COOCH3)CH₂.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons, and the substituents are on opposite sides.

Dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, so each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–(COOCH3)CH₂. Or more accurately, it's O

But wait, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, the correct structure of fumarate is:

COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3, with the two substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration).

So, the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's think about the central carbons. The central two carbons are double-bonded (C=C). Each of these carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group. Are these carbons chiral centers?

Each of the carbons in the double bond (the CH groups) is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen. So, each CH would have substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. So, that's three substituents, which are not four. So, they're not chiral centers. But wait, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, but fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. But when you make the di-ester, does it have any chiral centers? Wait, no, because in the di-ester, the central carbons are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen, making them not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond if the substituents are on opposite sides. So, for dimethyl fumarate (the trans di-ester), the structure is symmetric. So, it's a meso compound, which is achiral. Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. When you esterify both acid groups to form dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure would be: 

COOCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3    O
||           ||
C=C
||           ||
O-C-OCH3    O

But arranged in a trans configuration. So, each C of the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached, and the two groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetric, which means it's a meso compound. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism because it's achiral. But wait, wait, no—dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

No, because the central carbons are each bonded to two COOCH3 groups and perhaps a hydrogen. For example, each central C is connected to:

- COOCH3
- another COOCH3 (wait, no, each C is connected to one COOCH3)
Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure:

The structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that can't be because fumarate is a 1,2-dioic acid. So, the structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H, but in the trans configuration. No, wait, no, but fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond, but wait, each would have:

- One COOCH3 group
- One double bond
- And two H's.

No, that's not right. Let's think again. The structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but that's for the cis isomer (maleate). Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with the double bond. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 → that's maleate (cis). Fumarate is COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3 (trans).

So, each of the central carbons in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- Two H's
- And a double bond.

Wait, that's not correct because each carbon in the double bond would have four bonds. So, each carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, but a double bond counts as two bonds, so each carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond to the adjacent C.

So, each of these carbons (the ones in the double bond) has four substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and double bond to the other C. But since the double bond is a single substituent (the other C as part of the double bond), each C is attached to three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent, but in this case, it's a single substituent). Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the molecule.

In dimethyl fumarate, each double-bonded C is attached to a COOCH3 group, two H's, and the double bond. So, each of these C's has the same substituents: two H's, one COOCH3, and a double bond. So, these are not chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Fumarate is an E isomer, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I thought that fumarate could have diastereomerism but not optical isomerism. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, it's a trans di-ester, which is a meso compound and thus not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another point. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, reviewing each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I think this has axial chirality, so it exhibits optical isomerism. So, yes.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier confusion: if the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, it would be chiral. Let me re-examine. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (with OH) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH (from CH2?)

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then the central CH2 is attached to:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

So, two substituents (CH2COOCH3 and CH2OH) and two H's. So, not four different groups. So, not a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there is a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C3H6O3.

But what about the structure? Let me think of it as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- COOCH3 (from the adjacent COOCH3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, so the groups are:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different substituents. Oh! So, yes, that would make the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the structure is CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So, compound 2 does have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → No, because 4 doesn't.
B) 3,4 → No.
C) 2,3 → No.
D) 1 and 2 → Yes.

So, the correct answer should be option A if 4 is included, but according to the analysis, 4 doesn't. Wait, no, because 4 is a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, only 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, no, in the initial analysis, I thought 1 had axial chirality, which would make it chiral. So, 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but some sources say that biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can exhibit axial chirality, leading to enantiomers. So, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it has optical isomerism.

So, in compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' (on the benzene rings), and at 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. So, the arrangement could be such that the molecule is chiral. Therefore, 1 exhibits optical isomerism. Compound 2, as we determined, does as well.

So, the correct answer is option A if 4 is included, but our analysis says 4 doesn't. Wait, no, let me recheck 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. It's a meso compound because the substituents on each end are mirror images. So, it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. So, only compounds 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality, which are necessary for optical isomerism.

---

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2,2' (carboxylate groups) and 6,6' (nitro groups). The restricted rotation around the central bond due to bulky substituents creates **axial chirality**, meaning the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is **CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃**. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (OH) is attached to four different groups:  
- A methyl group (CH₃)  
- An ester group (COOCH₃)  
- A hydrogen atom (H)  
- The hydroxyl group (OH).  

This makes it a **chiral center**, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure **Ph–C(=O)–Ph**, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon in the carbonyl group is **sp² hybridized** and trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, so it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the **trans (E)** di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure **COOCH₃–CH=CH–COOCH₃**. The double bond between the two carbons ensures that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and the presence of a chiral center, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question asks which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the compound is not superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. So, each of these compounds needs to be checked for the presence of such centers.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, the structure is a biphenyl, which means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2,2' for the carboxylate groups and 6,6' for the nitro groups. I'm trying to visualize this. The central single bond between the two phenyl rings is a possibility for rotation, but wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that they can't freely rotate into a mirror image, then maybe there's a possibility for stereoisomerism. Oh wait, but biphenyls can have restricted rotation if the substituents are bulky. So, could this have any chiral centers?

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene itself doesn't have chiral centers. But wait, the structure is a carboxylate ester. The ester groups are O-C-O. Are there any chiral centers here? The ester group is O connected to a carbonyl and an oxygen connected to another carbon. Let me think about the structure. For the dimethyl ester, the carbonyl is connected to two methyl groups? Wait no, the ester is O-C-O with the carbonyl. So each of these ester groups is on a benzene ring. The substituents are at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. Wait, but each ring's substituents are in such positions that they might create a chiral center. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Wait, but benzene rings are flat; the substituents are in specific positions. But I don't think the biphenyl itself has chiral centers unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the central carbon (if any) is a chiral center. Wait, no, the central bond is between two carbons, but each is part of a benzene ring. So, perhaps the substituents are at positions that could cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Oh, but biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a type of stereoisomerism arising from hindrance to rotation around the central bond. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't rotate to mirror each other, then it's a possibility. But wait, optical isomerism requires the presence of chiral centers, or in some cases, like in allenes, but generally, it's about the arrangement of substituents around a central atom. Oh wait, axial chirality is when the central bond has restricted rotation, leading to different enantiomers. So this structure might have axial chirality. So, the molecule should have optical isomers. So compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoic acid has three carbons. The ester is methyl, so the structure is OMe-O-C-O. Wait, the formula is CH3O-COO-CH2CH2OH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HO-CH2-COOH. As an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH. Wait, no, wait: the structure would be O

Wait, more precisely, the ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the acid is CH2(COOH)OH. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH? No, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. Propanoate would have three carbons: COO- is the first, then a CH2, and then another CH2-OH. Wait, no. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

But as an ester, it's methyl ester, so the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2CH2-OH? Wait, no, the ester would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but is there a chiral center here? Let's look at the molecule: the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (OH), the two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3. So, the carbon with OH is attached to: a COOCH3 group, two CH2 (one leading to another CH2 and the other perhaps leading to the ester), and an OH. Wait, let me see. The structure is: HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the one with the OH) is the second carbon. So, the groups attached to it are: a hydroxyl (OH), two CH2 groups, and a carbonyl group (from the COOCH3). Wait, no, wait: the structure is more accurately:

O
||
COOCH3 is connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH2, which has an OH. So, the chain is COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, but the central carbons are the two CH2 groups. The one with the hydroxyl is the second CH2. So, that carbon is CH2 connected to OH, which would have the structure: CH2-OH is attached to a CH2 which is attached to the COOCH3. So, the carbon with the OH would have two CH2 groups (one from the COOCH3 and one leading to the OH), an OH, and a hydrogen? Wait, no: each CH2 is a -CH2- group. So, the carbon with the OH is CH2OH, which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, to clarify, the structure is:

COOCH3 – CH2 – CH2 – OH

So, the two CH2 groups are adjacent. The carbon next to the COOCH3 is the first CH2, and the next is the second CH2 with the OH.

So, the second CH2 (with OH) is attached to:

- One CH2 (leading to COOCH3)
- One CH2 (leading to the OH)
- And two hydrogens?

Wait, no, each CH2 has two hydrogens. Wait, perhaps I should number them.

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group.
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.
Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which means the propanoate is the conjugate base of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH2) has the groups: COOCH3, CH2OH, and two hydrogens?

Wait, wait, no. Let me write the structure again:

The propanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The carbon chain is:

COOCH3 is on carbon 3, CH2 on carbon 2, and a CH2OH on carbon 1.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, looking at the carbon in the middle (the one with the OH), it's attached to:

- COOCH3 (a carbonyl group)
- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- OH
- and another CH (but wait, that's the same as the adjacent CH3?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

1: CH3
2: C(OH)
3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure is:

The propanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, three carbons in total in the acid part. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the ester is formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OMe.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2 (from the COOCH3)
- another CH2 (from the other side)
- and a hydrogen? Or no?

Wait, the second carbon in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3: it's a CH2 group. So the groups are:

- One CH2 connected to the COOCH3 group
- Another CH2 connected to the OH group
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, because the CH2 would have two CH2 groups, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the structure.

The molecule is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2(OH).

So, each CH2 is connected to the next. The central CH2 is attached to:

- One CH2 which is attached to COOCH3
- Another CH2 which is attached to OH
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So, the central carbon (the one in the middle CH2) is connected to four different groups: COOCH3, OH (from the adjacent CH2?), no, wait, the central carbon is the CH2 between COOCH3 and CH2OH.

Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3 (C3) connected to CH2 (C2) connected to CH2OH (C1).

So, C2 is the central carbon. It's connected to:

- C3 (COOCH3)
- C1 (CH2OH)
- Two hydrogens.

Wait, but wait, if C2 has two CH2 groups, then the groups are:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

Wait, but that's only two different groups and two H's, so it's not a chiral center. Wait, no, because each CH2 is a single bond. So, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

So, the central CH2 is between COOCH3 and CH2OH. So, the groups attached to the central CH2 are:

- COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

So, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. Wait, but that's two H's and two other groups, so the central carbon can't be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. So, no chiral centers here. Therefore, compound 2 does not exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, another possibility is that the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one attached to OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- COOCH3 (from the other side)
- OH
- and another CH (but perhaps it's CH2? Or another carbon?)

Wait, in that case, the central carbon would have groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH (maybe CH2?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center. Oh wait, if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH2, which isn't a chiral center because both substituents are CH2. So, no. But if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (bearing OH) would have:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another group. Wait, what's the other group? Oh, perhaps it's a CH2 elsewhere. No, wait, that might not fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomerism. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is the molecule symmetrical? If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two CH2 groups. So, mirror plane would make it achiral, so no optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and the adjacent CH (maybe a CH2 group?)

Wait, if it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH group (from the adjacent CH). Wait, but that would only give three different groups (CH3, COOCH3, OH) and one more group which is CH? Or perhaps two groups are the same, making it not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is attached to four different groups, making it chiral. So, in that case, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think I should proceed. Let's tentatively say that compound 2 has a chiral center, so it does exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So, its structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, with two phenyl groups attached. So, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon has two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the double bond). Wait, no, wait. The central carbon in benzophenone is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group (O double-bonded), and a single bond to another oxygen? No, wait, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen. So, what's the fourth group? Oh, wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon only has three bonds: two to phenyl and one double bond to oxygen. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the structure of benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, a double bond to oxygen, and a single bond to another phenyl? No, wait, that's not correct. Benzophenone has a central carbon connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group (O=C-). So, how? Wait, the structure is:

Ar–C(=O)–Ar, where Ar is phenyl.

So, the central carbon is bonded to two Ar groups and a carbonyl group (O double bond). Wait, but that only makes three bonds. Oh, wait, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon has three bonds: two to Ar and one double bond to O. So, the central carbon has a double bond to O, and two single bonds to Ar groups, but that leaves only three bonds. Wait, but carbon has four bonds. So, I must be missing something. Oh, wait, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So, the central carbon has two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and a hydrogen? No, that can't be. Wait, no, benzophenone is (1,1-diphenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–CH₂–Ph? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is a ketone, so the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Wait, that means the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, but how does that work? Oh, wait, maybe it's a single carbon with two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl (O double bond), and a hydrogen. No, because in that case, the formula would be Ph–CO–Ph with a hydrogen. But benzophenone doesn't have a hydrogen; it's a ketone with two phenyl groups. So, the structure is Ar–C(=O)–Ar. Therefore, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. But that would leave only three bonds, which is impossible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, a double bond O, and another single bond. Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C–(O)–Ph, with the central C being double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to two Ph groups. But that's not possible because the central carbon would have three bonds, unless there's a fourth. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is Ph–CO–Ph, where the central C is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to the two Ph groups. But that would require the central C to have only three bonds, which is impossible. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the structure is Ph–C(=O)–CH2–Ph. No, that would be diphenyl ketone with an ethyl group, but benzophenone is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So, perhaps the central C is part of a larger structure. Wait, perhaps I should accept that benzophenone has a structure where the central C is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and perhaps a hydrogen. But that would be a ketone, which has the structure R-CO-R'. So, in benzophenone, R and R' are both phenyl. So, the structure is Ph–CO–Ph. So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a hydrogen. But wait, that would give a formula of C13H10O, which is correct. So, the central C has four substituents: two phenyl groups, a carbonyl (O double bond), and a H.

Wait, but in a carbonyl group, the central C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two R groups. So, in benzophenone, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So, the central C is bonded to two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and no H. Wait, that can't be, because that would require the C to have only three bonds. So, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–CO–Ph, where the C is connected to two phenyl groups and the O. But that leaves only three bonds, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back to this.

So, benzophenone—does it have any chiral centers? Let's think. If the central C is attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, but no, that would require three bonds. Unless there's a hydrogen. So, if it's Ph–C(O)–Ph with a hydrogen, then the central C is attached to Ph, Ph, O (double bond), and H. Then, that would be four substituents. But wait, a carbonyl group is a double bond, so the C=O is a double bond, which counts as one substituent, but the C is still bonded to the two Ph groups and the H. So, in that case, the central C would have four substituents: two Ph, one H, and a double bond O. But wait, in terms of hybridization, that would be sp² hybridized. So, it's trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, meaning it can't be a chiral center. Because chiral centers must be tetrahedral. So, even if the central carbon had four substituents, if it's sp² hybridized, it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HO₂CCH=CHCO₂H. The fumarate ester would be the di-ester, so OMe groups instead of the hydroxyls. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–(COOCH3)CH₂.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the second and third carbons, and the substituents are on opposite sides.

Dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester, so each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–(COOCH3)CH₂. Or more accurately, it's O

But wait, the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, the correct structure of fumarate is:

COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3, with the two substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration).

So, the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's think about the central carbons. The central two carbons are double-bonded (C=C). Each of these carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group. Are these carbons chiral centers?

Each of the carbons in the double bond (the CH groups) is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and perhaps a hydrogen. So, each CH would have substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. So, that's three substituents, which are not four. So, they're not chiral centers. But wait, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, but fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. But when you make the di-ester, does it have any chiral centers? Wait, no, because in the di-ester, the central carbons are each attached to two COOCH3 groups and a hydrogen, making them not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the double bond if the substituents are on opposite sides. So, for dimethyl fumarate (the trans di-ester), the structure is symmetric. So, it's a meso compound, which is achiral. Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me clarify. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. When you esterify both acid groups to form dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure would be: 

COOCH3
|
CH₂–C=C–CH₂
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3    O
||           ||
C=C
||           ||
O-C-OCH3    O

But arranged in a trans configuration. So, each C of the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached, and the two groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetric, which means it's a meso compound. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism because it's achiral. But wait, wait, no—dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

No, because the central carbons are each bonded to two COOCH3 groups and perhaps a hydrogen. For example, each central C is connected to:

- COOCH3
- another COOCH3 (wait, no, each C is connected to one COOCH3)
Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure:

The structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–CH₂(COOCH3)

Wait, no, that can't be because fumarate is a 1,2-dioic acid. So, the structure is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H, but in the trans configuration. No, wait, no, but fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)–CH=CH–COOCH3.

Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond, but wait, each would have:

- One COOCH3 group
- One double bond
- And two H's.

No, that's not right. Let's think again. The structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3, but that's for the cis isomer (maleate). Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 with the double bond. No, wait, fumarate has a double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, the correct structure is:

COOCH3–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 → that's maleate (cis). Fumarate is COOCH3–CH=CH–COOCH3 (trans).

So, each of the central carbons in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- Two H's
- And a double bond.

Wait, that's not correct because each carbon in the double bond would have four bonds. So, each carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, but a double bond counts as two bonds, so each carbon in the double bond has:

- COOCH3
- Two H's
- And a double bond to the adjacent C.

So, each of these carbons (the ones in the double bond) has four substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and double bond to the other C. But since the double bond is a single substituent (the other C as part of the double bond), each C is attached to three substituents: COOCH3, H, H, and the double bond (which is a substituent, but in this case, it's a single substituent). Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should imagine the molecule.

In dimethyl fumarate, each double-bonded C is attached to a COOCH3 group, two H's, and the double bond. So, each of these C's has the same substituents: two H's, one COOCH3, and a double bond. So, these are not chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Fumarate is an E isomer, meaning the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I thought that fumarate could have diastereomerism but not optical isomerism. So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, it's a trans di-ester, which is a meso compound and thus not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another point. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, reviewing each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I think this has axial chirality, so it exhibits optical isomerism. So, yes.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier confusion: if the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, it would be chiral. Let me re-examine. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (with OH) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH (from CH2?)

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then the central CH2 is attached to:

- CH2COOCH3
- CH2OH
- Two H's.

So, two substituents (CH2COOCH3 and CH2OH) and two H's. So, not four different groups. So, not a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there is a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C3H6O3.

But what about the structure? Let me think of it as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH)
- COOCH3 (from the adjacent COOCH3)
- OH
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, so the groups are:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- H.

So, four different substituents. Oh! So, yes, that would make the central carbon a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the structure is CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So, compound 2 does have optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, so no optical isomerism.

So, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → No, because 4 doesn't.
B) 3,4 → No.
C) 2,3 → No.
D) 1 and 2 → Yes.

So, the correct answer should be option A if 4 is included, but according to the analysis, 4 doesn't. Wait, no, because 4 is a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, only 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, no, in the initial analysis, I thought 1 had axial chirality, which would make it chiral. So, 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but some sources say that biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can exhibit axial chirality, leading to enantiomers. So, if the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, then it has optical isomerism.

So, in compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' (on the benzene rings), and at 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. So, the arrangement could be such that the molecule is chiral. Therefore, 1 exhibits optical isomerism. Compound 2, as we determined, does as well.

So, the correct answer is option A if 4 is included, but our analysis says 4 doesn't. Wait, no, let me recheck 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. It's a meso compound because the substituents on each end are mirror images. So, it's achiral and doesn't have optical isomerism. So, only compounds 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2. So, the correct answer is D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality, which are necessary for optical isomerism.

### Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2,2' (carboxylate groups) and 6,6' (nitro groups). The restricted rotation around the central bond due to bulky substituents creates **axial chirality**, meaning the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of this compound is **CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃**. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (OH) is attached to four different groups:  
- A methyl group (CH₃)  
- An ester group (COOCH₃)  
- A hydrogen atom (H)  
- The hydroxyl group (OH).  

This makes it a **chiral center**, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### Compound 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure **Ph–C(=O)–Ph**, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon in the carbonyl group is **sp² hybridized** and trigonal planar, not tetrahedral, so it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the **trans (E)** di-ester of fumaric acid, with the structure **COOCH₃–CH=CH–COOCH₃**. The double bond between the two carbons ensures that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion  
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality and the presence of a chiral center, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not exhibit optical isomerism.
