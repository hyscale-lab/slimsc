Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So the first part is finding the relative speed between them. I think the formula for relative velocity u' when one frame (say, astronaut A's frame) is moving at velocity u relative to another frame (astronaut B's frame) is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Or wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at v relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at u relative to the lab frame, then the speed of B as seen from A's frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in this case, I think astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. Wait, no, wait, wait. The problem says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So from the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, wait: both are moving in the same direction, right? So from the lab frame, both are going in the positive x-direction. So if I'm in the lab frame, A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) ). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no, no—when considering relative velocity, if both are going in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. So let me plug in the numbers. So u is 0.5c (B's speed) and v is 0.6c (A's speed). So relative speed u' would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5-0.6 is -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c. But since we're talking about speed, perhaps the magnitude? Wait, no, because if you take the absolute value, but wait, in relativity, the formula accounts for direction. Since B is moving slower than A in the same direction, from A's frame, B would be moving backward? Oh wait no, because if B is moving at 0.5c in the lab frame, and A is moving at 0.6c, then from A's frame, B is actually moving backward if A is moving faster. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So numerator: -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but speed is positive. So the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. So each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². But wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So for each, their rest energy is 2m c² and 3m c², but their kinetic energy would be (gamma -1) times that. But wait, wait—the problem says "total energy of the system." So I think that would be the sum of their individual rest energies plus their kinetic energies. Or wait, no, wait: in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. So for each astronaut, their total energy is gamma * m_total * c².

Wait, let's clarify. Each astronaut's rest mass is given as 2m and 3m. So for the first, 2m, moving at 0.6c. The gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, v=0.6c): gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait no, wait. Wait, the calculation: gamma is 1.25. So the energy is gamma * (mass) * c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no, wait: 1.25 multiplied by 2m c² is 2.5 mc². Okay.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, v=0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.464 m c².

So total energy of the system is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, so approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options:

Option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That matches.

Option D says v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc². So that's not matching.

Option B: v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96. No, our relative speed was about 0.14c.

Wait, but wait, when calculating relative speed, I took the relative speed as (0.5c-0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)c²/c²) )= (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So in the options, C and D have v_rel=0.14c.

So E is about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

But wait, let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. Because sometimes the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So if I'm in the frame of A, which is moving at v=0.6c relative to the lab, then the velocity of B in A's frame is (u’= (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) ), where u is B's speed in lab frame (0.5c), and v is A's speed (0.6c). So (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative velocity and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Velocity
The relative velocity \( u' \) of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \),
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

This matches **Option C**, which states \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and \( E = 5.96m c^2 \).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the calculation: gamma is 1.25. So the energy is gamma * (mass) * c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no, wait: 1.25 multiplied by 2m c² is 2.5 mc². Okay.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

### Relative Velocity
The relative velocity \( u' \) of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A's frame is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[

\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame),

Substituting the values:

\[

\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \),

This matches **Option C**, which states \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and \( E = 5.96m c^2 \).
