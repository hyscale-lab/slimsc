Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with different r exponents.

Hmm, wait. Parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax (plx) in parsecs is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance, right? Or more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem says N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N = k * (d)^5. Oh wait, because 1/(1/d) is d. So (1/plx) is d, so (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, not N as a function of d, but the change in N as d increases. That is, the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d, I think.

So, dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to d. Since N is proportional to d^5, the derivative is 5 d^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in d, how much does N increase? The rate of change is dN/dd. So, dN/dd = 5 d^4. So, the number per unit distance (like per parsec) increases as d^4.

So, the change in N per unit r (distance) is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes the density of stars isn't just N per unit volume, but maybe it's per unit distance in some way. Hmmm. Oh, wait, maybe I should think about how the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would vary.

The number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness (dr) multiplied by the number density. But wait, in this case, the number density (stars per unit volume) might be varying with distance. So, if N is the number of stars per unit volume, then N ∝ d^5. Wait, that can't be right because volume is r^3, but perhaps the number density is something else.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about N as the number of stars in a region. The number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N = k * d^5. Now, if I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume of the shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = (k * d^5) * (4πd² dr) )? Wait, no, that can't be right because that would give N_shell proportional to d^7 dr, which would suggest that the number increases rapidly, but that doesn't match the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial statement. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, perhaps the number N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, which is d^5. So N = k d^5.

But if I want the number of stars per unit distance, it's the derivative dN/dd. So dN/dd = 5 k d^4. So per unit distance, the number increases as r^4. So the correct option is C: ~r^4.

So the answer should be option C.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \):  
\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]  
Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, not N as a function of d, but the change in N as d increases. That is, the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d, I think.

So, dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to d. Since N is proportional to d^5, the derivative is 5 d^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So for each unit increase in d, how much does N increase? The rate of change is dN/dd. So, dN/dd = 5 d^4. So, the number per unit distance (like per parsec) increases as d^4.

So, the change in N per unit r (distance) is proportional to r^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the answer should be option C.
