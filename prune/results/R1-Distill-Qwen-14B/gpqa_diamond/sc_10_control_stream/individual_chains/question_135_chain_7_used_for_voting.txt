Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation here, but I think it's a Yukawa-like interaction. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, so the problem is asking which fermions the boson X can decay into. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The key here is to determine which fermions have a mass less than or equal to half the mass of X, because in pair production, each particle must be at most half the mass of the parent particle (since energy and momentum must allow for both particles).

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. Let me remember the masses of the known fermions.

Quarks: The masses are up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quark is way heavier, like around 173 GeV. So that's way too heavy. So top quarks are out.

Other fermions: charged leptons include electrons, muons, taus. The tau is about 1.78 GeV. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me check: the electron is about 0.511 MeV, muon about 105.7 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The strange quark mass is around 100 MeV, charm is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, but wait, bottom is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

So let me list the possible fermions:

- electrons (e)
- muons (μ)
- taus (τ)
- u quarks (u)
- d quarks (d)
- s quarks (s)
- c quarks (c)

Wait, but the c quark (charm) is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV.

But what about the bottom quark? 4.5 GeV, which is higher than 3 GeV, so X can't decay into b quarks.

So X can decay into c quarks, s, u, d, and the leptons e, μ, τ.

Wait, let me list each fermion and their approximate masses:

- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV → way under 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV → under.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → under 3 GeV.
- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (current algebra gives around 1.5-3 MeV, but it's light).
- Down quark (d): ~3-5 MeV → very light.
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV → under.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV → under.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV → over 3 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, so no.

So the possible fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the lepton masses are so small that the condition is easily satisfied. So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Looking back at the options, let me see.

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. Wait no, because b is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So c is allowed because c's mass is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. Also, tau is under 3 GeV. So this option includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so this can't be right.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. No, because b is too heavy.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the allowed decays. So the correct pairs are all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But what about the order? Let me check the options.

Option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all except top, b is not included, which is correct.

Wait, but looking again, the problem says the interaction is between X and fermions f. The Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Wait, the interaction term is L = -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. So the coupling is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So any fermion that's part of this interaction is allowed to decay. But the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions are included in the interaction. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the fermions f are those that are part of the interaction.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions f are present. So perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions, or only some. Wait, in the given Lagrangian, f is possibly an index for all fermions, but in reality, perhaps X only interacts with certain fermions, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, but the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So perhaps X can interact with any fermion, so any fermion that has mass ≤3 GeV would be allowed to decay from X.

Thus, the possible decay products are all fermion-antifermion pairs where each fermion has m ≤ 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the tau has a mass of 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so it's allowed.

So the possible decay channels are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, all of these are allowed. So option B is X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But wait, wait. Let me check the masses again. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3, so yes. So option B is correct.

Wait, but option B says X→ c cbar etc. So does that mean that the decay into c cbar is allowed? Yes, because each c is 1.5 GeV, so two would be 3 GeV, which is exactly the mass of X. So that's allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, what about the option D? Option D includes b, which isn't allowed, so D is out. Option A includes b, which is no. Option C includes t, which is a no. So the correct option is B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays are governed by the interaction term in the Lagrangian, which implies that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with masses \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). Therefore, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs: \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \).

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark mass (\( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)) exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark mass (\( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) far exceeds \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. This option is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B

So let me list the possible fermions:

Option A: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. Wait no, because b is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So c is allowed because c's mass is about 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. Also, tau is under 3 GeV. So this option includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Option C: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, t tbar, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so this can't be right.

Option D: X→ b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. No, because b is too heavy.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the allowed decays. So the correct pairs are all fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Looking at the options:

Wait, but option B says X→ c cbar etc. So does that mean that the decay into c cbar is allowed? Yes, because each c is 1.5 GeV, so two would be 3 GeV, which is exactly the mass of X. So that's allowed.
