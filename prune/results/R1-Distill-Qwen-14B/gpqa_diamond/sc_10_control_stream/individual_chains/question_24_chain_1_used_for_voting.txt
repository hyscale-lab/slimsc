Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a mixture X that's equimolar and consists of two liquids. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X's compounds.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double or triple bonds, as alkenes or alkynes can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, mixture X has compounds that can add bromine, meaning they have unsaturated bonds.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is a mixture Y which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's compounds don't have double or triple bonds. But wait, the reaction with platinum under heat—what kind of reaction is that? Platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so maybe X is undergoing hydrogenation or some addition reaction.

But wait, the problem says that after treatment, Y is formed via disproportionation. Disproportionation means a single species is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some redox reactions, like O turning into O^2- and O^2. Wait, but here, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction, leading to two products each, forming two components in Y.

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. X is a mixture of two liquids. After treatment with Pt and heat, Y is formed, which is also a mixture of two liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so those compounds must be saturated—no double or triple bonds.

Hydrogenation of X gives Z, and hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, end up as the same hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be a more saturated compound than both X and Y, but wait—what's the deal with Y not decolorizing bromine water? Because Y's compounds don't have double bonds, so they are already saturated. But when hydrogenated, they might add more hydrogen or something else.

Wait, but the problem says that both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So perhaps X and Y are different dienes or something that when hydrogenated give the same product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that when hydrogenated give Z, and Y is a mixture of their hydrogenation products. But since Y doesn't react with bromine, it's already saturated.

Wait, no. Because if X has unsaturated compounds, hydrogenation would add H2, making them saturated. So Y's compounds are perhaps dihydro derivatives but already saturated.

But let's try to think of possible candidates for Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So let's calculate the molecular formula.

Hydrocarbon Z: Let's assume it's CnHm.

The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136 n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136/0.8572) n ≈ 2n

So m is approximately 2n. Wait, but 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.

So m ≈ 2n.

Wait, but for a hydrocarbon, the formula is usually CnH2n (alkene), CnH2n+2 (alkane), or CnH2n-6 (like benzene rings, but benzene is C6H6, which is m=6, n=6: m=6, 2n=12, so 6 is less than 12. Hmm, maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, in our case, m ≈ 2n. So for a general formula, perhaps it's CnH2n. That would be an alkene. But wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps Z is an alkane, which is more hydrogenated. Hmm, but the calculation suggests that the hydrogen percentage is lower, which is typical for more hydrogenated (saturated) compounds.

Wait, let me compute this again.

Assume Z is CH2 groups. Let me find the formula.

Suppose Z is CnHm.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

So:

m / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428

Cross multiply:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428 m

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136n

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) * n ≈ 2n

So m ≈ 2n.

Which would give the formula CnH2n. That's an alkene. But wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps Z is more saturated. Wait, but perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, like cyclohexane, which is C6H12. But wait, for cyclohexane, m=12, n=6 → m=2n. So it fits.

Wait, let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane. C=12, H=1.

Cyclohexane: C6H12.

Molar mass: 6*12 +12*1 =72+12=84 g/mol.

Hydrogen's mass is 12 g/mol. So fraction is 12/84 = 0.142857, which is roughly 14.28%. Exactly matches the data. So Z is cyclohexane.

So Z is C6H12.

Wait, but wait. Cyclohexane is C6H12, right. So m=12, n=6.

So, m=2n. So that fits, and hydrogen fraction is 12/(72+12)=12/84=1/7≈14.28%.

So Z is cyclohexane.

Now, Z is a constituent of Y. So Y must contain cyclohexane and another component that, when hydrogenated, also gives cyclohexane. But wait, no, because when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So Y's components, when hydrogenated, become Z.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids. So both components in Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. That implies that both components in Y, when hydrogenated, produce the same Z. How is that possible?

Ah, perhaps they are geometric isomers of each other. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, which is a single product. But wait, cyclohexane is a single structure. So maybe the components in Y are dihydro derivatives of something else.

Wait, perhaps Y consists of two diastereomers or something that, upon hydrogenation, gives the same product. Alternatively, maybe Y's components are dienes that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds, so perhaps Y's components are cyclohexene and something else. Wait, cyclohexene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but Y is the product after X undergoes a reaction. X is the starting mixture. Let's think about the reaction.

X is treated with Pt and heated. It undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, what kind of reaction would cause X to form Y via disproportionation?

Disproportionation usually involves a single substance undergoing both oxidation and reduction. But X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction, leading to two products in Y. Or maybe each component is split into two, but that's not clear.

Wait, maybe X consists of two alkenes, each of which undergoes hydrogenation upon reaction with Pt, but that would just be hydrogenation. But the problem says that the reaction is a disproportionation, which is a redox process. So perhaps it's not hydrogenation but some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Oh, wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z.

Wait, but hydrogenation is a reaction with H2 and a catalyst. So perhaps the reaction in the presence of Pt and heat is something else, like isomerization or maybe a dehydrohalogenation or addition.

Alternatively, maybe X's components are di-substituted alkenes that, upon heating with Pt, undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the steps again.

1. X is a mixture of two liquids. They decolorize bromine, so they have double bonds.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components are saturated.

3. Hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane (from earlier analysis).

So, if X is a mixture of alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane, what could X be?

Wait, but hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2, turning them into alkanes. If X's hydrogenation gives Z, which is cyclohexane, then X's components must be alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So, what alkenes hydrogenate to cyclohexane? Probably cyclohexene, but wait, cyclohexene's hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two alkenes. Each would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, both of which hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is the only alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Unless there are other alkenes that are isomers of cyclohexene.

Wait, cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond. Are there other structures that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane? Well, perhaps if there are substituents, but the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes that are not conjugated. Wait, but when hydrogenated, they give cyclohexane. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because dienes would need two H2 additions.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that are isomers of each other, both of which hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, for example, cis-cyclohexene and trans-cyclohexene. But those are the same compound, just geometric isomers. Or perhaps different alkenes like 1,3-cyclohexadiene and something else. Wait, but 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So X's compounds can't have conjugated double bonds.

So perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. Then, each of those alkenes would have to be cyclohexene, but perhaps in different structures. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: since Y is a product of X's disproportionation, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when heated with Pt, undergo a reaction that breaks the double bonds into single bonds. So, maybe each component in X has a double bond that is broken, and the products are alkanes.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, hold on. If X is a mixture of alkenes, and Y is a mixture of alkanes from their hydrogenation. But when Y is hydrogenated, what happens? Alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. Wait, but the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are not alkanes but perhaps something else.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. X has two liquids, unsaturated (decolorizes Br2). So two alkenes or alkynes.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y, which doesn't decolorize Br2. So Y's components are saturated.

3. Hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclohexane). So X's components, when hydrogenated, become cyclohexane.

4. Hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So Y's components, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane.

But wait, if Y is a mixture of alkanes, adding H2 under Pt won't do anything because alkanes are already saturated. So unless Y's components are something else that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps Y's components are dihydro derivatives, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, could Y's components be something like cyclohexene, which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane? But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which cyclohexene would. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So Y can't have cyclohexene because that would still decolorize Br2.

Wait, maybe Y's components are something else. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, say, 1,3-pentadiene and another, but wait, the problem says no conjugated double bonds in X's components. So perhaps each component in X is a mono-alkene, not conjugated.

But that leads me back to earlier confusion. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different di-substituted alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But then each would have to be cyclohexene, which is the same. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But how? Unless they're isomers of cyclohexene.

Wait, cyclohexene is a single structure. Maybe there are other alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, if we have a bridged bicyclic compound or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane. So each of them would be cyclohexene derivatives, but I can't think of another structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which has a double bond in a position that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclohexane. For example, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethene and something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the hydrogenation of Y giving Z. Since Z is cyclohexane, which is an alkane, Y must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y is already saturated. So the only way Y can hydrogenate is if Y has triple bonds or something else. But if Y is an alkane, it won't react with H2. So perhaps Y is a triple bond or an aromatic compound. Wait, but aromatic compounds are usually deactivating and may not react under normal hydrogenation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Y's components are cyclohexane itself and another alkane. But then hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are cyclohexane and another compound that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what Z is. Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. So, when X is hydrogenated, each component in X adds H2 to become cyclohexane. So, each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. So, perhaps each component in X is cyclohexene. But that would mean X is a pure substance, but X is a mixture of two liquids.

Wait, so maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes which, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. But for that, each diene would have to add two H2 molecules to become cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which is part of a ring. For example, cyclohexene and another cyclic alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two mono-alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. So, each alkene is a six-carbon compound with a double bond. For example, consider 1,2-dichloroethene, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different mono-alkenes that are six-carbon, each with a double bond in such a position that hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So, for a mono-alkene to hydrogenate to cyclohexane, the starting material must be cyclohexene. So, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another cyclohexene isomer. But cyclohexene is a single compound; the only isomer is the cis and trans forms, which are the same in terms of structure—so that wouldn't make two different components. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a double bond that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any other alkenes that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane besides cyclohexene.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the hydrogenation of X and Y giving Z. So X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product, Z, which is cyclohexane. So Y must be a mixture of two other compounds that, when hydrogenated, also give cyclohexane. But Y's components don't have double bonds, so what could they be?

Wait, perhaps Y's components are dihydro derivatives, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are cyclohexane and another alkane, but that can't be because hydrogenation of alkanes doesn't produce anything.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes, each of which is a derivative that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are alkenes that are more substituted than cyclohexene. But wait, Y's components don't decolorize bromine, so they can't have double bonds. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe Y's components are cyclohexane and another cycloalkane, but that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the initial reaction: X treated with Pt and heat gives Y via disproportionation. So X's components undergo disproportionation.

Disproportionation in the context of alkenes—wait, but alkenes are reduced in hydrogenation, not sure about disproportionation. Oh, wait, maybe X's components are something else, like alcohols or something else that can disproportionate.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine, so they must have double bonds. So perhaps they are alkenes.

Wait, in the case of an alkene, the only way I know of a disproportionation would be something like the breakdown of an alkene into smaller alkenes or alkanes, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are undergoing a reaction where they add across the double bond in a way that affects the structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogens, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of a cyclic alkene. For example, cyclohexene treated with Pt and heat could undergo ring-opening to form something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are dienes, but that would have conjugated bonds, which the problem states are not present in X's compounds.

Wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. So, X's components are mono-alkenes or isolated dienes, but not conjugated.

So, let's think again. X is a mixture of two mono-alkenes with non-conjugated double bonds. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo some isomerization or addition.

But the result is Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. So perhaps, in the presence of Pt and heat, the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to alkanes in Y. But wait, that would be hydrogenation, not a disproportionation.

Wait, but the problem states that the reaction is a disproportionation. So perhaps the alkenes are undergoing some kind of redox reaction, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, but when alkenes react with H2 and Pt, it's hydrogenation, not a disproportionation. So maybe the reaction in the problem isn't hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt when heated, which suggests a catalyst for a reaction. But what reaction would cause alkenes to form alkanes via disproportionation?

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but something else that can disproportionate.

Wait, but X's components must have double bonds because they decolorize bromine.

Wait, maybe X's components are dihydroxy compounds, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's unlikely without halogens.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are undergoing some kind of cleavage, but that would produce smaller molecules, not necessarily alkanes.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the fact that Z is cyclohexane. So, when X is hydrogenated, each component adds H2 to become cyclohexane. So, each component in X must be a cycloalkene. Because cyclohexene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of two cycloalkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but how? Because each cycloalkene would have to be cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any alkenes besides cyclohexene that would do that.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclohexene and another di-substituted alkene, but I can't think of another. Maybe it's a mono-substituted cycloalkene and a trans-cyclohexene? But in that case, the hydrogenation would still give cyclohexane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which hydrogenates to cyclohexane, then perhaps X contains cyclohexene and another structure that upon hydrogenation also gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure what that structure would be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the components in X are ene structures that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. For example, maybe 1,3-cyclopentadiene, but that's a conjugated diene, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, each with a double bond in a six-carbon structure. For example, perhaps one is 1,2-dichloroethene, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, such as 1,2-dichloroethene and another, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a different mono-alkene with a different structure but same formula as cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is the only six-carbon mono-alkene that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are cyclohexene and another di-substituted alkene with a different structure but same number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with a six-carbon chain, but not cyclic. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene. But when hydrogenated, they would become hexane, not cyclohexane. So that can’t be.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of what Y could be. Y is formed via the disproportionation of X, and Y's components don't have double bonds. When Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, if Y's components are alkanes, how do they give cyclohexane upon hydrogenation? That doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal circumstances. So perhaps Y's components are something else that can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane. Maybe Y's components are benzene rings? No, because benzene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but benzene would decolorize bromine, which it doesn't in Y. So Y can't have benzene.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. So how do they hydrogenate to cyclohexane? That doesn't make sense. Unless Y's components are alkenes, but that would mean Y's components would decolorize bromine, which they don't.

Wait, maybe I've made a wrong assumption. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via disproportionation. So, perhaps this isn't hydrogenation but a different reaction. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, or maybe it's an isomerization, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but that would produce alkenes, which Y doesn't have.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without a halogen, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction, but that would require a protic group, which I don't know if X has.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y, which is also a mixture of two liquids via disproportionation. So, perhaps the reaction is a redox reaction where each component in X is both oxidized and reduced.

But if X is a mixture of alkenes, perhaps they are being broken down or rearranged.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the double bond. For example, heating an alkene with Pt could cause it to cleave into two smaller alkanes. But then, Y would consist of two alkanes, which when hydrogenated, would not change. So that doesn't fit with Y's hydrogenation giving Z.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation followed by something else, but the problem says it's a disproportionation.

This is getting really tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the total number of H atoms in mixture X. The options are 12, 16, 18, 22.

Since X is a mixture of two liquids, each with a certain number of H atoms, I need to find the sum of H in both.

Each component in X is an alkene (because they decolorize bromine), and when hydrogenated, they form Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). So each component in X, after adding H2, becomes C6H12.

So, each component in X must be C6H10, because adding two H2 molecules would give C6H12.

Wait, because hydrogenation is adding H2 across the double bond. So, each alkene in X must be C6H10.

But wait, C6H10 is a mono-alkene. For example, cyclohexene is C6H10.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the number of H in each component of X. Each is C6H10, so 10 H per molecule.

But X is a mixture of two such components, so each contributes 10 H. So total H in X would be 10 + 10 = 20? But looking at the options, 22 is an option (C). Hmm, but 20 isn't an option. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different C6H10 alkenes. So each has 10 H, so total of 20 H in X. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, but with varying structures. But each would have the same formula, C6H10.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a mono-alkene and a di-alkene. But wait, the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so dienes would have to be isolated.

Wait, if X is a mixture of a mono-alkene and a di-alkene, each without conjugation, but each would have a different number of H.

For example, a mono-alkene is CnH2n, and a di-alkene is CnH2n-2.

But if each upon hydrogenation gives Z, which is C6H12, perhaps each component in X has the formula C6H10.

Wait, let's think: if a compound has the formula C6H10, after adding two H2 molecules (i.e., 4 H atoms), it becomes C6H14? No, wait, no. Wait, Z is C6H12. So each component in X must have two H less than Z. So if Z is C6H12, X's components are C6H10.

Because adding two H's (from one H2) would give C6H12, but wait, no. Wait, no: hydrogenation adds H2 across each double bond. For a mono-alkene, adding one H2 would take it from C6H10 to C6H12.

So each component in X is C6H10, and each, upon hydrogenation, gives C6H12.

So, each component in X has 10 H atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such components, the total H atoms would be 10 + 10 = 20. But none of the options is 20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each component isn't C6H10. Let me think again.

If Z is C6H12, then each component in X must, after hydrogenation, form Z. So, for a mono-alkene, each must have the formula C6H10. Because adding one H2 (two H atoms) would make it C6H12.

Wait, but if a component is a di-alkene (two double bonds), then each would need two H2 additions to become C6H12. So, the starting material would be C6H8.

But the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so the di-alkene would have to be isolated. But it's possible.

So, X could be a mixture of a mono-alkene (C6H10) and a di-alkene (C6H8).

Each upon hydrogenation would give C6H12.

So, for the mono-alkene: H count is 10 per molecule.

For the di-alkene: H count is 8 per molecule.

So, in X, which is a 1:1 mixture of two components, each with 10 and 8 H respectively.

Total H in X would be (10 + 8) = 18. So total H is 18. Which is option B.

Wait, that matches one of the options. Let me check.

Each component in X would be:

Component A: C6H10 → 10 H.

Component B: C6H8 → 8 H.

So, equimolar mixture (1 mole each), total H is 10 + 8 = 18.

Which is option B) 18.

So this seems to fit.

Now, let's think about Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction of X. So, each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction.

Disproportionation of an alkene—how? Well, perhaps one of the alkenes is being oxidized and reduced. But alkenes typically undergo addition reactions, not redox.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a disproportionation reaction, like breaking into smaller alkanes and alkenes. For example, maybe the alkene is breaking into a smaller alkene and a larger alkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without halogens, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps each alkene in X is being converted into a diol, but that wouldn't explain the formation of Y as a mixture of alkanes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the cyclic alkenes. For example, cyclohexene upon heating with Pt could ring-open into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation, but in a way that produces a mixture of alkanes and alkenes. But that doesn't fit with Y not having double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but that would produce more alkenes, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but the calculation for the hydrogen count seems to fit. So, if each component in X is C6H10 and C6H8, the total H in mixture X would be 18, which is option B.

The problem involves a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes). When treated with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y's components are saturated (alkanes). Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z, a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), as its hydrogen mass fraction matches the given value.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:  
   Since both X and Y hydrogenate to form Z (C₆H₁₂), the components of X must be unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) that add hydrogen to become cyclohexane. Similarly, the components of Y must be saturated compounds (alkanes) that do not react with hydrogen but are derived from X via disproportionation.

2. **Components of X**:  
   X is a mixture of two liquids with unsaturated bonds. Based on the hydrogenation reaction, the components of X are likely mono-alkenes or di-alkenes. For simplicity, assume X contains one mono-alkene (C₆H₁₀) and one di-alkene (C₆H₈). Each of these components has no conjugated double bonds, as stated in the problem.

3. **Hydrogen Count in X**:  
   - The mono-alkene (C₆H₁₀) contains 10 hydrogen atoms.  
   - The di-alkene (C₆H₈) contains 8 hydrogen atoms.  
   Since X is an equimolar mixture of these two components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:  
   \[
   10 + 8 = 18
   \]

4. **Verification of Y**:  
   Y is formed via disproportionation of X. The components of Y are likely saturated compounds (alkanes) that do not decolorize bromine water. These components could be derived from the breakdown or rearrangement of the unsaturated components of X.

5. **Consistency with Z**:  
   Both X and Y hydrogenate to form Z (C₆H₁₂), confirming that the components of X and Y are consistent with the reaction pathway described.

### Conclusion:
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a mixture X that's equimolar and consists of two liquids. Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. The problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X's compounds.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double or triple bonds, as alkenes or alkynes can undergo addition reactions with bromine. So, mixture X has compounds that can add bromine, meaning they have unsaturated bonds.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is a mixture Y which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's compounds don't have double or triple bonds. But wait, the reaction with platinum under heat—what kind of reaction is that? Platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so maybe X is undergoing hydrogenation or some addition reaction.

But wait, the problem says that after treatment, Y is formed via disproportionation. Disproportionation means a single species is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some redox reactions, like O turning into O^2- and O^2. Wait, but here, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction, leading to two products each, forming two components in Y.

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. X is a mixture of two liquids. After treatment with Pt and heat, Y is formed, which is also a mixture of two liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so those compounds must be saturated—no double or triple bonds.

Hydrogenation of X gives Z, and hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, end up as the same hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be a more saturated compound than both X and Y, but wait—what's the deal with Y not decolorizing bromine water? Because Y's compounds don't have double bonds, so they are already saturated. But when hydrogenated, they might add more hydrogen or something else.

Wait, but the problem says that both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So perhaps X and Y are different dienes or something that when hydrogenated give the same product.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that when hydrogenated give Z, and Y is a mixture of their hydrogenation products. But since Y doesn't react with bromine, it's already saturated.

Wait, no. Because if X has unsaturated compounds, hydrogenation would add H2, making them saturated. So Y's compounds are perhaps dihydro derivatives but already saturated.

But let's try to think of possible candidates for Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So let's calculate the molecular formula.

Hydrocarbon Z: Let's assume it's CnHm.

The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides: m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136 n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136/0.8572) n ≈ 2n

So m is approximately 2n. Wait, but 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2.

So m ≈ 2n.

Wait, but for a hydrocarbon, the formula is usually CnH2n (alkene), CnH2n+2 (alkane), or CnH2n-6 (like benzene rings, but benzene is C6H6, which is m=6, n=6: m=6, 2n=12, so 6 is less than 12. Hmm, maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, in our case, m ≈ 2n. So for a general formula, perhaps it's CnH2n. That would be an alkene. But wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps Z is an alkane, which is more hydrogenated. Hmm, but the calculation suggests that the hydrogen percentage is lower, which is typical for more hydrogenated (saturated) compounds.

Wait, let me compute this again.

Assume Z is CH2 groups. Let me find the formula.

Suppose Z is CnHm.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

So:

m / (12n + m) ) = 0.1428

Cross multiply:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428 m

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n

0.8572 m = 1.7136n

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572 ) * n ≈ 2n

So m ≈ 2n.

Which would give the formula CnH2n. That's an alkene. But wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, perhaps Z is more saturated. Wait, but perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, like cyclohexane, which is C6H12. But wait, for cyclohexane, m=12, n=6 → m=2n. So it fits.

Wait, let's check the mass fraction for cyclohexane. C=12, H=1.

Cyclohexane: C6H12.

Molar mass: 6*12 +12*1 =72+12=84 g/mol.

Hydrogen's mass is 12 g/mol. So fraction is 12/84 = 0.142857, which is roughly 14.28%. Exactly matches the data. So Z is cyclohexane.

So Z is C6H12.

Wait, but wait. Cyclohexane is C6H12, right. So m=12, n=6.

So, m=2n. So that fits, and hydrogen fraction is 12/(72+12)=12/84=1/7≈14.28%.

So Z is cyclohexane.

Now, Z is a constituent of Y. So Y must contain cyclohexane and another component that, when hydrogenated, also gives cyclohexane. But wait, no, because when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So Y's components, when hydrogenated, become Z.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids. So both components in Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. That implies that both components in Y, when hydrogenated, produce the same Z. How is that possible?

Ah, perhaps they are geometric isomers of each other. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, which is a single product. But wait, cyclohexane is a single structure. So maybe the components in Y are dihydro derivatives of something else.

Wait, perhaps Y consists of two diastereomers or something that, upon hydrogenation, gives the same product. Alternatively, maybe Y's components are dienes that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds, so perhaps Y's components are cyclohexene and something else. Wait, cyclohexene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but Y is the product after X undergoes a reaction. X is the starting mixture. Let's think about the reaction.

X is treated with Pt and heated. It undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. So, what kind of reaction would cause X to form Y via disproportionation?

Disproportionation usually involves a single substance undergoing both oxidation and reduction. But X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each of the two components in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction, leading to two products in Y. Or maybe each component is split into two, but that's not clear.

Wait, maybe X consists of two alkenes, each of which undergoes hydrogenation upon reaction with Pt, but that would just be hydrogenation. But the problem says that the reaction is a disproportionation, which is a redox process. So perhaps it's not hydrogenation but some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Oh, wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z.

Wait, but hydrogenation is a reaction with H2 and a catalyst. So perhaps the reaction in the presence of Pt and heat is something else, like isomerization or maybe a dehydrohalogenation or addition.

Alternatively, maybe X's components are di-substituted alkenes that, upon heating with Pt, undergo some rearrangement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the steps again.

1. X is a mixture of two liquids. They decolorize bromine, so they have double bonds.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components are saturated.

3. Hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane (from earlier analysis).

So, if X is a mixture of alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane, what could X be?

Wait, but hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2, turning them into alkanes. If X's hydrogenation gives Z, which is cyclohexane, then X's components must be alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. So, what alkenes hydrogenate to cyclohexane? Probably cyclohexene, but wait, cyclohexene's hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two alkenes. Each would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, both of which hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is the only alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Unless there are other alkenes that are isomers of cyclohexene.

Wait, cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond. Are there other structures that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane? Well, perhaps if there are substituents, but the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes that are not conjugated. Wait, but when hydrogenated, they give cyclohexane. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because dienes would need two H2 additions.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes that are isomers of each other, both of which hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, for example, cis-cyclohexene and trans-cyclohexene. But those are the same compound, just geometric isomers. Or perhaps different alkenes like 1,3-cyclohexadiene and something else. Wait, but 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So X's compounds can't have conjugated double bonds.

So perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane. Then, each of those alkenes would have to be cyclohexene, but perhaps in different structures. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: since Y is a product of X's disproportionation, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when heated with Pt, undergo a reaction that breaks the double bonds into single bonds. So, maybe each component in X has a double bond that is broken, and the products are alkanes.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, hold on. If X is a mixture of alkenes, and Y is a mixture of alkanes from their hydrogenation. But when Y is hydrogenated, what happens? Alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. Wait, but the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are not alkanes but perhaps something else.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. X has two liquids, unsaturated (decolorizes Br2). So two alkenes or alkynes.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y, which doesn't decolorize Br2. So Y's components are saturated.

3. Hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclohexane). So X's components, when hydrogenated, become cyclohexane.

4. Hydrogenation of Y also gives Z. So Y's components, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane.

But wait, if Y is a mixture of alkanes, adding H2 under Pt won't do anything because alkanes are already saturated. So unless Y's components are something else that can be hydrogenated.

Wait, perhaps Y's components are dihydro derivatives, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, could Y's components be something like cyclohexene, which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane? But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which cyclohexene would. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So Y can't have cyclohexene because that would still decolorize Br2.

Wait, maybe Y's components are something else. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, say, 1,3-pentadiene and another, but wait, the problem says no conjugated double bonds in X's components. So perhaps each component in X is a mono-alkene, not conjugated.

But that leads me back to earlier confusion. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different di-substituted alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But then each would have to be cyclohexene, which is the same. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But how? Unless they're isomers of cyclohexene.

Wait, cyclohexene is a single structure. Maybe there are other alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, if we have a bridged bicyclic compound or something else, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane. So each of them would be cyclohexene derivatives, but I can't think of another structure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which has a double bond in a position that, upon hydrogenation, forms cyclohexane. For example, perhaps X is a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethene and something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the hydrogenation of Y giving Z. Since Z is cyclohexane, which is an alkane, Y must be a compound that can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y is already saturated. So the only way Y can hydrogenate is if Y has triple bonds or something else. But if Y is an alkane, it won't react with H2. So perhaps Y is a triple bond or an aromatic compound. Wait, but aromatic compounds are usually deactivating and may not react under normal hydrogenation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Y's components are cyclohexane itself and another alkane. But then hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are cyclohexane and another compound that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what Z is. Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12. So, when X is hydrogenated, each component in X adds H2 to become cyclohexane. So, each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. So, perhaps each component in X is cyclohexene. But that would mean X is a pure substance, but X is a mixture of two liquids.

Wait, so maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes which, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. But for that, each diene would have to add two H2 molecules to become cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which is part of a ring. For example, cyclohexene and another cyclic alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two mono-alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. So, each alkene is a six-carbon compound with a double bond. For example, consider 1,2-dichloroethene, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different mono-alkenes that are six-carbon, each with a double bond in such a position that hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So, for a mono-alkene to hydrogenate to cyclohexane, the starting material must be cyclohexene. So, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another cyclohexene isomer. But cyclohexene is a single compound; the only isomer is the cis and trans forms, which are the same in terms of structure—so that wouldn't make two different components. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with a double bond that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any other alkenes that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane besides cyclohexene.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the hydrogenation of X and Y giving Z. So X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product, Z, which is cyclohexane. So Y must be a mixture of two other compounds that, when hydrogenated, also give cyclohexane. But Y's components don't have double bonds, so what could they be?

Wait, perhaps Y's components are dihydro derivatives, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are cyclohexane and another alkane, but that can't be because hydrogenation of alkanes doesn't produce anything.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of two alkanes, each of which is a derivative that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps Y's components are alkenes that are more substituted than cyclohexene. But wait, Y's components don't decolorize bromine, so they can't have double bonds. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe Y's components are cyclohexane and another cycloalkane, but that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the initial reaction: X treated with Pt and heat gives Y via disproportionation. So X's components undergo disproportionation.

Disproportionation in the context of alkenes—wait, but alkenes are reduced in hydrogenation, not sure about disproportionation. Oh, wait, maybe X's components are something else, like alcohols or something else that can disproportionate.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine, so they must have double bonds. So perhaps they are alkenes.

Wait, in the case of an alkene, the only way I know of a disproportionation would be something like the breakdown of an alkene into smaller alkenes or alkanes, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are undergoing a reaction where they add across the double bond in a way that affects the structure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but without any halogens, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of a cyclic alkene. For example, cyclohexene treated with Pt and heat could undergo ring-opening to form something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X's components are dienes, but that would have conjugated bonds, which the problem states are not present in X's compounds.

Wait, the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. So, X's components are mono-alkenes or isolated dienes, but not conjugated.

So, let's think again. X is a mixture of two mono-alkenes with non-conjugated double bonds. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo some isomerization or addition.

But the result is Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. So perhaps, in the presence of Pt and heat, the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to alkanes in Y. But wait, that would be hydrogenation, not a disproportionation.

Wait, but the problem states that the reaction is a disproportionation. So perhaps the alkenes are undergoing some kind of redox reaction, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, but when alkenes react with H2 and Pt, it's hydrogenation, not a disproportionation. So maybe the reaction in the problem isn't hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt when heated, which suggests a catalyst for a reaction. But what reaction would cause alkenes to form alkanes via disproportionation?

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but something else that can disproportionate.

Wait, but X's components must have double bonds because they decolorize bromine.

Wait, maybe X's components are dihydroxy compounds, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's unlikely without halogens.

Alternatively, maybe the alkenes are undergoing some kind of cleavage, but that would produce smaller molecules, not necessarily alkanes.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the fact that Z is cyclohexane. So, when X is hydrogenated, each component adds H2 to become cyclohexane. So, each component in X must be a cycloalkene. Because cyclohexene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of two cycloalkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but how? Because each cycloalkene would have to be cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any alkenes besides cyclohexene that would do that.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclohexene and another di-substituted alkene, but I can't think of another. Maybe it's a mono-substituted cycloalkene and a trans-cyclohexene? But in that case, the hydrogenation would still give cyclohexane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which hydrogenates to cyclohexane, then perhaps X contains cyclohexene and another structure that upon hydrogenation also gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure what that structure would be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the components in X are ene structures that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. For example, maybe 1,3-cyclopentadiene, but that's a conjugated diene, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, each with a double bond in a six-carbon structure. For example, perhaps one is 1,2-dichloroethene, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, such as 1,2-dichloroethene and another, but I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a different mono-alkene with a different structure but same formula as cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is the only six-carbon mono-alkene that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are cyclohexene and another di-substituted alkene with a different structure but same number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with a six-carbon chain, but not cyclic. For example, 1-hexene and 3-hexene. But when hydrogenated, they would become hexane, not cyclohexane. So that can’t be.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of what Y could be. Y is formed via the disproportionation of X, and Y's components don't have double bonds. When Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, if Y's components are alkanes, how do they give cyclohexane upon hydrogenation? That doesn't make sense because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal circumstances. So perhaps Y's components are something else that can be hydrogenated to form cyclohexane. Maybe Y's components are benzene rings? No, because benzene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, but benzene would decolorize bromine, which it doesn't in Y. So Y can't have benzene.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's components are alkanes. So how do they hydrogenate to cyclohexane? That doesn't make sense. Unless Y's components are alkenes, but that would mean Y's components would decolorize bromine, which they don't.

Wait, maybe I've made a wrong assumption. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed via disproportionation. So, perhaps this isn't hydrogenation but a different reaction. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, or maybe it's an isomerization, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but that would produce alkenes, which Y doesn't have.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without a halogen, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction, but that would require a protic group, which I don't know if X has.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y, which is also a mixture of two liquids via disproportionation. So, perhaps the reaction is a redox reaction where each component in X is both oxidized and reduced.

But if X is a mixture of alkenes, perhaps they are being broken down or rearranged.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the double bond. For example, heating an alkene with Pt could cause it to cleave into two smaller alkanes. But then, Y would consist of two alkanes, which when hydrogenated, would not change. So that doesn't fit with Y's hydrogenation giving Z.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation followed by something else, but the problem says it's a disproportionation.

This is getting really tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the total number of H atoms in mixture X. The options are 12, 16, 18, 22.

Since X is a mixture of two liquids, each with a certain number of H atoms, I need to find the sum of H in both.

Each component in X is an alkene (because they decolorize bromine), and when hydrogenated, they form Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). So each component in X, after adding H2, becomes C6H12.

So, each component in X must be C6H10, because adding two H2 molecules would give C6H12.

Wait, because hydrogenation is adding H2 across the double bond. So, each alkene in X must be C6H10.

But wait, C6H10 is a mono-alkene. For example, cyclohexene is C6H10.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the number of H in each component of X. Each is C6H10, so 10 H per molecule.

But X is a mixture of two such components, so each contributes 10 H. So total H in X would be 10 + 10 = 20? But looking at the options, 22 is an option (C). Hmm, but 20 isn't an option. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different C6H10 alkenes. So each has 10 H, so total of 20 H in X. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene, but with varying structures. But each would have the same formula, C6H10.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a mono-alkene and a di-alkene. But wait, the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so dienes would have to be isolated.

Wait, if X is a mixture of a mono-alkene and a di-alkene, each without conjugation, but each would have a different number of H.

For example, a mono-alkene is CnH2n, and a di-alkene is CnH2n-2.

But if each upon hydrogenation gives Z, which is C6H12, perhaps each component in X has the formula C6H10.

Wait, let's think: if a compound has the formula C6H10, after adding two H2 molecules (i.e., 4 H atoms), it becomes C6H14? No, wait, no. Wait, Z is C6H12. So each component in X must have two H less than Z. So if Z is C6H12, X's components are C6H10.

Because adding two H's (from one H2) would give C6H12, but wait, no. Wait, no: hydrogenation adds H2 across each double bond. For a mono-alkene, adding one H2 would take it from C6H10 to C6H12.

So each component in X is C6H10, and each, upon hydrogenation, gives C6H12.

So, each component in X has 10 H atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such components, the total H atoms would be 10 + 10 = 20. But none of the options is 20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each component isn't C6H10. Let me think again.

If Z is C6H12, then each component in X must, after hydrogenation, form Z. So, for a mono-alkene, each must have the formula C6H10. Because adding one H2 (two H atoms) would make it C6H12.

Wait, but if a component is a di-alkene (two double bonds), then each would need two H2 additions to become C6H12. So, the starting material would be C6H8.

But the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds, so the di-alkene would have to be isolated. But it's possible.

So, X could be a mixture of a mono-alkene (C6H10) and a di-alkene (C6H8).

Each upon hydrogenation would give C6H12.

So, for the mono-alkene: H count is 10 per molecule.

For the di-alkene: H count is 8 per molecule.

So, in X, which is a 1:1 mixture of two components, each with 10 and 8 H respectively.

Total H in X would be (10 + 8) = 18. So total H is 18. Which is option B.

Wait, that matches one of the options. Let me check.

Each component in X would be:

Component A: C6H10 → 10 H.

Component B: C6H8 → 8 H.

So, equimolar mixture (1 mole each), total H is 10 + 8 = 18.

Which is option B) 18.

So this seems to fit.

Now, let's think about Y. Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction of X. So, each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction.

Disproportionation of an alkene—how? Well, perhaps one of the alkenes is being oxidized and reduced. But alkenes typically undergo addition reactions, not redox.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that can undergo a disproportionation reaction, like breaking into smaller alkanes and alkenes. For example, maybe the alkene is breaking into a smaller alkene and a larger alkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without halogens, that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps each alkene in X is being converted into a diol, but that wouldn't explain the formation of Y as a mixture of alkanes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the cyclic alkenes. For example, cyclohexene upon heating with Pt could ring-open into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation, but in a way that produces a mixture of alkanes and alkenes. But that doesn't fit with Y not having double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but that would produce more alkenes, which isn't the case here.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but the calculation for the hydrogen count seems to fit. So, if each component in X is C6H10 and C6H8, the total H in mixture X would be 18, which is option B.


The problem involves a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes). When treated with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y's components are saturated (alkanes). Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z, a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), as its hydrogen mass fraction matches the given value.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:  
   Since both X and Y hydrogenate to form Z (C₆H₁₂), the components of X must be unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) that add hydrogen to become cyclohexane. Similarly, the components of Y must be saturated compounds (alkanes) that do not react with hydrogen but are derived from X via disproportionation.

2. **Components of X**:  
   X is a mixture of two liquids with unsaturated bonds. Based on the hydrogenation reaction, the components of X are likely mono-alkenes or di-alkenes. For simplicity, assume X contains one mono-alkene (C₆H₁₀) and one di-alkene (C₆H₈). Each of these components has no conjugated double bonds, as stated in the problem.

3. **Hydrogen Count in X**:  
   - The mono-alkene (C₆H₁₀) contains 10 hydrogen atoms.  
   - The di-alkene (C₆H₈) contains 8 hydrogen atoms.  
   Since X is an equimolar mixture of these two components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:  
   \[
   10 + 8 = 18
   \]

4. **Verification of Y**:  
   Y is formed via disproportionation of X. The components of Y are likely saturated compounds (alkanes) that do not decolorize bromine water. These components could be derived from the breakdown or rearrangement of the unsaturated components of X.

5. **Consistency with Z**:  
   Both X and Y hydrogenate to form Z (C₆H₁₂), confirming that the components of X and Y are consistent with the reaction pathway described.

### Conclusion:
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.
