Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in quantum mechanics, this is a standard problem, especially because it's separable into each spatial dimension.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy. Hmm, okay, so I need to find two things: the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).

First, I think about the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension. Since it's isotropic, each direction (x, y, z) has the same frequency ω. 

In three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, I think it can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh wait, no, wait. Because each dimension's quantum number is a non-negative integer (n_x, n_y, n_z ≥ 0), the total n would be their sum. So the energy depends on n, which starts from 0.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So n=0, giving E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next possible energy level, which occurs when n=1. So for n=1, E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Then n=2 gives E = (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. So I need to clarify: the ground state is the first state, first excited is the next, then second, third, etc. So the energy levels are ordered by increasing n.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy depends on the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. So for a 3D oscillator, the possible energy levels are E_n where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n corresponds to a certain energy, and each energy level has a certain number of states (degeneracy) as determined by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers.

But wait, the ordering of the energy levels isn't strictly increasing with n because different n can have the same n. Wait, no, no. For example, n=0 is the ground state, E = (3/2)ħω. Then n=1 gives E=(5/2) ħω. Then n=2 gives E=(7/2) ħω, n=3 gives (9/2), etc. But wait, isn't that the case, or can there be other states with the same n but different energies? No, because the potential is isotropic, so all states with the same n should have the same energy. So each n corresponds to a single energy level.

Wait, but wait, I'm mixing up the 3D case. Because in 3D, each state is characterized by the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, and the energy depends on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So for each possible n, all possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to n have the same energy. So each n corresponds to a unique energy level, and the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So the ground state is n=0, E=3/2 ħω.

The first excited state would be n=1, E=5/2 ħω.

Second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ħω.

Third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ħω.

So the energy should be (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, that would match options A and C. Because option A says (9/2) ħω, and option C also says (9/2) ħω. So the energy part is settled.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. That's the degeneracy, the number of states with the same energy. So how many ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, since for the third excited state, n=3.

The number of distinct (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets where each is a non-negative integer and their sum is 3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3 is (3 + 3 -1) choose (3-1) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So for energy (9/2) ħω, there are 10 eigenfunctions. Looking at the options, option A has 10, option C has 3. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. The third excited state is n=3 because the ground state is n=0.

So the energies are:

n=0 → 3/2 ħω (ground state)

n=1 → 5/2 ħω (first excited)

n=2 →7/2 (second excited)

n=3 →9/2 (third excited)

Yes, correct. And the degeneracy is 10.

Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. So that's correct.

Option B and D have wrong energy expressions, involving pi and r, which doesn't fit because the harmonic oscillator in 3D has energy levels proportional to ħω, not involving r. So those can be dismissed.

So the answer should be A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = (n + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of distinct ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$.

For the third excited state, $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of this energy level is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Using combinatorial analysis, the number of solutions is:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correct, as it states the energy is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy is 10.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it includes an irrelevant term involving $\pi^2$ and $r$, which does not appear in the energy expression for a harmonic oscillator.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it states the degeneracy is 3, which is incorrect for $n = 3$.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it includes the same irrelevant term as Option B.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Alternatively, I think it can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh wait, no, wait. Because each dimension's quantum number is a non-negative integer (n_x, n_y, n_z ≥ 0), the total n would be their sum. So the energy depends on n, which starts from 0.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So n=0, giving E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next possible energy level, which occurs when n=1. So for n=1, E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Then n=2 gives E = (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. So I need to clarify: the ground state is the first state, first excited is the next, then second, third, etc. So the energy levels are ordered by increasing n.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy depends on the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. So for a 3D oscillator, the possible energy levels are E_n where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n corresponds to a certain energy, and each energy level has a certain number of states (degeneracy) as determined by the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers.

But wait, the ordering of the energy levels isn't strictly increasing with n because different n can have the same n. Wait, no, no. For example, n=0 is the ground state, E = (3/2)ħω. Then n=1 gives E=(5/2) ħω. Then n=2 gives E=(7/2) ħω, n=3 gives (9/2), etc. But wait, isn't that the case, or can there be other states with the same n but different energies? No, because the potential is isotropic, so all states with the same n should have the same energy. So each n corresponds to a single energy level.

Wait, but wait, I'm mixing up the 3D case. Because in 3D, each state is characterized by the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, and the energy depends on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So for each possible n, all possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to n have the same energy. So each n corresponds to a unique energy level, and the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So the ground state is n=0, E=3/2 ħω.

The first excited state would be n=1, E=5/2 ħω.

Second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ħω.

Third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ħω.

So the energy should be (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, that would match options A and C. Because option A says (9/2) ħω, and option C also says (9/2) ħω. So the energy part is settled.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue. That's the degeneracy, the number of states with the same energy. So how many ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, since for the third excited state, n=3.

The number of distinct (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets where each is a non-negative integer and their sum is 3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3 is (3 + 3 -1) choose (3-1) ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So for energy (9/2) ħω, there are 10 eigenfunctions. Looking at the options, option A has 10, option C has 3. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. The third excited state is n=3 because the ground state is n=0.

So the energies are:

n=0 → 3/2 ħω (ground state)

n=1 → 5/2 ħω (first excited)

n=2 →7/2 (second excited)

n=3 →9/2 (third excited)

Yes, correct. And the degeneracy is 10.

Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. So that's correct.

Option B and D have wrong energy expressions, involving pi and r, which doesn't fit because the harmonic oscillator in 3D has energy levels proportional to ħω, not involving r. So those can be dismissed.

So the answer should be A.
