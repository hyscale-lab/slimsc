Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember transiting is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass. Both have circular orbits. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period depends on the distance and the star's mass.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius? That's interesting. More massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe in this case, they're evolved differently.

The transit probability formula, I think it's something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, wait. I think the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Oh, right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) because the probability is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. Wait, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, but also considering the alignment. Oh, but wait, the actual probability also depends on the orbital distance. Because even if the planet is big relative to the star, if it's far away, the chance of alignment is lower.

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't just about the size. The actual formula for the probability of a planet transiting is given by (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a (1 - e))², but assuming e=0 here because the orbits are circular. So it's (R_s + R_p)^2 / a². But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_s^2) / a². Wait, no, wait. That's the area of the circle where the planet can be in front. So the probability is (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 times (something else).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability (P) is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The formula I remember is P = (R_s + R_p) / a, but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, no, that's for the duration or something else.

Wait, let me recall. The transit probability formula is P = (R_s * sin i) / a, but since sin i is 1 for edge-on orbits, which is the best case, then P is proportional to (R_s / a). Wait, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio (R_s / a) multiplied by some function.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for transit probability. I remember that the probability is approximately (R_s / a)^2 * (something else), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk as seen from the planet's position, divided by the area of the orbit's cross-section. Or wait, no, the other way around. The planet must lie within a small cone for the transit to happen. So, the probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Because the cross-section is πa², and the area where the planet can be aligned is π(R_s)^2. Wait, no, the area where the planet can transit is a circle of diameter R_s around the center of the star. So the area is π R_s^2. The total possible area for the planet's position is π a² (the area of the orbit's circle). So the probability would be (R_s / a)^2. Oh, that makes sense.

So, the transit probability P = (R_s / a)^2. Because it's the ratio of the area where the planet can cause a transit (a circle of radius R_s) to the total area of the orbit (a circle of radius a). So yes, P = (R_s / a)^2.

So, to compute it for each planet, we need R_s and a for each.

Wait, but what's a? a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that a^3 / P^2 = G(M_s) / (4π²). So, a = [ (G M_s P^2)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But since both planets are around stars with different masses, and their periods are different, their a's are different.

Wait, let's compute a for each planet.

Let me denote:

M1: mass of star with Planet_1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of star with Planet_2.

P1: period of Planet_1 = (1/3) P2.

So, compute a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's third law:

a1^3 / (P1^2) = G M1 / (4 π²)

a2^3 / (P2^2) = G M2 / (4 π²)

So, a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π² )

Similarly for a2.

But let's take the ratio a1/a2.

We can write a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1^2)/(P2^2)

M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2.

So,

(M1/M2) = 2, and (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So,

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9).

Let me compute cube root of 2/9. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So, a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2/9 is 0.2222...

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606, because 0.6^3=0.216, 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So, a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Now, R_s is same for both stars. Because the problem says both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

Now, transit probability P = (R/a)^2.

So P1 = (R/a1)^2, P2 = (R/a2)^2.

Compute the ratio P1/P2 = (R^2 /a1^2 ) / (R^2 /a2^2 ) ) = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

We have a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 = 2.72. That means P1 is ~2.72 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because Planet_1 is closer to a more massive star. Wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is higher when R/a is larger. Since a1 is smaller than a2, R/a1 is larger. So P1 should be higher than P2.

Wait, but according to the calculation, P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So D.

But wait, did I make a miscalculation? Let me double-check.

Compute a1/a2:

a1^3/a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2.

M1/M2= 2, P1/P2= 1/3. So (1/3)^2=1/9.

So 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, a1 is less than a2. Because a1 is for Planet_1, which has a shorter period and more massive star, so it's closer. So a1 is smaller than a2.

So a2 = a1 * (1/0.606) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So when computing P1 = (R/a1)^2, P2 = (R/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) = ( (1.65 a1)^2 ) / a1^2 = (2.7225) a1² / a1² = 2.7225.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the transit probability only a function of R/a, or are there other factors?

Wait, another factor: the star's radius and the planet's size. But the question says both planets have the same mass, but radii are not given. Wait, no, the question provides that the host stars have the same radii. But the planet's radius isn't given. Oh, but the formula for transit probability, as we've considered, depends on R_s / a, assuming R_p << R_s, which is the case for Earth-like planets. So the planet's radius doesn't significantly affect the probability; it's about whether the planet's orbit is aligned. So the same R_p would have the same effect on both, but since the stars have the same radius, and we're only considering the alignment, the R_s is the same for both.

Wait, but no—wait, the formula I used is correct because the probability depends on R_s / a, and since R_s is the same for both stars, the ratio a determines the probability.

So yes, Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 2.7 times higher. So the answer is D.

To determine which planet has a higher transit probability, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability depends on the ratio \(1/a^2\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Kepler's Third Law
Using Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s P^2
\]

where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star and \(P\) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{9}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Because the cross-section is πa², and the area where the planet can be aligned is π(R_s)^2. Wait, no, the area where the planet can transit is a circle of diameter R_s around the center of the star. So the area is π R_s^2. The total possible area for the planet's position is π a² (the area of the orbit's circle). So the probability would be (R_s / a)^2. Oh, that makes sense.

So, the transit probability P = (R_s / a)^2. Because it's the ratio of the area where the planet can cause a transit (a circle of radius R_s) to the total area of the orbit (a circle of radius a). So yes, P = (R_s / a)^2.

So, to compute it for each planet, we need R_s and a for each.

Wait, but what's a? a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that a^3 / P^2 = G(M_s) / (4π²). So, a = [ (G M_s P^2)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But since both planets are around stars with different masses, and their periods are different, their a's are different.

Wait, let's compute a for each planet.

Let me denote:

M1: mass of star with Planet_1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of star with Planet_2.

P1: period of Planet_1 = (1/3) P2.

So, compute a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's third law:

a1^3 / (P1^2) = G M1 / (4 π²)

a2^3 / (P2^2) = G M2 / (4 π²)

So, a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π² )

Similarly for a2.

But let's take the ratio a1/a2.

We can write a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1^2)/(P2^2)

M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = (1/3) P2.

So,

(M1/M2) = 2, and (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So,

a1^3 / a2^3 = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So,

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of (2/9).

Let me compute cube root of 2/9. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So, a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2/9 is 0.2222...

The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606, because 0.6^3=0.216, 0.606^3 ≈ 0.222.

So, a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Now, R_s is same for both stars. Because the problem says both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

Now, transit probability P = (R/a)^2.

So P1 = (R/a1)^2, P2 = (R/a2)^2.

Compute the ratio P1/P2 = (R^2 /a1^2 ) / (R^2 /a2^2 ) ) = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

We have a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So, (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 = 2.72. That means P1 is ~2.72 times higher than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because Planet_1 is closer to a more massive star. Wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is higher when R/a is larger. Since a1 is smaller than a2, R/a1 is larger. So P1 should be higher than P2.

Wait, but according to the calculation, P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

So, looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. So D.

But wait, did I make a miscalculation? Let me double-check.

Compute a1/a2:

a1^3/a2^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2.

M1/M2= 2, P1/P2= 1/3. So (1/3)^2=1/9.

So 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Wait, no, a1 is less than a2. Because a1 is for Planet_1, which has a shorter period and more massive star, so it's closer. So a1 is smaller than a2.

So a2 = a1 * (1/0.606) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So when computing P1 = (R/a1)^2, P2 = (R/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) ) = ( (1.65 a1)^2 ) / a1^2 = (2.7225) a1² / a1² = 2.7225.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

So the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the transit probability only a function of R/a, or are there other factors?

Wait, another factor: the star's radius and the planet's size. But the question says both planets have the same mass, but radii are not given. Wait, no, the question provides that the host stars have the same radii. But the planet's radius isn't given. Oh, but the formula for transit probability, as we've considered, depends on R_s / a, assuming R_p << R_s, which is the case for Earth-like planets. So the planet's radius doesn't significantly affect the probability; it's about whether the planet's orbit is aligned. So the same R_p would have the same effect on both, but since the stars have the same radius, and we're only considering the alignment, the R_s is the same for both.

Wait, but no—wait, the formula I used is correct because the probability depends on R_s / a, and since R_s is the same for both stars, the ratio a determines the probability.

So yes, Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 2.7 times higher. So the answer is D.


To determine which planet has a higher transit probability, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability depends on the ratio \(1/a^2\). A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Kepler's Third Law
Using Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s P^2
\]

where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star and \(P\) is the orbital period. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{9}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a significantly higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
