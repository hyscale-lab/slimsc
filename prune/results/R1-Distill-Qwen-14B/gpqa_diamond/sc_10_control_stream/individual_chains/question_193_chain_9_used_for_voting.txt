Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by the parallax to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Wait, but parallax and distance are related, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is 1 over distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, then substituting plx with 1/r, that becomes N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 divided by (1/r)^5 is the same as (r^5), because (1/(1/r^5)) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Hmm, but wait, I need to be careful here. Because the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So if N increases with r^5, then for each additional distance r, the number of stars goes up by r^5. 

Wait, but I should think about it in terms of differential. Like, the change in N with respect to r. So if N = kr^5 (where k is a constant), then dN/dr would be 5kr^4. So the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to r^4. Hmm, but the question isn't about the derivative per se. Let me read again.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So they're asking about the change in the number of stars as you move a unit distance. So maybe it's about the differential, the rate at which the number changes with r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the change over a small dr is dN = 5kr^4 dr. So per unit distance (dr = 1), dN = 5kr^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4 when you consider the change per unit distance.

Wait, but the options are about the dependence on r. So the options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2. So the correct answer would be the one that says it's proportional to r^4. So that would be option C.

Wait, but I thought N is proportional to r^5. Oh wait, the question is about the change in the number of stars as a function of distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as you go further out. But the question is about how the number changes with distance; that is, the rate of change. So the rate would be proportional to r^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars added is proportional to r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Maybe it's not about the derivative, but the number of stars in a small shell of radius r and thickness dr. So the number of stars in a shell would be the change in N with r multiplied by dr. So dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5kr^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit volume in that shell would depend on r^4. Wait, no, the shell's volume is 4π r² dr, so the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = (dN/dr) dr = 5kr^4 dr.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this. Let me think again. The initial statement is that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. So if you move from a distance r to r + dr, the change in N is proportional to r^5 - (r + dr)^5. But for small dr, that's approximately 5 r^4 dr. So the rate is proportional to r^4.

But the problem is asking, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance)"? So I think they're asking for the derivative. So the change per unit distance is dN/dr, which is 5kr^4. So the number of stars increases by about r^4 per unit distance.

So looking at the options, C is ~r^4. So the correct answer is option C.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this into the proportionality gives \( N \propto r^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \) gives:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars increases with distance at a rate proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.
