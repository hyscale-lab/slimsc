Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. Let's start by figuring out what Compound X is by looking at the IR and NMR data.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I remember that IR peaks help identify functional groups. The 3400–2500 region is usually for O-H or N-H stretches. But 3400 is more likely to be O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, if it's a broad peak, it might be a carboxylic acid. But also, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's probably a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if there's a 1720 peak, that's a bit lower than a typical carbonyl like a ketone (around 1700-1750). Hmm. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is a broad peak. Oh wait, the first IR peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad area, possibly indicating an O-H group. So maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but the O-H in alcohols is usually a broad peak, but maybe around 3300. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the 1720 could be an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe an acid chloride is higher, but that's not present here. So perhaps a carboxylic acid, which would have both a broad O-H peak and a carbonyl around 1700. So 1720 is about right for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another peak is at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound, probably with substituents. So the molecule has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break them down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. So that fits with the IR data suggesting a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet around 8.0, which is in the aromatic region. This suggests two protons that are equivalent and next to substituents. Maybe a para-substituted benzene. So like two protons in a para-substituted benzene, perhaps as substituents in the para positions.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, lower downfield, perhaps the other two protons in the aromatic ring. So if the substituents are in para positions, maybe one is a carboxylic acid group and the other is an alkyl group.
Wait, but wait, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet, so maybe it's attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The 7.2 might be attached to an electron-donating group, like an alkyl.

Wait, but let's think about substituents on benzene. If the substituents are in para positions, then the ortho protons would be equivalent. Wait, but for a benzene ring with substituents at para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, for example, if you have a substituent at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But I'm not too confident; perhaps it's better to look at the integrals.

So, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) add up to 4H, which is the aromatic ring, so that makes sense. So the benzene has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other is another group, perhaps an alkyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or something. Perhaps part of a branched chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups, like a CH2-CH2-CH3 structure. Or maybe part of a cyclopropane, but that's less likely.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which usually suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH that is split into a doublet. So -CH(CH3)- something.
Wait, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to a CH that is next to another CH2 group. So like a branching.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of a chain. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 or something like that.

Putting this together, the structure might look like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is an isobutyl group or similar. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR shows 1H at 10.5 ppm (COOH), then two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, or 2 and 5, etc. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, the substituents would be opposite each other, so maybe positions 1 and 3? No, para is 1 and 4. So substituents at para positions would cause the adjacent protons to be equivalent as doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and 1. So, for example, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4. But wait, in that case, the substituents would be para to each other. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, it's possible that the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So, the substituent could be an ethyl group or an isobutyl group.

Looking at the aliphatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to another CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is perhaps a branching point. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

Wait, this looks like an isobutyl group. Because isobutyl has a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, an isobutyl group is (CH2)2CH-CH2-? No, wait. Isobutyl is -CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not right. Wait, isobutyl has a branching. Let me think. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2, but actually, that's probably not correct. Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)2CHCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure: The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Let's think: the isobutyl group is a four-carbon chain, with the branch at the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that can't be right because that would be pentyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH(CH2CH3)CH2- something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to a CH which is in turn adjacent to a CH3. So perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH2CH3)2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So, maybe the structure is something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a possible structure.

Putting it all together, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is a branched alkyl group. The substituent seems to have a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is an isobutyl group, then the structure would be benzene with COOH at one position and isobutyl at the para position.

So, the initial compound X would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let's check the NMR again. The substituent's NMR signals: at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH of the isobutyl group. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH, and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal CH3.

Wait, isobutyl group is usually (CH2)2CHCH3. Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or is it CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think again: the substituent's NMR suggests it's a branching. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH which is adjacent to another CH2. Then, the 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH3. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that's not right. Alternatively, it could be a (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, maybe it's a (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that would not fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a iso-propyl group attached to another CH2. So, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but that would have a (CH3)2CH- group, but the NMR doesn't show the right splitting.

Alternatively, considering the NMR shifts:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe the structure is a -CH(CH3)- group. Then, attached to that is a CH2 group which is next to another CH2. So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, looking at the options, perhaps I can figure out the structure from the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Hmm, that would be a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid, but at position 2. But our compound's NMR shows a para-substituted benzene, so option A might not fit.

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

That would mean the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl).

What's a sec-butyl group? The sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I think it's more accurately -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- ? Or is it -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-?

Hmm, perhaps I should recall that the butyl groups have different structures: n-butyl, iso-butyl, and sec-butyl.

n-Butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but as a substituent it's -(CH2)3CH3.

iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should just draw it.

n-Butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached via the first carbon.

iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)2 attached via the first carbon.

sec-butyl: CH3CH(CH2CH3)- attached via the second carbon. Wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached via the second carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached via the second carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think of butyl as four carbons. So, for sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR data again. The aliphatic region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably a CH group adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

This suggests a structure where the chain has a branching. For example, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, no, because the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. No, that's iso-pentyl, which is longer than butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain with a branch. Alternatively, maybe it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be iso-pentyl.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and an iso-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, then the NMR signals would correspond to:

The iso-butyl group has a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 would be attached to the benzene, followed by a CH that's attached to two CH3 groups.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 group attached to benzene would be adjacent to the CH, so the CH2 protons would be around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet, perhaps split into a triplet or a quartet. But the given NMR shows 1.7 ppm as m (multiplet) for 2H, which could fit.

The CH would be at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (since it's adjacent to two CH2 groups and maybe others), and the CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

Wait, but wait: the iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 would be between the benzene and the CH. The CH has two CH3 groups attached. So the -CH2- would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. So the CH2 protons would be around 1.7 ppm as a quartet perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet. Hmm, maybe that's possible.

Then the CH would have a CH3 group attached, but in this structure, the CH has two CH3 groups. So the CH3 groups would be attached to the same carbon, so their protons would be a singlet. But the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), so that doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the right structure.

Hmm, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that doesn't make sense because the substituent would have four carbons, right?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

In this case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 attached to the benzene would have protons around 2.9 ppm, maybe as a multiplet.

The next CH group (CH(CH3)) would have protons around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

The CH3 attached to this CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, that seems to fit. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons, but our substituent is attached as a butyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. But that would make it a pentyl substituent, which doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So, what's the structure of a sec-butyl group attached to benzene? It would be:

Ph-COOH

|

Ph-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct substituent for a sec-butyl group would be Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, the NMR would show the CH2 (attached to benzene) as a triplet or quartet, the CH (with two CH3) as a multiplet, and the CH3s as a singlet. But the given NMR doesn't have a singlet for 3H; the 1.4 ppm is a doublet and 0.9 is a triplet. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the aliphatic region again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups and a CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group.

Wait, let's outline the substituent:

The substituent is attached to the benzene as:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but that's perhaps a pentyl group, but again, maybe it's a butyl group with branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene and then a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). That would make it a iso-pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2. No, that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg reaction, which is used to distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. Alternatively, wait, no, the Hinsberg reaction involves reacting an amide with HCl and then treating with red phosphorus and base to see if phenolphthalein turns pink.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI. Another reaction that comes to mind is the reaction of alcohols with HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps X has a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but that usually involves magnesium, not phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used as a reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. For example, if X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, then HI would substitute that with iodide.

But in this case, the initial compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, as indicated by the IR and NMR data. So benzoic acid (option C) would have a COOH group, and the substituent would be a sec-butyl.

So, when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of substitution or elimination.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to convert alcohols to iodides. For example, in the presence of HI, an alcohol may undergo substitution to form an alkyl iodide. But wait, benzoic acid isn't an alcohol. So maybe the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that removes a functional group. Wait, if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into an iodide.

But I'm not very confident about this step. Maybe I should think of the reaction as replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with iodide. But that would require activating the acid, perhaps as an acid chloride, then substituting. But I don't think HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit with the data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again about the initial structure.

The IR suggests a carboxylic acid, so X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent on the benzene ring. The substituent is an alkyl group, perhaps with branching.

So, the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the presence of an alcohol. But X is a benzoic acid, which isn't an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by iodide. But that's more typical of alkanes undergoing substitution, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group. But X doesn't have a good leaving group, unless there's a tosylate or something. But according to the NMR, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's an iso-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into an acyl iodide. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But I'm not certain about the conditions.

Another approach: looking at the options, the product after reaction is among the choices. Let's see what each option represents.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have the COOH group on a propyl chain attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group. Not sure how that would form from X.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the para positions. Wait, but the starting material has a COOH group, so this product would imply the loss of the COOH, which isn't indicated by the reaction (unless it's a substitution).

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the same as X, which doesn't make sense as the product.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

Wait, but the starting material X is a benzoic acid. So the reaction must be converting the COOH group into something else, perhaps an iodide or a methyl group.

Hmm, but how would that happen? Maybe the reaction is decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative that, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, loses the acid group and gains an iodide. For example, if X is a benzene ring with a COOH and an alkyl group, the reaction could replace the COOH with an iodide.

But I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a good leaving group is replaced by iodide. But in X, the COOH isn't a good leaving group. However, maybe if X is an acyl chloride, then HI would substitute it, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines, but I don't see nitro groups in X.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is deprotonating the carboxylic acid to form the conjugate base, which then reacts with HI to form a carboxylic acid iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a methyl ester into an acid, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to make alkyl iodides from alcohols via the SN2 mechanism. So if X had an alcohol group, it would become an iodide. But X is a benzoic acid, which doesn't have an alcohol group.

Wait, but maybe X has an ester group. Let me think: the IR of X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (carbonyl). So perhaps X is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Wait, that changes things.

Wait, the IR data: 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which would be O-H, but in an ester, the O-H is in an alcohol, but perhaps not. Wait, no, an ester doesn't have an O-H stretch. So the broad peak between 3400–2500 could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to move forward.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid iodide. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is replacing the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with an iodide, forming a benzene ring with an iodide substituent and the sec-butyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? The carboxylic acid is a poor leaving group. Unless it's activated somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is eliminating the COOH group and introducing an iodide in its place. But I don't know the mechanism for that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a benzene ring with methyl and isobutyl groups in para positions. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the product would have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

But how would that form from X, which is a benzoic acid?

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group and adding an iodide. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by HI, producing a benzene ring with an iodide group and the substituent.

But I'm not certain about that. Maybe the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a methyl group, but I don't think HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that usually requires a Lewis acid catalyst and an alkyl halide. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps they are generating an iodide.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH of the COOH group is replaced by iodide. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a benzyl iodide. But I don't have enough knowledge on this specific reaction.

Given the time I've spent, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the same as X. So the reaction doesn't change the compound, which is unlikely. So perhaps option C is not the product.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are sec-butyl and methyl in para positions. How would that form from X, which is a benzoic acid with a substituent?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is deprotonating the COOH group and then substituting it with a methyl group. But that doesn't seem to fit with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation, removing the COOH group and introducing a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the COOH group into a bromide or iodide, but that doesn't directly lead to a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group into a CH2OH, but then further reaction with HI to form CH2I. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the reaction as introducing an iodide in place of the COOH group, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of benzene with an iodide group. For example, the COOH group is replaced by iodide.

So, if X is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, and the reaction replaces the COOH with I, the product would be 4-sec-butylphenyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. How would that happen from X?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but without a Lewis acid, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is converted into a better leaving group, like a tosylate, and then substituted with HI.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe the red phosphorus is acting as a reducing agent, and HI is providing the iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into a methyl iodide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, where HI attacks the carbonyl carbon, but that would form an acyl iodide, not a benzene ring with iodide substituent.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Given that X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction likely changes the functional group, the product might be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with a methyl group, leading to option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the reaction replaces the COOH group with an iodide, but none of the options have iodide, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which would imply no reaction, which is unlikely. So perhaps the reaction does something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into an acyl iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, and then perhaps further reactions happen, but that's not clear.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess. The structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an iodide, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't change the substituent but modifies the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the COOH is lost, and a methyl group is formed. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, decarboxylation would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (option D).

Wait, but how would decarboxylation occur? Benzoic acid typically decarboxylates upon heating, but under what conditions? Maybe the red phosphorus and HI are providing some acidic conditions or heat.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, upon decarboxylation, it would lose CO2 and form 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

That makes sense because the product would have a methyl group (from the decarboxylation) in the para position relative to the sec-butyl group.

So the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range indicates an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** Broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** These signals suggest a branched alkyl group, likely a sec-butyl group.

From the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions suggest a possible decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid group. Benzoic acid derivatives can undergo decarboxylation upon heating or under specific conditions, leading to the loss of CO₂ and the formation of a methyl group. Thus, the COOH group in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is replaced by a methyl group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** Incorrect, as the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid, not a propanoic acid derivative.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** Incorrect, as the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** Incorrect, as this is the starting material, not the product.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** Correct, as this is the product formed after decarboxylation of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. Let's start by figuring out what Compound X is by looking at the IR and NMR data.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. I remember that IR peaks help identify functional groups. The 3400–2500 region is usually for O-H or N-H stretches. But 3400 is more likely to be O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, if it's a broad peak, it might be a carboxylic acid. But also, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's probably a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if there's a 1720 peak, that's a bit lower than a typical carbonyl like a ketone (around 1700-1750). Hmm. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is a broad peak. Oh wait, the first IR peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad area, possibly indicating an O-H group. So maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol, but the O-H in alcohols is usually a broad peak, but maybe around 3300. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the 1720 could be an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe an acid chloride is higher, but that's not present here. So perhaps a carboxylic acid, which would have both a broad O-H peak and a carbonyl around 1700. So 1720 is about right for a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another peak is at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound, probably with substituents. So the molecule has a benzene ring and a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break them down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. So that fits with the IR data suggesting a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet around 8.0, which is in the aromatic region. This suggests two protons that are equivalent and next to substituents. Maybe a para-substituted benzene. So like two protons in a para-substituted benzene, perhaps as substituents in the para positions.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, lower downfield, perhaps the other two protons in the aromatic ring. So if the substituents are in para positions, maybe one is a carboxylic acid group and the other is an alkyl group.
Wait, but wait, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet, so maybe it's attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The 7.2 might be attached to an electron-donating group, like an alkyl.

Wait, but let's think about substituents on benzene. If the substituents are in para positions, then the ortho protons would be equivalent. Wait, but for a benzene ring with substituents at para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, for example, if you have a substituent at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. But I'm not too confident; perhaps it's better to look at the integrals.

So, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) add up to 4H, which is the aromatic ring, so that makes sense. So the benzene has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other is another group, perhaps an alkyl chain.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to another CH2 or something. Perhaps part of a branched chain.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps two adjacent CH2 groups, like a CH2-CH2-CH3 structure. Or maybe part of a cyclopropane, but that's less likely.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which usually suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH that is split into a doublet. So -CH(CH3)- something.
Wait, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to a CH that is next to another CH2 group. So like a branching.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, like at the end of a chain. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 or something like that.

Putting this together, the structure might look like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is an isobutyl group or similar. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR shows 1H at 10.5 ppm (COOH), then two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, or 2 and 5, etc. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, the substituents would be opposite each other, so maybe positions 1 and 3? No, para is 1 and 4. So substituents at para positions would cause the adjacent protons to be equivalent as doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 4 and 1. So, for example, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4. But wait, in that case, the substituents would be para to each other. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, it's possible that the substituent is at position 4, and the COOH is at position 1. So, the substituent could be an ethyl group or an isobutyl group.

Looking at the aliphatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to another CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is perhaps a branching point. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

Wait, this looks like an isobutyl group. Because isobutyl has a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, an isobutyl group is (CH2)2CH-CH2-? No, wait. Isobutyl is -CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that's not right. Wait, isobutyl has a branching. Let me think. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2, but actually, that's probably not correct. Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)2CHCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure: The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Let's think: the isobutyl group is a four-carbon chain, with the branch at the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that can't be right because that would be pentyl. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH(CH2CH3)CH2- something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to a CH which is in turn adjacent to a CH3. So perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH2CH3)2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So, maybe the structure is something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a possible structure.

Putting it all together, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is a branched alkyl group. The substituent seems to have a CH(CH3) group attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to another CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is an isobutyl group, then the structure would be benzene with COOH at one position and isobutyl at the para position.

So, the initial compound X would be 4-(isobutyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let's check the NMR again. The substituent's NMR signals: at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be the CH of the isobutyl group. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH, and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal CH3.

Wait, isobutyl group is usually (CH2)2CHCH3. Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or is it CH2CH(CH2CH3)? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, wait. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think again: the substituent's NMR suggests it's a branching. The 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH which is adjacent to another CH2. Then, the 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH3. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that's not right. Alternatively, it could be a (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, maybe it's a (CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that would not fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a iso-propyl group attached to another CH2. So, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but that would have a (CH3)2CH- group, but the NMR doesn't show the right splitting.

Alternatively, considering the NMR shifts:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe the structure is a -CH(CH3)- group. Then, attached to that is a CH2 group which is next to another CH2. So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, looking at the options, perhaps I can figure out the structure from the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Hmm, that would be a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid, but at position 2. But our compound's NMR shows a para-substituted benzene, so option A might not fit.

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

That would mean the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl).

What's a sec-butyl group? The sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I think it's more accurately -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- ? Or is it -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-?

Hmm, perhaps I should recall that the butyl groups have different structures: n-butyl, iso-butyl, and sec-butyl.

n-Butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but as a substituent it's -(CH2)3CH3.

iso-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, iso-butyl is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3). No, wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should just draw it.

n-Butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached via the first carbon.

iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)2 attached via the first carbon.

sec-butyl: CH3CH(CH2CH3)- attached via the second carbon. Wait, no. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached via the second carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached via the second carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think of butyl as four carbons. So, for sec-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, looking at the NMR data again. The aliphatic region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably a CH group adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

This suggests a structure where the chain has a branching. For example, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, no, because the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. No, that's iso-pentyl, which is longer than butyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, that would be a three-carbon chain with a branch. Alternatively, maybe it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be iso-pentyl.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group at position 1 and an iso-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, then the NMR signals would correspond to:

The iso-butyl group has a structure like CH2-CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 would be attached to the benzene, followed by a CH that's attached to two CH3 groups.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 group attached to benzene would be adjacent to the CH, so the CH2 protons would be around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet, perhaps split into a triplet or a quartet. But the given NMR shows 1.7 ppm as m (multiplet) for 2H, which could fit.

The CH would be at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet (since it's adjacent to two CH2 groups and maybe others), and the CH3 groups attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

Wait, but wait: the iso-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 would be between the benzene and the CH. The CH has two CH3 groups attached. So the -CH2- would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. So the CH2 protons would be around 1.7 ppm as a quartet perhaps, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet. Hmm, maybe that's possible.

Then the CH would have a CH3 group attached, but in this structure, the CH has two CH3 groups. So the CH3 groups would be attached to the same carbon, so their protons would be a singlet. But the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), so that doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the right structure.

Hmm, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, that's not right. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that doesn't make sense because the substituent would have four carbons, right?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

In this case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 attached to the benzene would have protons around 2.9 ppm, maybe as a multiplet.

The next CH group (CH(CH3)) would have protons around 1.7 ppm as a multiplet.

The CH3 attached to this CH would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet.

The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, that seems to fit. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons, but our substituent is attached as a butyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. But that would make it a pentyl substituent, which doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So, what's the structure of a sec-butyl group attached to benzene? It would be:

Ph-COOH

|

Ph-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the correct substituent for a sec-butyl group would be Ph-CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3), but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, the NMR would show the CH2 (attached to benzene) as a triplet or quartet, the CH (with two CH3) as a multiplet, and the CH3s as a singlet. But the given NMR doesn't have a singlet for 3H; the 1.4 ppm is a doublet and 0.9 is a triplet. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the aliphatic region again. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH connected to two CH2 groups and a CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group.

Wait, let's outline the substituent:

The substituent is attached to the benzene as:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-

Wait, but that's perhaps a pentyl group, but again, maybe it's a butyl group with branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to the benzene and then a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). That would make it a iso-pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2. No, that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction.

The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hinsberg reaction, which is used to distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. Alternatively, wait, no, the Hinsberg reaction involves reacting an amide with HCl and then treating with red phosphorus and base to see if phenolphthalein turns pink.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is between X and red phosphorus and HI. Another reaction that comes to mind is the reaction of alcohols with HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps X has a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but that usually involves magnesium, not phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Wait, red phosphorus is sometimes used as a reducing agent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. For example, if X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate or mesylate, then HI would substitute that with iodide.

But in this case, the initial compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, as indicated by the IR and NMR data. So benzoic acid (option C) would have a COOH group, and the substituent would be a sec-butyl.

So, when it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of substitution or elimination.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to convert alcohols to iodides. For example, in the presence of HI, an alcohol may undergo substitution to form an alkyl iodide. But wait, benzoic acid isn't an alcohol. So maybe the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that removes a functional group. Wait, if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, perhaps the reaction converts the acid into an iodide.

But I'm not very confident about this step. Maybe I should think of the reaction as replacing the -OH of the carboxylic acid with iodide. But that would require activating the acid, perhaps as an acid chloride, then substituting. But I don't think HI would do that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. But that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit with the data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again about the initial structure.

The IR suggests a carboxylic acid, so X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent on the benzene ring. The substituent is an alkyl group, perhaps with branching.

So, the structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the presence of an alcohol. But X is a benzoic acid, which isn't an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by iodide. But that's more typical of alkanes undergoing substitution, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution of a leaving group. But X doesn't have a good leaving group, unless there's a tosylate or something. But according to the NMR, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that's an iso-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into an acyl iodide. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But I'm not certain about the conditions.

Another approach: looking at the options, the product after reaction is among the choices. Let's see what each option represents.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That would have the COOH group on a propyl chain attached to a 4-ethylphenyl group. Not sure how that would form from X.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the para positions. Wait, but the starting material has a COOH group, so this product would imply the loss of the COOH, which isn't indicated by the reaction (unless it's a substitution).

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the same as X, which doesn't make sense as the product.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

Wait, but the starting material X is a benzoic acid. So the reaction must be converting the COOH group into something else, perhaps an iodide or a methyl group.

Hmm, but how would that happen? Maybe the reaction is decarboxylation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative that, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, loses the acid group and gains an iodide. For example, if X is a benzene ring with a COOH and an alkyl group, the reaction could replace the COOH with an iodide.

But I'm not sure about the mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where a good leaving group is replaced by iodide. But in X, the COOH isn't a good leaving group. However, maybe if X is an acyl chloride, then HI would substitute it, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitro groups to amines, but I don't see nitro groups in X.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is deprotonating the carboxylic acid to form the conjugate base, which then reacts with HI to form a carboxylic acid iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting a methyl ester into an acid, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used to make alkyl iodides from alcohols via the SN2 mechanism. So if X had an alcohol group, it would become an iodide. But X is a benzoic acid, which doesn't have an alcohol group.

Wait, but maybe X has an ester group. Let me think: the IR of X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (carbonyl). So perhaps X is an ester, not a carboxylic acid. Wait, that changes things.

Wait, the IR data: 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad peak, which would be O-H, but in an ester, the O-H is in an alcohol, but perhaps not. Wait, no, an ester doesn't have an O-H stretch. So the broad peak between 3400–2500 could be an O-H from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to move forward.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into an acid iodide. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is replacing the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with an iodide, forming a benzene ring with an iodide substituent and the sec-butyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? The carboxylic acid is a poor leaving group. Unless it's activated somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is eliminating the COOH group and introducing an iodide in its place. But I don't know the mechanism for that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a benzene ring with methyl and isobutyl groups in para positions. Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the product would have a sec-butyl group and a methyl group in para positions.

But how would that form from X, which is a benzoic acid?

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is removing the COOH group and adding an iodide. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by HI, producing a benzene ring with an iodide group and the substituent.

But I'm not certain about that. Maybe the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a methyl group, but I don't think HI would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that usually requires a Lewis acid catalyst and an alkyl halide. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps they are generating an iodide.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH of the COOH group is replaced by iodide. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is converting the carboxylic acid into a benzyl iodide. But I don't have enough knowledge on this specific reaction.

Given the time I've spent, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is the same as X. So the reaction doesn't change the compound, which is unlikely. So perhaps option C is not the product.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are sec-butyl and methyl in para positions. How would that form from X, which is a benzoic acid with a substituent?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is deprotonating the COOH group and then substituting it with a methyl group. But that doesn't seem to fit with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation, removing the COOH group and introducing a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is converting the COOH group into a bromide or iodide, but that doesn't directly lead to a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the COOH group into a CH2OH, but then further reaction with HI to form CH2I. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the reaction as introducing an iodide in place of the COOH group, but that's unclear.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a benzoic acid with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of benzene with an iodide group. For example, the COOH group is replaced by iodide.

So, if X is 4-sec-butylbenzoic acid, and the reaction replaces the COOH with I, the product would be 4-sec-butylphenyl iodide. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would have a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. How would that happen from X?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but without a Lewis acid, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the COOH group is converted into a better leaving group, like a tosylate, and then substituted with HI.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe the red phosphorus is acting as a reducing agent, and HI is providing the iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is converted into a methyl iodide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, where HI attacks the carbonyl carbon, but that would form an acyl iodide, not a benzene ring with iodide substituent.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Given that X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction likely changes the functional group, the product might be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in para positions, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with a methyl group, leading to option D.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if the reaction replaces the COOH group with an iodide, but none of the options have iodide, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is a benzoic acid, which would imply no reaction, which is unlikely. So perhaps the reaction does something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into an acyl iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by iodide, and then perhaps further reactions happen, but that's not clear.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess. The structure of X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). When it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an iodide, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't change the substituent but modifies the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the COOH is lost, and a methyl group is formed. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, decarboxylation would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (option D).

Wait, but how would decarboxylation occur? Benzoic acid typically decarboxylates upon heating, but under what conditions? Maybe the red phosphorus and HI are providing some acidic conditions or heat.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, upon decarboxylation, it would lose CO2 and form 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

That makes sense because the product would have a methyl group (from the decarboxylation) in the para position relative to the sec-butyl group.

So the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range indicates an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** Broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** These signals suggest a branched alkyl group, likely a sec-butyl group.

From the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions suggest a possible decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid group. Benzoic acid derivatives can undergo decarboxylation upon heating or under specific conditions, leading to the loss of CO₂ and the formation of a methyl group. Thus, the COOH group in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is replaced by a methyl group, resulting in **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** Incorrect, as the starting material is a para-substituted benzoic acid, not a propanoic acid derivative.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** Incorrect, as the substituent is a sec-butyl group, not an isobutyl group.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** Incorrect, as this is the starting material, not the product.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** Correct, as this is the product formed after decarboxylation of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
