Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The approach involves modifying the GADD45G gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then, they use Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies, they test the expression but can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that when they look at the plus strand sequence of their construct, they notice a specific issue. The options given are possible reasons why the overexpression isn't happening.

Let me think about each option and how they relate to the provided DNA sequence. 

First, the construct adds a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. HA tags are commonly used for protein detection, so the construct should express a fusion protein with HA followed by GADD45G.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag isn't correct. But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, which is the methionine start codon. The HA tag is presumably at the beginning. If the HA had a mutation, the protein might not be recognized for purification, but the question says they can't overexpress it. So perhaps the issue is that the HA is not present, or the mutation is causing the protein to not be expressed. Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence is causing a problem like a premature stop codon.

Wait, looking at the sequence, the start is ATG (position 1-3), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), etc. The HA sequence is probably introduced before the GADD45G coding sequence. So if the HA sequence has a mutation, perhaps introducing a stop codon early. Let me check the first few codons.

The HA tag is a short peptide, maybe something like YPYDVPDYA. The coding sequence for that would be in mRNA as a series of codons. The provided DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA... Let's see, the HA peptide is usually around 10 amino acids. So the first few codons after ATG would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), etc. Wait, the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to TAC Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Tyr Ala. Hmm, but the first codons in the DNA are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA. So that's Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro. Wait, that's longer than HA. Maybe the HA is misinserted or has a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of stop codons in the sequence. If there's a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the HA region, the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein.

Looking at the plus strand sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A... wait, I'm looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the codons.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template as the complement. So the DNA's plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T for U. So the DNA sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A...

Wait, looking for the stop codon in the mRNA. So, in the DNA, a stop codon would be present as TGA in the coding (sense) strand. So look for TGA in the DNA's plus strand. Let's scan through.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh, wait, the 11th codon is TGA (TGA is a stop codon in DNA, which would be TGA in mRNA as well; wait, no, DNA is TGA on the plus strand, so mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

So in the sequence, after the first few codons, there's a TGA at some point. Let me count.

The first few codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. TGA (stop)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. That's only 12 codons into the sequence. So the HA tag is supposed to be at the beginning, but if the HA sequence in the construct includes a TGA, which is a stop codon, then the ribosome would terminate after 12 codons, leading to a very short peptide, probably not enough for the HA tag to function. That would prevent the overexpression because the protein isn't made beyond that point.

So why is there a TGA in the sequence? It might be that the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. Alternatively, the plasmid construct might have a mutation that introduced a stop codon in the HA region.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's coding sequence has a mutation, perhaps introducing a stop codon. That's exactly what's happening here.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's the effect, but why? Because of a stop codon (like in option A or D).

Option C suggests proteolysis due to lack of linker. If the protein is made but quickly degraded, you might not see it. But the sequence suggests that the protein isn't even made because of a premature stop.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, the stop codon is TGA in the DNA (which would be UGA in mRNA). So the stop codon is UGA. But the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. So if the stop codon were UAA, but the tRNA for that doesn't exist, the ribosome wouldn't recognize it. But in this case, it's a UGA stop codon, which is recognized by release factors. So option D isn't the issue here.

So the problem is that there's a TGA stop codon in the construct, causing premature termination. That's probably because the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, introducing a frameshift or a mutation that added a stop codon.

Wait, but why would the HA sequence cause a stop codon? HA is a short peptide, but the construct is adding the HA coding sequence before GADD45G. If the HA was correctly inserted, it would be followed by the start codon of GADD45G. But in the sequence given, the ATG is the very first codon, then the HA coding sequence is added. But if the HA sequence includes a stop codon, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag wasn't properly inserted in frame, causing a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence itself has a TGA codon. Alternatively, the HA might have a stop codon in the middle, but that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, maybe the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift that introduces a stop codon. But the presence of a stop codon at position 12 suggests that the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Because the HA is a short tag, if the insertion wasn't in frame, it would cause a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

But another possibility is that the HA tag's coding sequence is incorrect, leading to a stop codon in the correct frame. For example, a mutation in the HA sequence might have introduced a TGA codon in the correct reading frame.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). So the HA sequence was intended to be at the beginning. HA's coding sequence should be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA for the first 11 codons (33 nucleotides), followed by the TGA stop, which is not part of the HA. So that would mean that the HA coding sequence was correctly inserted, but the TGA is in the middle of HA.

Wait, no, that can't be because HA is a peptide that shouldn't include a stop codon. So perhaps the HA sequence in the construct was not correctly inserted. Maybe the HA sequence was not added in frame, or there's a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence isn't correctly added, leading to an early stop.

So, the HA sequence's coding region in the construct has a mutation, leading to a premature stop codon. So option A says the HA has a missense mutationâ€”so a single nucleotide change leading to an amino acid change. But the issue here is a stop codon, which is a nonsense mutation, not a missense. So option A doesn't explain the stop.

Wait, but the problem says the HA is introduced. The HA is usually a short peptide, so if the HA's coding sequence is messed up, perhaps the HA part includes a stop codon. So in the given sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G should start. But the stop codon is in the middle of the HA.

Wait, perhaps the HA should be 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The first 30 nucleotides of the construct after ATG should be the HA. Then the GADD45G starts. But in the given sequence, the first 12 codons (36 nucleotides) include a stop codon.

So perhaps the HA wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA insert added a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, causing a frameshift and introducing a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted correctly, but the researcher made a mistake in the sequence, adding a TGA in the middle.

Wait, let's think about the DNA sequence. The HA coding sequence starts right after ATG. HA's nucleotide sequence would be the coding sequence for the HA peptide. But if during cloning, a mistake was made, perhaps an extra base was inserted, causing a frameshift. Let's say the HA is 30 nucleotides, but due to a cloning error, it's 31, leading to a frameshift. Then the codons after that would be different, and perhaps a stop codon appears earlier than it should.

But in the given sequence, the first 36 nucleotides (12 codons) include a TGA. That could be a result of a frameshift, leading to a stop after HA.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was correctly inserted, but the construct has a mutation that introduced a TGA in the HA region.

Wait, the problem states that the reason is in the sequence. So looking at the sequence, the first codons after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. So the first 36 bases (12 codons) include the stop at position 36. The HA tag should be the first 10 amino acids, so 30 bases. So the HA sequence in the construct is actually longer, or perhaps includes the TGA. Since the HA shouldn't have a stop codon, perhaps the construct has an extra codon, or a mutation in the HA sequence that introduced a TGA.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, leading to a frameshift that causes a stop.

But looking at the sequence, after the HA would come the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA itself has a stop codon, then the GADD45G isn't even being expressed because the ribosome stops at TGA.

Therefore, the problem is that the HA sequence in the construct includes a premature stop codon, which is likely a result of a mutation in the HA coding sequence. So option A says the HA has a missense mutation, but that wouldn't introduce a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA might have a frameshift leading to a stop.

Wait, but the options don't mention a frameshift. The options are about point mutations or other issues.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was added in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift, which causes the ribosome to hit a stop codon. But I don't think that's one of the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: The HA has a missense mutation. That would be a point mutation resulting in an amino acid change, but not a stop.

Option B: The ribosome stops early. That's the effect, but why?

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA isn't present, perhaps the protein is being degraded by proteases because there's no HA tag for purification. But the problem is overexpression isn't happening, so the issue is likely at the expression level, not degradation.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But the stop is UGA, so D doesn't apply.

Wait, maybe the HA was added in the correct frame but the presence of a stop codon within the HA is causing the issue. If the HA sequence itself has a stop codon, that would be a problem. For example, HA's coding sequence might have a TGA, which the researcher didn't account for.

But HA's coding sequence shouldn't have a stop codon. So if the HA's DNA sequence was modified to introduce a TGA, that would be a mutation. So option A is about a missense mutation in the HA. But a missense mutation changes an amino acid, not introducing a stop. Unless the mutation changes a codon into a stop. For example, a nucleotide change that turns a codon into TGA.

Ah, yes! So a missense mutation in the HA sequence that changes a codon into a TGA would cause a premature stop. So option A would explain the presence of a TGA in the sequence.

Wait, but the HA sequence is provided as the correct sequence. Unless the HA had a mutation, introducing a TGA. So that would be a missense mutation if it changes the amino acid but also creates a stop. Or more accurately, it's a nonsense mutation.

But the options don't have a 'nonsense' option. So option A is the closest, as a missense mutation could include a change that introduces a stop if it's a synonymous or leads to a stop. Wait, no. Missense is an amino acid change without a stop. Nonsense is a stop. So option A isn't exactly correct because it's a stop, not a missense.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The construct has a stop codon after 12 codons, which is in the HA region. So the HA sequence in the construct has a stop codon. Why is that?

Possibility 1: The HA was correctly inserted, but a mutation introduced a TGA, causing a stop.

Possibility 2: The HA was not correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift and an early stop.

But none of the options directly address a frameshift. The options are A to D, which are about point mutations, translation termination, proteolysis, and tRNA absence.

Looking at option B: The ribosome terminated early. So the reason is the stop codon. So why is there a stop codon?

Is it because the HA's coding sequence has a mutation (option A) or because of some other reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence is correct, but the termination is due to the HA sequence causing a read-through into a cryptic promoter or something else. But that's probably not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: the HA is a tag, so the coding sequence should be followed by the GADD45G sequence. If the HA is correctly inserted, then the sequence after the HA should be the start of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, after the stop codon, there's more sequence. Let me look.

Looking at the given DNA sequence beyond the TGA stop:

After TGA comes CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A...

Wait, but the TGA is a stop codon, so the ribosome would terminate before reaching those codons. So the GADD45G isn't even being transcribed because the HA sequence has a stop.

So why is there a TGA in the HA sequence? Maybe the HA was inserted in reverse complement or something, but that's probably not. Or perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a mutation introducing a TGA.

So the conclusion is that the HA's coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a TGA, causing a premature stop. So the problem is that the HA has a mutation leading to a premature stop. But the options don't directly say that. Option A is about a missense mutation, which could include a stop if it's a base change leading to a stop codon.

But wait, a missense mutation changes a codon to another amino acid, but not to a stop. A nonsense mutation changes to a stop. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but the closest would be option A. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA is missing, leading the ribosome to not produce the HA and then not produce the GADD45G. But that doesn't fit with the sequence provided.

Wait, another possibility: the construct is missing the HA tag. But that's not the case here because the sequence starts with HA.

Wait, the other thing I noticed is that the HA sequence is followed by TGA. So the researcher intended to express the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but due to a mutation in the HA, a stop is introduced, so the GADD45G isn't made. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed.

So the issue is that the HA's coding sequence has a mutation leading to a premature stop codon. So the correct option would be that there's a missense mutation in the HA that leads to a stop codon. But since option A says 'missense', which refers to amino acid change, it's not exactly the same. Alternatively, perhaps the construct has a frameshift leading to an early stop. But the options don't mention that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't present, the protein might be degraded. But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's expressed but degraded.

Option B suggests the ribosome stops early because of a stop codon. That's correct, but why is the stop codon there? Because of a mutation in HA.

So the root cause is that the HA sequence has a mutation introducing a stop codon. Since the options don't directly address this, perhaps option A is the intended answer. Because option A is about a mutation in the HA causing an amino acid change, but if that change happens to be a stop codon, then it's the cause.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was not added correctly, leading to a frameshift. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the plus strand has the HA in the correct orientation, but the TGA is part of the HA, which shouldn't be. So the HA's coding sequence is incorrect. So the HA has a mutation leading to a stop codon.

In that case, the correct answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation (which may have introduced a stop codon, but perhaps the question considers it a missense).

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is not followed by the GADD45G, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, causing the TGA to be in the HA. But the sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial ATG is part of the HA, but the HA's coding sequence has a TGA stop codon. So the HA would be expressed, but then the construct would have a stop before GADD45G. So the GADD45G isn't expressed, leading to no overexpression.

So in that case, the problem is a premature stop in the HA sequence, which is why the GADD45G isn't overexpressed.

So, the correct reason is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon, which is a mutation. But the options don't directly say that. So the closest option is A: the HA has a missense mutation. Even though a missense is an amino acid change, but if that leads to a stop, then it's the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's stop codon is due to a frameshift, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA wasn't added at all, but the GADD45G starts with ATG. Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of GADD45G. But that can't be right because HA should be at the N-terminus.

Wait, maybe the HA wasn't added, so the GADD45G is expressed without HA, but that wouldn't explain the stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the HA was added but in a way that introduced a stop.

I think the key is that the construct includes a TGA stop codon after 12 codons, which is in the HA region. So the HA's coding sequence is incorrect, perhaps due to a mutation that introduces a stop.

So the correct answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation. But wait, that's a point mutation leading to an amino acid change. But if the mutation changes a codon into TGA, which is a stop, then it's a nonsense mutation, not a missense. So maybe the intended answer is A, but perhaps the question assumes that a missense mutation could lead to a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence is correct, but the GADD45G is not being expressed because the ribosome stops at TGA. So the reason is that the HA has a stop codon, but how? That would be a mutation in the HA.

So the correct answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the overexpression of the protein is not occurring, and the provided DNA sequence reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) at the 12th codon. This stop codon is located within the region encoding the HA tag, which was intended to be at the N-terminus of the construct. 

The HA tag is a short peptide that should not include a stop codon. The presence of the TGA stop codon suggests that there is an issue with the HA coding sequence. One possibility is that the HA sequence was introduced with a mutation, such as a missense mutation, which inadvertently changed a codon into a stop codon. This would result in the ribosome terminating translation prematurely, preventing the expression of the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation."  
  A missense mutation typically refers to a single nucleotide change that alters an amino acid. However, if the mutation changes a codon into a stop codon (e.g., TGA), it would result in a premature stop. While this is technically a nonsense mutation, the question likely intends for this option to encompass any mutation in the HA sequence that prevents proper expression, making this the most plausible answer.

- **Option B**: "The ribosome terminated the translation early."  
  This is an effect of the premature stop codon but does not explain why the stop codon is present. The question asks for the root cause, so this is not the correct answer.

- **Option C**: "The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain."  
  Proteolysis refers to the degradation of the protein after it is synthesized. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all due to the premature stop codon, making this option irrelevant.

- **Option D**: "The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse."  
  The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Additionally, this option is unrelated to the observed premature stop codon in the HA region.

The most likely explanation is that the HA coding sequence contains a mutation, such as a missense mutation, which introduced the premature stop codon (TGA). This prevents the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein from being expressed, leading to the failure of overexpression. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The approach involves modifying the GADD45G gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then, they use Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies, they test the expression but can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that when they look at the plus strand sequence of their construct, they notice a specific issue. The options given are possible reasons why the overexpression isn't happening.

Let me think about each option and how they relate to the provided DNA sequence. 

First, the construct adds a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. HA tags are commonly used for protein detection, so the construct should express a fusion protein with HA followed by GADD45G.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. That would mean the HA tag isn't correct. But in the given sequence, the start is ATG, which is the methionine start codon. The HA tag is presumably at the beginning. If the HA had a mutation, the protein might not be recognized for purification, but the question says they can't overexpress it. So perhaps the issue is that the HA is not present, or the mutation is causing the protein to not be expressed. Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence is causing a problem like a premature stop codon.

Wait, looking at the sequence, the start is ATG (position 1-3), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), etc. The HA sequence is probably introduced before the GADD45G coding sequence. So if the HA sequence has a mutation, perhaps introducing a stop codon early. Let me check the first few codons.

The HA tag is a short peptide, maybe something like YPYDVPDYA. The coding sequence for that would be in mRNA as a series of codons. The provided DNA starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA... Let's see, the HA peptide is usually around 10 amino acids. So the first few codons after ATG would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), etc. Wait, the HA sequence is YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to TAC Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Tyr Ala. Hmm, but the first codons in the DNA are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA. So that's Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro. Wait, that's longer than HA. Maybe the HA is misinserted or has a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of stop codons in the sequence. If there's a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the HA region, the ribosome would terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein.

Looking at the plus strand sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A... wait, I'm looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in the codons.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the DNA template as the complement. So the DNA's plus strand is the same as the mRNA, except T for U. So the DNA sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A...

Wait, looking for the stop codon in the mRNA. So, in the DNA, a stop codon would be present as TGA in the coding (sense) strand. So look for TGA in the DNA's plus strand. Let's scan through.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Oh, wait, the 11th codon is TGA (TGA is a stop codon in DNA, which would be TGA in mRNA as well; wait, no, DNA is TGA on the plus strand, so mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

So in the sequence, after the first few codons, there's a TGA at some point. Let me count.

The first few codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. TAC (Tyr)
10. GCC (Ala)
11. AAA (Lys)
12. TGA (stop)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. That's only 12 codons into the sequence. So the HA tag is supposed to be at the beginning, but if the HA sequence in the construct includes a TGA, which is a stop codon, then the ribosome would terminate after 12 codons, leading to a very short peptide, probably not enough for the HA tag to function. That would prevent the overexpression because the protein isn't made beyond that point.

So why is there a TGA in the sequence? It might be that the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. Alternatively, the plasmid construct might have a mutation that introduced a stop codon in the HA region.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's coding sequence has a mutation, perhaps introducing a stop codon. That's exactly what's happening here.

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That's the effect, but why? Because of a stop codon (like in option A or D).

Option C suggests proteolysis due to lack of linker. If the protein is made but quickly degraded, you might not see it. But the sequence suggests that the protein isn't even made because of a premature stop.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, the stop codon is TGA in the DNA (which would be UGA in mRNA). So the stop codon is UGA. But the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. So if the stop codon were UAA, but the tRNA for that doesn't exist, the ribosome wouldn't recognize it. But in this case, it's a UGA stop codon, which is recognized by release factors. So option D isn't the issue here.

So the problem is that there's a TGA stop codon in the construct, causing premature termination. That's probably because the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, introducing a frameshift or a mutation that added a stop codon.

Wait, but why would the HA sequence cause a stop codon? HA is a short peptide, but the construct is adding the HA coding sequence before GADD45G. If the HA was correctly inserted, it would be followed by the start codon of GADD45G. But in the sequence given, the ATG is the very first codon, then the HA coding sequence is added. But if the HA sequence includes a stop codon, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag wasn't properly inserted in frame, causing a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence itself has a TGA codon. Alternatively, the HA might have a stop codon in the middle, but that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, maybe the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift that introduces a stop codon. But the presence of a stop codon at position 12 suggests that the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Because the HA is a short tag, if the insertion wasn't in frame, it would cause a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

But another possibility is that the HA tag's coding sequence is incorrect, leading to a stop codon in the correct frame. For example, a mutation in the HA sequence might have introduced a TGA codon in the correct reading frame.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). So the HA sequence was intended to be at the beginning. HA's coding sequence should be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA for the first 11 codons (33 nucleotides), followed by the TGA stop, which is not part of the HA. So that would mean that the HA coding sequence was correctly inserted, but the TGA is in the middle of HA.

Wait, no, that can't be because HA is a peptide that shouldn't include a stop codon. So perhaps the HA sequence in the construct was not correctly inserted. Maybe the HA sequence was not added in frame, or there's a mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence isn't correctly added, leading to an early stop.

So, the HA sequence's coding region in the construct has a mutation, leading to a premature stop codon. So option A says the HA has a missense mutationâ€”so a single nucleotide change leading to an amino acid change. But the issue here is a stop codon, which is a nonsense mutation, not a missense. So option A doesn't explain the stop.

Wait, but the problem says the HA is introduced. The HA is usually a short peptide, so if the HA's coding sequence is messed up, perhaps the HA part includes a stop codon. So in the given sequence, after the HA, the GADD45G should start. But the stop codon is in the middle of the HA.

Wait, perhaps the HA should be 10 amino acids, so 30 nucleotides. The first 30 nucleotides of the construct after ATG should be the HA. Then the GADD45G starts. But in the given sequence, the first 12 codons (36 nucleotides) include a stop codon.

So perhaps the HA wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift. For example, if the HA insert added a number of nucleotides not divisible by three, causing a frameshift and introducing a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted correctly, but the researcher made a mistake in the sequence, adding a TGA in the middle.

Wait, let's think about the DNA sequence. The HA coding sequence starts right after ATG. HA's nucleotide sequence would be the coding sequence for the HA peptide. But if during cloning, a mistake was made, perhaps an extra base was inserted, causing a frameshift. Let's say the HA is 30 nucleotides, but due to a cloning error, it's 31, leading to a frameshift. Then the codons after that would be different, and perhaps a stop codon appears earlier than it should.

But in the given sequence, the first 36 nucleotides (12 codons) include a TGA. That could be a result of a frameshift, leading to a stop after HA.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was correctly inserted, but the construct has a mutation that introduced a TGA in the HA region.

Wait, the problem states that the reason is in the sequence. So looking at the sequence, the first codons after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. So the first 36 bases (12 codons) include the stop at position 36. The HA tag should be the first 10 amino acids, so 30 bases. So the HA sequence in the construct is actually longer, or perhaps includes the TGA. Since the HA shouldn't have a stop codon, perhaps the construct has an extra codon, or a mutation in the HA sequence that introduced a TGA.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, leading to a frameshift that causes a stop.

But looking at the sequence, after the HA would come the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA itself has a stop codon, then the GADD45G isn't even being expressed because the ribosome stops at TGA.

Therefore, the problem is that the HA sequence in the construct includes a premature stop codon, which is likely a result of a mutation in the HA coding sequence. So option A says the HA has a missense mutation, but that wouldn't introduce a stop codon. Alternatively, the HA might have a frameshift leading to a stop.

Wait, but the options don't mention a frameshift. The options are about point mutations or other issues.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the HA tag was added in the wrong reading frame, leading to a frameshift, which causes the ribosome to hit a stop codon. But I don't think that's one of the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: The HA has a missense mutation. That would be a point mutation resulting in an amino acid change, but not a stop.

Option B: The ribosome stops early. That's the effect, but why?

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA isn't present, perhaps the protein is being degraded by proteases because there's no HA tag for purification. But the problem is overexpression isn't happening, so the issue is likely at the expression level, not degradation.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But the stop is UGA, so D doesn't apply.

Wait, maybe the HA was added in the correct frame but the presence of a stop codon within the HA is causing the issue. If the HA sequence itself has a stop codon, that would be a problem. For example, HA's coding sequence might have a TGA, which the researcher didn't account for.

But HA's coding sequence shouldn't have a stop codon. So if the HA's DNA sequence was modified to introduce a TGA, that would be a mutation. So option A is about a missense mutation in the HA. But a missense mutation changes an amino acid, not introducing a stop. Unless the mutation changes a codon into a stop. For example, a nucleotide change that turns a codon into TGA.

Ah, yes! So a missense mutation in the HA sequence that changes a codon into a TGA would cause a premature stop. So option A would explain the presence of a TGA in the sequence.

Wait, but the HA sequence is provided as the correct sequence. Unless the HA had a mutation, introducing a TGA. So that would be a missense mutation if it changes the amino acid but also creates a stop. Or more accurately, it's a nonsense mutation.

But the options don't have a 'nonsense' option. So option A is the closest, as a missense mutation could include a change that introduces a stop if it's a synonymous or leads to a stop. Wait, no. Missense is an amino acid change without a stop. Nonsense is a stop. So option A isn't exactly correct because it's a stop, not a missense.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The construct has a stop codon after 12 codons, which is in the HA region. So the HA sequence in the construct has a stop codon. Why is that?

Possibility 1: The HA was correctly inserted, but a mutation introduced a TGA, causing a stop.

Possibility 2: The HA was not correctly inserted, leading to a frameshift and an early stop.

But none of the options directly address a frameshift. The options are A to D, which are about point mutations, translation termination, proteolysis, and tRNA absence.

Looking at option B: The ribosome terminated early. So the reason is the stop codon. So why is there a stop codon?

Is it because the HA's coding sequence has a mutation (option A) or because of some other reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence is correct, but the termination is due to the HA sequence causing a read-through into a cryptic promoter or something else. But that's probably not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: the HA is a tag, so the coding sequence should be followed by the GADD45G sequence. If the HA is correctly inserted, then the sequence after the HA should be the start of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, after the stop codon, there's more sequence. Let me look.

Looking at the given DNA sequence beyond the TGA stop:

After TGA comes CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CC GAA AGC A...

Wait, but the TGA is a stop codon, so the ribosome would terminate before reaching those codons. So the GADD45G isn't even being transcribed because the HA sequence has a stop.

So why is there a TGA in the HA sequence? Maybe the HA was inserted in reverse complement or something, but that's probably not. Or perhaps the HA's coding sequence has a mutation introducing a TGA.

So the conclusion is that the HA's coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a TGA, causing a premature stop. So the problem is that the HA has a mutation leading to a premature stop. But the options don't directly say that. Option A is about a missense mutation, which could include a stop if it's a base change leading to a stop codon.

But wait, a missense mutation changes a codon to another amino acid, but not to a stop. A nonsense mutation changes to a stop. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but the closest would be option A. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the HA is missing, leading the ribosome to not produce the HA and then not produce the GADD45G. But that doesn't fit with the sequence provided.

Wait, another possibility: the construct is missing the HA tag. But that's not the case here because the sequence starts with HA.

Wait, the other thing I noticed is that the HA sequence is followed by TGA. So the researcher intended to express the HA tag followed by GADD45G, but due to a mutation in the HA, a stop is introduced, so the GADD45G isn't made. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed.

So the issue is that the HA's coding sequence has a mutation leading to a premature stop codon. So the correct option would be that there's a missense mutation in the HA that leads to a stop codon. But since option A says 'missense', which refers to amino acid change, it's not exactly the same. Alternatively, perhaps the construct has a frameshift leading to an early stop. But the options don't mention that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the lack of linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag isn't present, the protein might be degraded. But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's expressed but degraded.

Option B suggests the ribosome stops early because of a stop codon. That's correct, but why is the stop codon there? Because of a mutation in HA.

So the root cause is that the HA sequence has a mutation introducing a stop codon. Since the options don't directly address this, perhaps option A is the intended answer. Because option A is about a mutation in the HA causing an amino acid change, but if that change happens to be a stop codon, then it's the cause.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was not added correctly, leading to a frameshift. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the plus strand has the HA in the correct orientation, but the TGA is part of the HA, which shouldn't be. So the HA's coding sequence is incorrect. So the HA has a mutation leading to a stop codon.

In that case, the correct answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation (which may have introduced a stop codon, but perhaps the question considers it a missense).

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is not followed by the GADD45G, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation, causing the TGA to be in the HA. But the sequence starts with ATG, so it's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial ATG is part of the HA, but the HA's coding sequence has a TGA stop codon. So the HA would be expressed, but then the construct would have a stop before GADD45G. So the GADD45G isn't expressed, leading to no overexpression.

So in that case, the problem is a premature stop in the HA sequence, which is why the GADD45G isn't overexpressed.

So, the correct reason is that the HA sequence includes a stop codon, which is a mutation. But the options don't directly say that. So the closest option is A: the HA has a missense mutation. Even though a missense is an amino acid change, but if that leads to a stop, then it's the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's stop codon is due to a frameshift, but that's not an option.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the HA wasn't added at all, but the GADD45G starts with ATG. Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of GADD45G. But that can't be right because HA should be at the N-terminus.

Wait, maybe the HA wasn't added, so the GADD45G is expressed without HA, but that wouldn't explain the stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the HA was added but in a way that introduced a stop.

I think the key is that the construct includes a TGA stop codon after 12 codons, which is in the HA region. So the HA's coding sequence is incorrect, perhaps due to a mutation that introduces a stop.

So the correct answer is A: the HA has a missense mutation. But wait, that's a point mutation leading to an amino acid change. But if the mutation changes a codon into TGA, which is a stop, then it's a nonsense mutation, not a missense. So maybe the intended answer is A, but perhaps the question assumes that a missense mutation could lead to a stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence is correct, but the GADD45G is not being expressed because the ribosome stops at TGA. So the reason is that the HA has a stop codon, but how? That would be a mutation in the HA.

So the correct answer is A.


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. However, the overexpression of the protein is not occurring, and the provided DNA sequence reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) at the 12th codon. This stop codon is located within the region encoding the HA tag, which was intended to be at the N-terminus of the construct. 

The HA tag is a short peptide that should not include a stop codon. The presence of the TGA stop codon suggests that there is an issue with the HA coding sequence. One possibility is that the HA sequence was introduced with a mutation, such as a missense mutation, which inadvertently changed a codon into a stop codon. This would result in the ribosome terminating translation prematurely, preventing the expression of the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation."  
  A missense mutation typically refers to a single nucleotide change that alters an amino acid. However, if the mutation changes a codon into a stop codon (e.g., TGA), it would result in a premature stop. While this is technically a nonsense mutation, the question likely intends for this option to encompass any mutation in the HA sequence that prevents proper expression, making this the most plausible answer.

- **Option B**: "The ribosome terminated the translation early."  
  This is an effect of the premature stop codon but does not explain why the stop codon is present. The question asks for the root cause, so this is not the correct answer.

- **Option C**: "The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain."  
  Proteolysis refers to the degradation of the protein after it is synthesized. However, the issue here is that the protein is not being expressed at all due to the premature stop codon, making this option irrelevant.

- **Option D**: "The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse."  
  The stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not UAA. Additionally, this option is unrelated to the observed premature stop codon in the HA region.

The most likely explanation is that the HA coding sequence contains a mutation, such as a missense mutation, which introduced the premature stop codon (TGA). This prevents the full-length HA-GADD45G fusion protein from being expressed, leading to the failure of overexpression. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
