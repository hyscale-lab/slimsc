Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by something like the amplitude times the angular frequency, but this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. Relativistic implies we have to use the relativistic equations of motion, probably involving the Lorentz factor or something with gamma. But wait, the question is about the maximum speed, so maybe I don't need to go into the full dynamics but just find the condition when the kinetic energy is maximum.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed would be when KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², leading to v² = (kA²)/m, so v = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). But that's the classical case, and this is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

But wait, the options have option C as sqrt(kA²/m), which is the classical answer, but in a relativistic context, that can't be correct because speeds can't approach c. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Oh, wait, the problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So maybe it's not the usual quantum harmonic oscillator, but a classical one, treated relativistically.

So in special relativity, the momentum and energy are different. The total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in a harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but I think here we're considering a classical relativistic oscillator.

Wait, no, the question is about the maximum speed, so maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy and kinetic energy oscillate, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is not just (1/2)mv². Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the motion using relativistic mechanics. The force is F = -kx, so the equation of motion would be relativistic; but I'm not sure about the exact form. Wait, in special relativity, the momentum is gamma m v, and F is d(p)/dt, which would be d(gamma m v)/dt.

So F = -k x, which is a conservative force, so potential energy is (1/2)k x². The total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c², which includes the rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. When it's at equilibrium (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So, the total energy when at maximum displacement is E = (1/2)k A² = gamma m c². Wait, but that can't be right, because when x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Hmm, maybe in relativistic cases, the potential energy isn't treated the same as in classical mechanics. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the energy in terms of the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, the total energy E should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x = A, it's at rest (v=0), so E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Wait, no, in the classical case, the potential is (1/2)k A², but in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential is different. Alternatively, perhaps the potential is the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this more carefully. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator, so the force is F = -k x, and we're to find the maximum speed.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. So, (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max^2. Solving gives v_max = sqrt(k A²/m), which is option C. But that's the non-relativistic case.

But since this is relativistic, that formula can't be correct because as speeds approach c, the relativistic effects become significant. So, perhaps the approach is to consider relativistic energy.

Wait, but when the oscillator is moving at maximum speed, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, but in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², which is potential at maximum displacement. So, in the relativistic case, when x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is mc² plus the potential energy (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy. So when x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Then when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is E = gamma m c² (since KE is relativistic, and the rest energy is already included in gamma).

Wait, that makes sense. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A² when x = A, v=0. And E = gamma m c² when x=0, v_max. Therefore, these two expressions must be equal because energy is conserved.

So,

gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2) k A²

Divide both sides by m:

gamma c² = c² + (1/2)(k A²)/m

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = [c² + (1/2)(k A²)/m ] / c²

= 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, that's

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplification. Let me call it term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + term)^2 )

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2

= [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2

Expand (1 + term)^2:

= 1 + 2 term + term^2 - 1 / denominator.

Wait, no, the numerator is (1 + term)^2 - 1.

Which is 1 + 2 term + term² - 1 = 2 term + term².

So,

v²/c² = (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2

But since term is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is a small quantity if A is small compared to c, but the problem doesn't specify, so we can't assume term is small.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is term (2 + term). Denominator is (1 + term)^2.

Wait, so,

v²/c² = term (2 + term) / (1 + term)^2

But term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2

Simplify numerator inside the brackets:

= [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] 

Which is [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * ( (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ]

= (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator inside the brackets is (1 + term )^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 

= (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together, v² is:

c^2 * [ numerator ] / denominator 

Wait, numerator is [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c^2 * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

Simplify the division:

= c^2 * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [4 m² c^4 ] * [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel.

So,

v² = c^2 * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ]

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me factor the denominator:

Denominator: 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4

Looks like a perfect square, because (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4. Yes, that's right.

So denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v² = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator inside the brackets:

= c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Wait, but 4 m c^2 + k A^2 is not the same as 2 m c^2 + k A^2. Hmm. Let me think.

Let me write 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out terms.

Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of (2 m c^2 + k A^2). Let me see.

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

So 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the numerator in terms of denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2

Let me denote B = 2 m c² + k A².

Then,

4 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² + (2 m c² + k A²) ) = B + 2 m c².

Wait, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

Wait, perhaps I should just leave it as is for now and see if I can find a way to express v_max in terms of the given options.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, no, let me look at each option.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no, the expression in option B is written as sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's go back. I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) 

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(gamma)^2 = 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

Which can be written as:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

The numerator is (1 + x )^2 -1, where x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is 1 + 2x + x^2 -1 = 2x + x² = x(2 +x )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2 

Where x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2+x) ) / (1+x ) 

Hmm. Let me compute the expression inside the sqrt.

x(2 +x ) = x(2 +x )

(1 +x )² = 1 + 2x +x²

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me compute sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 + x )

Wait, let me write x as [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

x(2 +x ) = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( 4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Wait, let me compute the square root part:

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) ) = [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 denominators will cancel with the denominator in the denominator.

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 ) * [2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 terms cancel.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but I don't see this expression matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2, but in our case, we have (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) in gamma.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, the expression under the square root isn't clear. Let me check option B's expression.

Option B is written as sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that would be sqrt( [ (1 - x )^{-1} + 1 ] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - x ) = (1 - x + 1 )/(1 - x ) = (2 - x)/(1 - x )

Hmm, but in our earlier v equation, we have v^2 = c^2 * x(2 +x )/(1 +x )^2.

Let me compute x(2 + x )/(1 + x )^2.

x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

x(2 +x ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= [2 k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] + [k^2 A^4/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

= [k A^2/(m c^2 ) ] + [k² A^4/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = 1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

= 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor x(2 +x ) = x (2 +x ) = x (2 +x ) = x(2 +x )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps we can relate this to the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me compute what's inside the square root:

1 + 1/(1 - x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is ( (1 - x ) + 1 ) / (1 - x ) ) = (2 -x )/(1 -x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) )

= c * sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

But in our earlier expression, v^2 is c^2 [x(2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2.

Hmm, let me compute [x(2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2.

x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

x(2 +x ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: (1 +x )^2 = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ numerator ] / denominator 

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) * c^2 / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me define y = k A²/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + y.

So,

gamma = 1 + y = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))

Then,

1/(1 + y ) = sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 + y )^2 = 1 - v²/c² 

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 = [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ]/(1 + y )^2 

= [1 + 2y + y² -1 ]/(1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y² )/(1 + y )^2 

= y (2 + y )/(1 + y )^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Now, substitute y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

y (2 + y ) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

And (1 + y )^2 = [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Simplify the numerator's square root:

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) = A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Denominator of the fraction inside the square root is 4 m² c^4, so sqrt of that is 2 m c^2.

So,

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) = [A sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A² )) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Now, the entire expression for v is:

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Simplify the division:

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 m c² / (2 m c² +k A² ) ]

The 2 m c² terms cancel out.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to match this expression. Let me look again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can write the expression for v in terms of hyperbolic functions or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when the speed is maximum, all the energy is kinetic, and then use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I should have written the equation:

gamma m c² = (1/2) k A² + m c²

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which gives 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

= [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

Expanding numerator:

= [ 1 + 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] 

= 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

And denominator is [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2 = same as earlier.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, this might be the same as the expression we had earlier.

Wait, but I'm trying to match this with the options. Let me see.

Option B says v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me compute the inside:

1 + 1/(1 - x ), x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is (1 - x + 1 )/(1 - x ) )= (2 - x )/(1 - x )

So,

sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 -x ) )

Hmm, not the same as our expression.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me express v_max in terms of gamma.

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is 1 + y, where y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + y

Then,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma ))^2 )

Wait, no, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Wait, no, wait:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

=> 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma^2

=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma^2

= (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2 

= ( (1 + y )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (1 + 2y + y^2 -1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Hmm. I'm not seeing a direct match with the options. Wait, let's consider each option.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute the term inside:

1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]

= [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2 

= (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 +x )^2 

= (2x +x² ) / (1 +x )^2 

Which is the same as our expression for v²/c².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = c * sqrt( (x (2 +x ) ) ) / (1 +x )

Which is the same as our earlier expression.

But option D's expression is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]) where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Which matches our calculation.

Wait, but in option D, the expression is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which is exactly our expression for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Wait, but looking at option D:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was option B. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express option D.

Option D is written as:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is the same as our expression. So that would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that with the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which gives v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma )^2 

Which is 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

So, yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but earlier when I looked at option B, that's where I thought I had an expression similar to something. But now I think I made a mistake.

So the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At maximum velocity (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic energy expression:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting this into the equation for \( \gamma \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) back into the equation:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly manipulate the denominator or fail to account for relativistic effects properly.
- **Option C** represents the classical result, which does not apply to relativistic dynamics.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by something like the amplitude times the angular frequency, but this is a relativistic case, so things are different.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. Relativistic implies we have to use the relativistic equations of motion, probably involving the Lorentz factor or something with gamma. But wait, the question is about the maximum speed, so maybe I don't need to go into the full dynamics but just find the condition when the kinetic energy is maximum.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed would be when KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA², leading to v² = (kA²)/m, so v = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). But that's the classical case, and this is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

But wait, the options have option C as sqrt(kA²/m), which is the classical answer, but in a relativistic context, that can't be correct because speeds can't approach c. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Oh, wait, the problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So maybe it's not the usual quantum harmonic oscillator, but a classical one, treated relativistically.

So in special relativity, the momentum and energy are different. The total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in a harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but I think here we're considering a classical relativistic oscillator.

Wait, no, the question is about the maximum speed, so maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy and kinetic energy oscillate, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is not just (1/2)mv². Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the motion using relativistic mechanics. The force is F = -kx, so the equation of motion would be relativistic; but I'm not sure about the exact form. Wait, in special relativity, the momentum is gamma m v, and F is d(p)/dt, which would be d(gamma m v)/dt.

So F = -k x, which is a conservative force, so potential energy is (1/2)k x². The total energy E would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma m c², which includes the rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. When it's at equilibrium (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So, the total energy when at maximum displacement is E = (1/2)k A² = gamma m c². Wait, but that can't be right, because when x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Hmm, maybe in relativistic cases, the potential energy isn't treated the same as in classical mechanics. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the energy in terms of the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, the total energy E should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x = A, it's at rest (v=0), so E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Wait, no, in the classical case, the potential is (1/2)k A², but in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential is different. Alternatively, perhaps the potential is the same, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this more carefully. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator, so the force is F = -k x, and we're to find the maximum speed.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. So, (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max^2. Solving gives v_max = sqrt(k A²/m), which is option C. But that's the non-relativistic case.

But since this is relativistic, that formula can't be correct because as speeds approach c, the relativistic effects become significant. So, perhaps the approach is to consider relativistic energy.

Wait, but when the oscillator is moving at maximum speed, x=0, so the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, but in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)k A², which is potential at maximum displacement. So, in the relativistic case, when x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is mc² plus the potential energy (1/2)k A².

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy. So when x = A, the velocity is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A². Then when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is E = gamma m c² (since KE is relativistic, and the rest energy is already included in gamma).

Wait, that makes sense. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A² when x = A, v=0. And E = gamma m c² when x=0, v_max. Therefore, these two expressions must be equal because energy is conserved.

So,

gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2) k A²

Divide both sides by m:

gamma c² = c² + (1/2)(k A²)/m

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = [c² + (1/2)(k A²)/m ] / c²

= 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Wait, that's

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplification. Let me call it term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + term)^2 )

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2

= [ (1 + term)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + term)^2

Expand (1 + term)^2:

= 1 + 2 term + term^2 - 1 / denominator.

Wait, no, the numerator is (1 + term)^2 - 1.

Which is 1 + 2 term + term² - 1 = 2 term + term².

So,

v²/c² = (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2

But since term is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is a small quantity if A is small compared to c, but the problem doesn't specify, so we can't assume term is small.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me factor the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is term (2 + term). Denominator is (1 + term)^2.

Wait, so,

v²/c² = term (2 + term) / (1 + term)^2

But term = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v² = c² [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2

Simplify numerator inside the brackets:

= [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] 

Which is [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * ( (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) ]

= (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator inside the brackets is (1 + term )^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 

= (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting it all together, v² is:

c^2 * [ numerator ] / denominator 

Wait, numerator is [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v² = c^2 * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ (4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

Simplify the division:

= c^2 * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [4 m² c^4 ] * [4 m² c^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel.

So,

v² = c^2 * [k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) ] / [4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ]

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let me factor the denominator:

Denominator: 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4

Looks like a perfect square, because (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4. Yes, that's right.

So denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So,

v² = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator inside the brackets:

= c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Wait, but 4 m c^2 + k A^2 is not the same as 2 m c^2 + k A^2. Hmm. Let me think.

Let me write 4 m c^2 as 2*(2 m c^2). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out terms.

Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of (2 m c^2 + k A^2). Let me see.

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2 = 4 m c^2 + k A^2.

So 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) + 2 m c^2.

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the numerator in terms of denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can write:

v² = c² * [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)] / (2 m c² + k A²)^2

Let me denote B = 2 m c² + k A².

Then,

4 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² + (2 m c² + k A²) ) = B + 2 m c².

Wait, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

Wait, perhaps I should just leave it as is for now and see if I can find a way to express v_max in terms of the given options.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, no, let me look at each option.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no, the expression in option B is written as sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's go back. I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) 

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(gamma)^2 = 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

Which can be written as:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

The numerator is (1 + x )^2 -1, where x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is 1 + 2x + x^2 -1 = 2x + x² = x(2 +x )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ x (2 + x) ] / (1 + x )^2 

Where x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2+x) ) / (1+x ) 

Hmm. Let me compute the expression inside the sqrt.

x(2 +x ) = x(2 +x )

(1 +x )² = 1 + 2x +x²

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me compute sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 + x )

Wait, let me write x as [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

x(2 +x ) = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( 4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Wait, let me compute the square root part:

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) ) = [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 denominators will cancel with the denominator in the denominator.

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 ) * [2 m c^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

The 2 m c^2 terms cancel.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, but I don't see this expression matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2, but in our case, we have (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) in gamma.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, the expression under the square root isn't clear. Let me check option B's expression.

Option B is written as sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that would be sqrt( [ (1 - x )^{-1} + 1 ] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1 + 1/(1 - x ) = (1 - x + 1 )/(1 - x ) = (2 - x)/(1 - x )

Hmm, but in our earlier v equation, we have v^2 = c^2 * x(2 +x )/(1 +x )^2.

Let me compute x(2 + x )/(1 + x )^2.

x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

x(2 +x ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

= [2 k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) ) ] + [k^2 A^4/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

= [k A^2/(m c^2 ) ] + [k² A^4/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = 1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

= 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(m c^2 )) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor x(2 +x ) = x (2 +x ) = x (2 +x ) = x(2 +x )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Another approach: perhaps we can relate this to the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me compute what's inside the square root:

1 + 1/(1 - x ), where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is ( (1 - x ) + 1 ) / (1 - x ) ) = (2 -x )/(1 -x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) )

= c * sqrt( (2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

But in our earlier expression, v^2 is c^2 [x(2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2.

Hmm, let me compute [x(2 +x ) ]/(1 +x )^2.

x= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

x(2 +x ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator: (1 +x )^2 = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ numerator ] / denominator 

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]/(4 m² c^4 ) * c^2 / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me define y = k A²/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + y.

So,

gamma = 1 + y = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²))

Then,

1/(1 + y ) = sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 + y )^2 = 1 - v²/c² 

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 = [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ]/(1 + y )^2 

= [1 + 2y + y² -1 ]/(1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y² )/(1 + y )^2 

= y (2 + y )/(1 + y )^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Now, substitute y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

y (2 + y ) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

= [ k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

And (1 + y )^2 = [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 

So,

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Simplify the numerator's square root:

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) = A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Denominator of the fraction inside the square root is 4 m² c^4, so sqrt of that is 2 m c^2.

So,

sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) = [A sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A² )) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Now, the entire expression for v is:

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] / [ (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Simplify the division:

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] * [ 2 m c² / (2 m c² +k A² ) ]

The 2 m c² terms cancel out.

So,

v = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )

Hmm, but none of the options seem to match this expression. Let me look again.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can write the expression for v in terms of hyperbolic functions or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when the speed is maximum, all the energy is kinetic, and then use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So perhaps I should have written the equation:

gamma m c² = (1/2) k A² + m c²

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which gives 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

= [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 

Expanding numerator:

= [ 1 + 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] 

= 2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

And denominator is [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2 = same as earlier.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

Hmm, this might be the same as the expression we had earlier.

Wait, but I'm trying to match this with the options. Let me see.

Option B says v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me compute the inside:

1 + 1/(1 - x ), x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is (1 - x + 1 )/(1 - x ) )= (2 - x )/(1 - x )

So,

sqrt( (2 - x )/(1 -x ) )

Hmm, not the same as our expression.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me express v_max in terms of gamma.

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Which is 1 + y, where y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + y

Then,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma ))^2 )

Wait, no, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Wait, no, wait:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

=> 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma^2

=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma^2

= (gamma^2 -1 ) / gamma^2 

= ( (1 + y )^2 - 1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (1 + 2y + y^2 -1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y² ) / (1 + y )^2 

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

Hmm. I'm not seeing a direct match with the options. Wait, let's consider each option.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute the term inside:

1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]

= [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2 

= (1 + 2x + x² -1 ) / (1 +x )^2 

= (2x +x² ) / (1 +x )^2 

Which is the same as our expression for v²/c².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = c * sqrt( (x (2 +x ) ) ) / (1 +x )

Which is the same as our earlier expression.

But option D's expression is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ]) where x = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x^2 )/(1 +x )^2 ) = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Which matches our calculation.

Wait, but in option D, the expression is sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which is exactly our expression for v/c.

So, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Wait, but looking at option D:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly what we have.

So the correct option is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was option B. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express option D.

Option D is written as:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is the same as our expression. So that would be correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that with the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which gives v²/c² = 1 - 1/(gamma )^2 

Which is 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 

So, yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but earlier when I looked at option B, that's where I thought I had an expression similar to something. But now I think I made a mistake.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator, we start by considering energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At maximum velocity (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic energy expression:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting this into the equation for \( \gamma \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + x}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) back into the equation:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** incorrectly manipulate the denominator or fail to account for relativistic effects properly.
- **Option C** represents the classical result, which does not apply to relativistic dynamics.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
