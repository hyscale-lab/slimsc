Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution—does that mean the same number of stars in any region of the sky? But wait, I'm a bit confused because when we talk about parallax, that relates to distance, right?

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, actually, it's plx = 1/d when d is in parsecs. So higher plx means closer star.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they’re asking for the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax. Let me think about this in terms of volume.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars depends on the volume of the space they occupy. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distances would be from d to d + dd, where dd is a small change. Because plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So as plx increases, d decreases.

But wait, let's model this. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)πr³. So for stars at a distance d, the volume up to that distance would be (4/3)πd³. But when we're considering stars in a shell between d and d + dd, the volume is (4/3)π(d + dd)^3 - (4/3)πd^3 ≈ 4πd² dd when dd is small.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about how the number of stars in a given parallax interval depends on plx.

So, first, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the surface area of that shell times the thickness. Surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So stars in that shell: N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since the distribution is uniform, n is constant.

But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, which means dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = (d plx) * (d plx) squared? Hmm, maybe I should express dd in terms of d plx.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. The derivative of 1/plx is -1/(plx)^2. So dd = (-1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell around distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (-1/(plx^2)) d plx, but since we're considering positive intervals, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) ) → Wait, substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( ( -1/(plx^2) ) d plx )

Wait, but I'm considering a small increase in plx, so d plx is positive. The negative from the derivative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the number of stars in a shell at distance d would depend on d² times the thickness in d, which becomes a function of plx.

Wait, perhaps I should express N in terms of plx. So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/(plx^2)) d plx )

Wait, no. Let's compute it properly.

d = 1/plx → dd = d(plx) * (-1/plx²)

Wait, the number of stars in the shell is:

N = n * 4π d² * dd

Because the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx² )

Wait, because dd = (d plx) * ( -1/plx² )

So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx² )

But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, so the shell moves inward. Since we're interested in the number per unit plx, the absolute value would matter.

So, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx² )

Simplify that:

N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 )

Wait, 1/plx^2 * 1/plx^2 is 1/plx^4? Wait, no:

Wait, (1/plx)^2 is 1/plx², and the dd is (d plx) * (-1/plx²) → so 1/plx² times d plx.

So, N = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx² )

Which is,

N = n * 4π * (d plx) / plx^4.

But N is the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) → so per d plx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought this would be a different result. Because when I think about it, the number per unit plx would drop off with plx^-4? Hmm.

But wait, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd). So N = 4πd² dd n.

But since parallax is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = -d (d plx) → because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → so dd = -d² d plx.

Substituting d = 1/plx, we get:

dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx) ) * n

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is positive. So,

N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 )

Which is,

N = (n * 4π) * (d plx) / plx^4.

So, N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx (N) is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but that would mean as plx increases, the number of stars in that plx interval drops off more rapidly. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, when plx is small, meaning stars are far away, the number should be fewer, but perhaps the rate of decrease is steeper.

Wait, but the options are about how the number of stars per unit plx changes with plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx interval decreases as 1/plx^4.

But looking back at the options:

A) ~1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~1/plx^1

D) ~1/plx^3

So the correct answer would be A) ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that in a uniform distribution, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So let's think about the number of stars in a given parallax range. So perhaps my initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try a different approach.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dd, as before.

But since plx = 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx. So,

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx² )

Which simplifies to (ignoring the negative sign as we're considering absolute values):

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 ) = n * 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So N is proportional to (d plx) / plx^4 → which is the same as saying N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, N is the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax d plx. So the number per unit parallax (d plx) is N/(d plx) ) = (n *4π / plx^4 ). So that's the number of stars per unit plx. Which is how the question is phrased.

So the number per unit plx (d plx) is indeed proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the answer should be option A) ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness \( dd \). Thus, the number of stars \( N \) in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume).

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The thickness \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) is obtained from the derivative:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{-1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{-1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, \( d \) decreases, but the magnitude of the number of stars per unit \( \text{plx} \) is:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **A) ~1/\(\text{plx}^4\):** Correct, as derived above.
- **B) ~1/\(\text{plx}^2\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.
- **C) ~1/\(\text{plx}^1\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.
- **D) ~1/\(\text{plx}^3\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger.

The correct answer is **A) ~1/\(\text{plx}^4\)**.

So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, actually, it's plx = 1/d when d is in parsecs. So higher plx means closer star.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they’re asking for the relationship between the number of stars and the parallax. Let me think about this in terms of volume.

In a uniform distribution, the number of stars depends on the volume of the space they occupy. For a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distances would be from d to d + dd, where dd is a small change. Because plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. So as plx increases, d decreases.

But wait, let's model this. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)πr³. So for stars at a distance d, the volume up to that distance would be (4/3)πd³. But when we're considering stars in a shell between d and d + dd, the volume is (4/3)π(d + dd)^3 - (4/3)πd^3 ≈ 4πd² dd when dd is small.

Wait, but I'm looking for the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about how the number of stars in a given parallax interval depends on plx.

So, first, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the surface area of that shell times the thickness. Surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dd. So stars in that shell: N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since the distribution is uniform, n is constant.

But plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, which means dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by dd = (d plx) * (d plx) squared? Hmm, maybe I should express dd in terms of d plx.

Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. The derivative of 1/plx is -1/(plx)^2. So dd = (-1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell around distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (-1/(plx^2)) d plx, but since we're considering positive intervals, maybe I can ignore the negative sign for now.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) ) → Wait, substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( ( -1/(plx^2) ) d plx )

Wait, but I'm considering a small increase in plx, so d plx is positive. The negative from the derivative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the number of stars in a shell at distance d would depend on d² times the thickness in d, which becomes a function of plx.

Wait, perhaps I should express N in terms of plx. So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/(plx^2)) d plx )

Wait, no. Let's compute it properly.

d = 1/plx → dd = d(plx) * (-1/plx²)

Wait, the number of stars in the shell is:

N = n * 4π d² * dd

Because the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx² )

Wait, because dd = (d plx) * ( -1/plx² )

So,

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - d plx / plx² )

But the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, so the shell moves inward. Since we're interested in the number per unit plx, the absolute value would matter.

So, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx² )

Simplify that:

N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 )

Wait, 1/plx^2 * 1/plx^2 is 1/plx^4? Wait, no:

Wait, (1/plx)^2 is 1/plx², and the dd is (d plx) * (-1/plx²) → so 1/plx² times d plx.

So, N = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx² )

Which is,

N = n * 4π * (d plx) / plx^4.

But N is the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) → so per d plx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I thought this would be a different result. Because when I think about it, the number per unit plx would drop off with plx^-4? Hmm.

But wait, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd). So N = 4πd² dd n.

But since parallax is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, and dd = -d (d plx) → because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd → so dd = -d² d plx.

Substituting d = 1/plx, we get:

dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx) ) * n

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is positive. So,

N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 )

Which is,

N = (n * 4π) * (d plx) / plx^4.

So, N is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx (N) is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

Wait, but that would mean as plx increases, the number of stars in that plx interval drops off more rapidly. But wait, is that correct?

N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2 ) = n * 4π (d plx) / plx^4.

So N is proportional to (d plx) / plx^4 → which is the same as saying N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait, N is the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax d plx. So the number per unit parallax (d plx) is N/(d plx) ) = (n *4π / plx^4 ). So that's the number of stars per unit plx. Which is how the question is phrased.

So the number per unit plx (d plx) is indeed proportional to 1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness \( dd \). Thus, the number of stars \( N \) in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd,
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume).

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The thickness \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) is obtained from the derivative:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{-1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{-1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, \( d \) decreases, but the magnitude of the number of stars per unit \( \text{plx} \) is:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided:
