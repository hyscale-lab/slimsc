Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, in this case, the problem says the atoms are twice as excited. So that ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Let me double-check.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, I think that means the population of the excited state (upper level) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, if I denote the populations as n1 and n2, then n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the excited to ground state that's twice? I need to get that straight.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the populations is given. Let's say for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 * (n_upper'/(n_lower')) for star_2. Wait, no. The problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, no. The exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher, meaning the population in the excited state is higher relative to the ground state. So if star_1 has more excited, then n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is higher than that for star_2.

So, for star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

But wait, not necessarily. Because it's the relative excitation, it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let's define R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower and R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower. Then the problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), then R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So, R1 / R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me see. Because when you divide the two exponentials, you subtract the exponents: exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b). So:

R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, no. Let's compute the exponents:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Then, R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But wait, R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2 → R1/R2 = 2.

So, 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me write it again. Because R1 = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = (g) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)), so R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )? No, wait, let me compute it correctly:

R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, let me factor that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So yes, ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but in the equation, ΔE is in the numerator. So perhaps we can write:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k T1 T2)] (T2 - T1) )

Wait, let me manipulate the equation. Let me take the equation from earlier:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me rearrange 1/T2 - 1/T1.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see any with ΔE or k in them. So perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio R1/R2 is 2, and we have to relate T1 and T2 without any constants, but the options are given in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J, but perhaps that's a red herring because in the equation, ΔE cancels out when considering the ratio. Wait, no, because the equation as it stands includes ΔE. But the options don't include ΔE, so perhaps the equation is rearranged.

Wait, but the question is to find the equation for the effective temperatures, so perhaps we can write the equation involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let me go back. We have:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the options have ln(2) equal to some expression involving T1 and T2. Let's see the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But in our equation, it's ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm. But the options don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps the given energy difference is 1.38e-23 J and k is the Boltzmann constant. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1 K.

Then, the equation becomes:

ln(2) = [1 K ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the equation. Hence, the correct option is D.

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the problem specifies that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}}}{\frac{n'_{\text{upper}}}{n'_{\text{lower}}}} = 2,
\]

where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the ratios for star_1 and star_2, respectively. Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star, we get:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, let me factor that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ]

So yes, ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the problem specifies that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that in star_2, the ratio of the populations in the excited state to the ground state is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}}}{\frac{n'_{\text{upper}}}{n'_{\text{lower}}}} = 2,
\]

where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the ratios for star_1 and star_2, respectively. Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star, we get:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 2 \), we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
