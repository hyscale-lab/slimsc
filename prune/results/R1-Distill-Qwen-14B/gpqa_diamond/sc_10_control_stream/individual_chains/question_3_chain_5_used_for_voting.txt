Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. 

Wait, the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh, right, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. 

The operator we're supposed to find the expectation value for is 10σz + 5σx. Oh wait, expectation value of an operator... right, the expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So for our operator O, which is 10σz +5σx, the expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each term.

I think I can break this into two parts: expect(10σz) and expect(5σx). Then add them together.

First, let's compute the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is easier. The state is a linear combination, so the expectation value would be the sum of the squares of the coefficients multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, σz acting on |↑⟩ gives +1 times |↑⟩, right? And σz acting on |↓⟩ gives -1 times |↓⟩. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

The state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let's square their magnitudes.

Wait, the state must be normalized. Let me check. The sum of the squares should be 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) → 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, that's normalized.

So the expectation value of σz is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. 0.25*(+1) is 0.25, plus (3/4)*(-1) is -0.75. So 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next, the expectation value of σx. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Because σx is not diagonal in the σz basis. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its matrix representation is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when you apply σx to |↑⟩ or |↓⟩, you get each other. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for expectation value. Let me write the state as a vector to make it easier.

The state ψ is a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is the first basis vector and |↓⟩ is the second, the state ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when you compute ψ† σx ψ, that's the expectation value of σx.

Wait, let me compute that. The matrix multiplication is:

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Multiplying by σx gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the product is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2).

Each term is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because ψ is a column vector, the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. So:

ψ† = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]

Multiply by σx: [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1, 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]

Then multiply by ψ: which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So matrix multiplication is:

First element: (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 → sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330

Second element: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) → same as first term, 0.4330

So sum is 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660. So yeah, that's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Then 5σx expectation is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Adding the two parts: 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives approx +4.33. So total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, right. So 5 * 0.866 is about 4.33.

So -5 +4.33 is -0.67. Hmm. So the expectation value is approximately -0.67. The options are given to one decimal place.

Looking at the options: A is -1.4, B is 1.65, C is -0.7, D is 0.85.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the σx expectation value. Let me think again. Because sometimes when I do these things quickly, I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is using the relation that for a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx is given by 2*(a*b* + b*a), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I think I need to think again.

Wait, another approach. The expectation value of σx is given by (ψ† σx ψ). Let me write ψ as a column vector [a, b]^T, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

So σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx ψ is [b, a]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So that's correct.

So yes, the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2. So 5*σx would be 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding that to the 10σz expectation value of -5, the total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but again, the options don't have -0.67. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

Wait, the closest would be option C) -0.7, but wait, let me compute more precisely.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, so sqrt(3)/2 is 0.8660254.

So 5 * 0.8660254 is approximately 4.330127.

Then 10σz part: 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

So total expectation is -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67. So to one decimal place, that's -0.7, right? Because 0.669873 is closer to 0.67, which is 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places. But the question says up to one decimal place.

Wait, wait. Let me think: -0.67 is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place? No, wait, 0.67 is 0.7 to one decimal place? No, wait. 0.67 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Wait, yes, because 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6. Wait, no, wait: 0.67 is two decimal places. When rounding to one decimal place, the first decimal is 6, the second is 7, which is ≥5, so you round up. So 0.67 becomes 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer should be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recheck the calculation of the σz expectation value again. Because I'm a bit confused.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. The expectation of σz is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4=0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct. So 10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

And the σx expectation is sqrt(3)/2, so 5σx's expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33= -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

But wait, the question states that the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, so that's (-5) + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 5*(1.732)/2 is (5*1.732)/2 = 8.66/2=4.33. So yes, that's correct.

So the total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7. So the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the state is written as a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T, so when I compute ψ† σx ψ, is that correct?

Wait, let's do it step by step with matrices. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx acting on ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† (σx ψ) is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the expectation value is -0.67, which is -0.7 to one decimal. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is normalized, and the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Squaring the coefficients:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The contribution to the expectation value from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Writing \( \psi \) as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Now, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The contribution to the expectation value from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, \( \langle O \rangle \approx -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( -0.7 \) is **C**.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next, the expectation value of σx. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Because σx is not diagonal in the σz basis. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, let me compute that. The matrix multiplication is:

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Multiplying by σx gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the product is (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 + (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2).

Each term is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because ψ is a column vector, the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. So:

ψ† = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]

Multiply by σx: [0.5*0 + (sqrt(3)/2)*1, 0.5*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]

Then multiply by ψ: which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So matrix multiplication is:

First element: (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 → sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330

Second element: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) → same as first term, 0.4330

So sum is 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660. So yeah, that's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. Then 5σx expectation is 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

Adding the two parts: 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives approx +4.33. So total expectation is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, right. So 5 * 0.866 is about 4.33.

So σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx ψ is [b, a]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ is a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So that's correct.

So yes, the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2. So 5*σx would be 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5*0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding that to the 10σz expectation value of -5, the total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but again, the options don't have -0.67. Let me check the options again.

Then 10σz part: 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

So total expectation is -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873, which is approximately -0.67. So to one decimal place, that's -0.7, right? Because 0.669873 is closer to 0.67, which is 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places. But the question says up to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recheck the calculation of the σz expectation value again. Because I'm a bit confused.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. The expectation of σz is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

So |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4=0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct. So 10σz's expectation is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

And the σx expectation is sqrt(3)/2, so 5σx's expectation is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈4.33.

So sum is -5 +4.33= -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

But wait, the question states that the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Wait, so that's (-5) + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 5*(1.732)/2 is (5*1.732)/2 = 8.66/2=4.33. So yes, that's correct.

So the total is -5 +4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7. So the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the state is written as a column vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T, so when I compute ψ† σx ψ, is that correct?

Wait, let's do it step by step with matrices. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx acting on ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† (σx ψ) is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the expectation value is -0.67, which is -0.7 to one decimal. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The state \( \psi \) is normalized, and the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Squaring the coefficients:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]
The contribution to the expectation value from \( 10\sigma_z \) is:
\[
10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10(-0.5) = -5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Writing \( \psi \) as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]
we compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Now, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]
The contribution to the expectation value from \( 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
