Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, and then asks about the chromatograms when the products are combined and run on different HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction step by step.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but since the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one. So, the structure is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Hmm, wait, noâ€” the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So position 3 is the ketone, and position 5 has a methoxy group.

So, the molecule is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group? Wait, no, the S designation is for the chiral center. So the molecule must have a chiral center at C5, which has a methoxy group, a hydrogen (since it's a hexan-3-one, so positions 1-6), so at C5, the groups would be: CH2CH2CH3 (from C6 maybe?), CH2CH2OCH3, and another group. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: hexan-3-one would have the carbonyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, more accurately, it's CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's (CH2)2C=O-(CH2)3CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's:

Structure: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hexane is six carbons. So 3-ketone would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that can't be because that would be 3-pentanone, but wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? That would be 6 carbons. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Hexan-3-one:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3.

But wait, the molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So at position 5, which is the fifth carbon, there's a methoxy group attached. So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, because if it's 5-methoxy, then the substituent is on carbon 5. So, carbon 5 is CH2, but with a methoxy group attached? Wait, no, carbon 5 would be attached to the oxygen. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let's move forward.

Reaction I: treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone (position 3) becomes a secondary alcohol. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you get the corresponding secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, so yes, the product would be a secondary alcohol. Also, the configuration at the chiral center (carbon 5) is (S). So when we reduce the ketone, does the configuration at C5 change? No, because the reduction is at C3. So C5's configuration remains S.

So, after Reaction I, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. I think that's correct.

Then, after LAH treatment, there's an acidic workup. But I'm not sure if that affects anything. Maybe it protonates any remaining groups, but the main product is the secondary alcohol.

So Reaction I gives one compound: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH, I think. Wait, structure is CH2(COCH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)CH2COCH3? No, wait, pentane would have five carbons. Let me think: positions 2 and 4 have ketone groups.

So structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 2,4-pentanedione. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Yes, that's correct. So two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Now, when treated with NaBH4. Normally, NaBH4 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LAH, but it can reduce ketones. However, when a compound has two ketone groups, like 2,4-pentanedione, the situation is different.

Wait, NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides, but in this case, it's only ketones. So treating 2,4-pentanedione with NaBH4 would reduce each ketone to a secondary alcohol.

So, each C=O becomes a CH(OH). But wait, with excess NaBH4, both ketones would be reduced. So the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-? No, the structure is more like CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, when each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be CH3-C(OH)-CH2-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that would give us a diol, specifically 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so after reduction with excess NaBH4, both are reduced. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol: CH3CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3.

But wait, considering the stereochemistry. Each reduction can proceed with either the R or S configuration, but since the starting material is symmetrical, the product might form a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 2,4-pentanedione, which is symmetrical. Because the two ketone groups are on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric due to the central CH2 group.

So when reducing each ketone, each would form an alcohol. Let's think about the reduction.

When NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it adds the hydride to the carbonyl carbon. In the case of a symmetrical ketone (like acetone), the reduction doesn't create any new chiral centers because the molecule is symmetric. But in pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is on a different carbon. Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric, so each ketone is in a mirror-image position. So when each ketone is reduced, the resulting OH groups could end up in the same or opposite configurations.

Wait, but wait, if the two ketones are symmetrical, then the product would have two chiral centers, but they would be either both R, both S, or one R and one S. But wait, in this case, because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would either be on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, but the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. So when NaBH4 is used, will the reduction of each ketone lead to a specific configuration? Or will it lead to a racemic mixture?

Wait, NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, NaBH4 is a chiral source? No, wait, no, NaBH4 is achiral, so when it reduces a prochiral ketone, it may form a racemic mixture. But in a symmetrical ketone, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

In the case of a single ketone, like acetone (prochiral), NaBH4 reduces it to a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) secondary alcohols. But if the ketone is part of a symmetrical molecule, like pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical around the central carbon, then when each ketone is reduced, the resulting diol may have internal planes of symmetry.

Wait, so when the first ketone is reduced, say on C2, the hydride adds to C2, giving a single configuration (R or S). Then the same happens on C4. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be in a specific configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the product is meso.

Wait, perhaps I need to draw the structure. So pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, correction: the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no, that's 2,4-pentanedione. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So each ketone is on a CH2 group. Hmm, wait, no. Let me correct: the structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH3? No, that can't be, because that would be four carbons. Wait, no.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione: the parent chain is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketones. So the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CH2)COCH3. No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C(=O)

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C(=O)

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain. So the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be four carbons because:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3 has five carbons: positions 1 (O=C-), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (C(=O)), 5 (CH3). So, it's pentane-2,4-dione.

So when both ketones are reduced with NaBH4, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So after reduction, each O=C becomes O-H. So the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. So it's 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry. Each CH2 group with OH was originally a ketone, so each was a CH2 in the diketone. When reduced, each becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, does each reduction create a new chiral center?

Wait, in the diketone, each ketone is on a CH2 group. So each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two identical groups. Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Each ketone is on a CH2 group. So when each CH2-C(=O) is reduced, the resulting CH2-CH(OH) groups. Wait, but wait, no: the structure is:

Original ketone group: (CH2)2-C(=O)-. No, wait, perhaps each ketone is on a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each ketone is on a central CH2 group. Let me think of the molecule as:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So each ketone is on a CH2 group, but the central CH2 is between the two ketones. So when each ketone is reduced, the CH2 becomes CH(OH), but in which configuration?

Wait, since the two ketones are symmetrical, perhaps each reduction leads to the same configuration, leading to either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, in the product, 2,4-pentanediol, the molecule would have two chiral centers at C2 and C4.

If both OH groups are on the same side, the molecule may be a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, if both OHs are on the same side, the molecule would be achiral (meso).

Alternatively, if the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule would have two chiral centers leading to a pair of enantiomers. But wait, with excess NaBH4, which is a strong enough reducing agent but not necessarily stereoselective beyond providing both possible configurations.

Wait, but NaBH4 is not a chiral reagent, so when it reduces each ketone, it could produce both R and S configurations. However, in the case of a symmetrical diketone, the product may be a racemic mixture, but perhaps in this case, due to the symmetry, it ends up as a single meso compound.

Wait, no, because when each ketone is reduced, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to R or S configuration. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two OHs could end up in a way that the molecule is meso, meaning the overall compound is achiral.

Wait, let me think of a simpler example. Take 2,3-dihydroxybutane (erythrose and threose), but in this case, it's 2,4-pentanediol. Wait, but pentane-2,4-diol would have the structure HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product of pentane-2,4-dione reduction would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Each OH is on a CH2 group, but wait, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 2,4-pentanediol. Now, each of the two CH2 groups with OH is a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because each CH2-OH is connected to two CH2 groups and an OH and the rest.

Wait, actually, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the carbons with OH are C2 and C4. So, C2: attached to CH3 (C1), CH2OH (C3?), and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it again.

Wait, the molecule would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's 2,4-pentanediol. So each of the second and fourth carbons have OH groups attached. Wait, no, because the positions are 2 and 4 in the pentane chain.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

No, that's six carbons. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, meaning it has two chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. So, the product would have two OH groups, but arranged symmetrically. Therefore, the product would be a single compound, a meso form, which is achiral.

But wait, when NaBH4 is used to reduce a symmetrical diketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, the product is a single meso diol. Because the reduction of each ketone leads to the same configuration on each side, due to the symmetry. So, the molecule would be meso, meaning it's superimposable on its mirror image, thus having no net chirality.

So, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, it's a single compound with two stereocenters but achiral.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the reduction. Each ketone is on a CH2 group, so when NaBH4 reduces each, each CH2 becomes CH(OH). Now, the configuration of each OH would depend on the approach of the hydride. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would end up either both on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps when each ketone is reduced, the OHs are added on the same face, leading to a meso compound. Because the molecule is symmetrical, any such configuration would result in the same overall structure.

So, Reaction II gives a single product: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, and if it's a meso compound, then it's a single compound, so in the reaction, only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 50:50 mixture of R,R and S,S, which would be a racemic mixture. But wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical, so the R,R and S,S would be identical in that case, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, no, because if the molecule is symmetrical, R,R would be the same as S,S, or no, wait, no. Let me think about it.

In meso compounds, the molecule has multiple stereocenters but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. For 2,4-pentanediol, if the two OHs are on the same side, the molecule would be a meso form. Because if you mirror the molecule along the central plane, it would look the same.

So, for pentane-2,4-diol, if the OHs are on the same side, the molecule is meso, which is a single compound. But if they're on opposite sides, it would be a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S), which would be two enantiomeric pairs, but in reality, they'd form two distinct compounds. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in a symmetrical molecule, if each stereocenter is R, and due to the symmetry, the other would also be R, but that would create a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me take a simpler example. Take tartaric acid: the meso form has two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, so the molecule is achiral. So in our case, if the two OHs are on the same face, the molecule would be a meso form, and thus a single compound.

So, in this case, the product of Reaction II is a single meso compound, so only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps each ketone is reduced independently, and the two OHs could be in either configuration, but due to the symmetry, they end up being a single compound.

So now, putting it all together.

After Reaction I and II, the products are:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single compound).

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (a single compound).

So, when these two products are combined, the mixture has two compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Reaction I produces one compound, and Reaction II produces another compound. So when combined, the mixture has two distinct compounds.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "the products from both reactions are combined." So each reaction produces a single compound. So the combined mixture has two compounds.

Now, when running these on an HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase and a normal-phase column, how many peaks would they show.

First, for the normal-phase HPLC: it's based on the polarity of the compounds. The stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. Compounds with higher polarity will elute later (retained longer) because they interact more with the stationary phase.

The two compounds are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group. It's a single enantiomer, so in normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

2. Meso-2,4-pentanediol: a diol, but it's a meso compound, which is achiral. So in normal-phase HPLC, it would also elute as a single peak.

So, in a normal-phase HPLC, the two compounds would give two peaks.

But wait, could there be any other factors? For example, the presence of multiple stereoisomers or constitutional isomers. But in this case, each product is a single compound, so each would be a single peak.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. This column has a chiral stationary phase, which can separate enantiomers or diastereomers.

The two compounds in the mixture are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: an enantiomer would be (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But in this case, Reaction I only produced the S enantiomer, so this would be a single enantiomer. On a chiral HPLC column, an enantiomer would elute as a single peak because it's a pure enantiomer.

2. Meso-2,4-pentanediol: it's an achiral compound. So on a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak because it doesn't have any enantiomers (since it's a meso compound). Wait, no, wait. Meso compounds are achiral, so they don't have enantiomers. So in a chiral column, it would still elute as a single peak because it's not chiral. Wait, but wait, the column is for separating chiral compounds. So if a compound is achiral, would it interact with the stationary phase differently?

Wait, no, the chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. But if a compound is achiral, it would not be separated by the chiral column. So in this case, the meso compound is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak, but the chiral column wouldn't separate it further.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. The chiral column would separate enantiomers, but not meso compounds. How about the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: it's a single enantiomer, so it would elute as a single peak. The meso compound would also elute as a single peak. So, in the chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single enantiomer, so on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. The meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. So the total peaks on the chiral column would be two.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the normal-phase HPLC has two peaks: one for each compound.

The chiral HPLC has two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but wait. The meso compound is a single compound, so in both HPLC methods, it would be a single peak. Similarly, the (S) compound is a single peak. So both would have two peaks in each column.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options don't have two peaks in both columns. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, none of the options match two peaks in both. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is more than one compound? Let me think again.

In Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Wait, wait, perhaps the product is a diol with four stereocenters? No, earlier analysis said two, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me clarify. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So when each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, in this structure, the two OH-bearing carbons are C2 and C4. Each is attached to two CH2 groups, but in reality, each is attached to:

C2: -CH2-OH-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me write the structure properly.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol: HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. No, wait, pentane is five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me count: 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH(OH)-

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the original compound is pentane-2,4-dione, which would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So after reduction, it would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's 2,4-pentanediol, but that would require six carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to move forward with the assumption that Reaction II gives a meso compound.

So, Reaction II gives one compound.

So, the combined products are two compounds: one from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product has more than one stereoisomer? Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So a single enantiomer. So in the product, only one compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. As discussed, the product is a meso compound, so a single compound.

So combined, they have two compounds.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction II isn't a meso compound. Let me think again.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. But considering the reduction, each ketone could lead to either R or S configuration. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two alcohols would be in a way that the product is a meso compound.

Wait, no, perhaps each reduction leads to a racemic mixture, but due to the symmetry, the product ends up as a single meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but for a symmetrical molecule, that would be equivalent to a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each ketone is reduced independently, leading to a mixture of diastereomers.

Wait, no, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer. Let me think: for 2,4-pentanediol, if each OH is on the same face, it's a meso compound. If they're on opposite faces, it's a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetrical starting material, the product would be a single diastereomer, the meso form, because the reaction doesn't favor either configuration.

So, Reaction II gives a single compound: the meso diol.

Therefore, the two reactions give two products.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction II is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers. Let me think again.

Wait, in a symmetrical diketone, when each ketone is reduced, the two OH groups can be on the same face (meso) or opposite faces (racemic mixture). But would NaBH4, which is a non-chiral reducing agent, produce a racemic mixture or a single meso compound?

Wait, perhaps it would produce a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face of each ketone, and since the molecule is symmetrical, the overall product would be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, which would then form a single meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, when each ketone is reduced, each can form either R or S configuration. But in the case of a symmetrical molecule, the configurations could lead to a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, for example, if both OHs are R, but in a symmetrical position, that would actually make the molecule meso because flipping it would result in the same structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers, each with two OH groups in a R,S configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it this way. In a symmetrical molecule, if each chiral center is R, and due to the symmetry, the overall molecule is R,R which is the same as S,S because of the mirror plane. So the molecule would be a meso compound.

Therefore, Reaction II produces a single compound, the meso diol.

So, in the combined mixture, we have two compounds: the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the (S) compound is a single enantiomer, so one peak. The meso compound is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak, but would the chiral column separate it?

Wait, no. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. If a compound is achiral, it won't have any enantiomers, and the column wouldn't separate it. So the meso compound would elute as a single peak on both columns.

Therefore, in both columns, two peaks.

But looking back at the options, none match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me re-examine the reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, which reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. If the product is a meso compound, then it's one product. So total products are two.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks in either case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another product. Let me think again.

Wait, when pentane-2,4-dione is treated with NaBH4, perhaps it's possible that the reduction doesn't go to completion, but the question says 100% completion.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction produces more than one product. Let me think, is there a possibility of more than one diol?

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. Let me think about that.

If the product is a pair of enantiomers, then in the mixture, they would each be present as a 50:50 mixture. But on a chiral column, they would elute as two peaks. On a normal-phase column, they would elute as a single peak because they're identical in terms of physical properties except chirality.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product was a meso compound, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, for pentane-2,4-dione, upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. The two OHs can be either on the same face (meso) or opposite faces (racemic mixture). So if the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, then in the mixture, they are present as two diastereomers? No, wait, no. Because in a racemic mixture, it's 50:50 of each enantiomer, which are mirror images. So in the normal-phase HPLC, they would co-elute as a single peak because they have the same physical properties except for chirality.

So, if Reaction II produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), then in the mixture, after combining with Reaction I's product, the total would be three peaks on the normal-phase HPLC: two from the diol (as a single peak) and one from the (S) compound. Wait, no, because the racemic diol would be a single peak in normal-phase but two in chiral.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If Reaction II produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (R,R and S,S), then:

On normal-phase HPLC, both enantiomers would have the same elution profile and appear as a single peak.

On chiral HPLC, they would be separated into two peaks.

So, in the combined mixture, Reaction I gives one compound (S-configured), and Reaction II gives a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

So, in normal-phase HPLC:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 peak.

- The racemic diol: 1 peak.

Total: 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 peak.

- The two enantiomers of the diol: 2 peaks.

Total: 3 peaks.

So, in the chiral HPLC, we have three peaks; in normal-phase, two peaks.

Looking at the options, option B is 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. So the answer would be B.

Wait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier in assuming Reaction II produced a meso compound. Maybe it actually produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

So, let's recap:

Reaction I: produces one enantiomer (S).

Reaction II: produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers).

Thus, when combined, the mixture has:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 compound.

- (R,R) and (S,S) pentane-2,4-diol: 2 enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the pentane-2,4-diol would have two stereocenters, so the possible stereoisomers are:

Option 1: both R â†’ enantiomer is both S.

So, when NaBH4 is used to reduce the symmetrical diketone, it produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.

So in the mixture, the diol is present as a racemic mixture (two enantiomers). So the total number of compounds is three:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

2. (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol.

3. (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, no, because (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, but how many compounds are present? If they're in a racemic mixture, it's just a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers. So the total number of compounds is two: the (S) compound from Reaction I and the diol (which is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers).

Wait, but the diol is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, which are present as two distinct compounds in the mixture.

So, in the mixture after combining, there are three compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol, and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, no. (R,R) and (S,S) would be two separate enantiomers, so three compounds in total.

So, when run on a normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, the diol would appear as a single peak, and the (S) compound as another. So total two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, the diol's two enantiomers would separate into two peaks, and the (S) compound as another. So three peaks.

So the answer would be option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using HPLC. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a single enantiomer because the reduction does not alter the configuration at the chiral center.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone).
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (a reducing agent).
- **Product**: 2,4-pentanediol. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the reduction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

### Combined Products:
- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 compound).
- From Reaction II: (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol (2 enantiomers).

Thus, the combined mixture contains **three compounds**:
1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
2. (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol.
3. (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on polarity.
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol will each elute as a single peak because enantiomers have identical polarity.
   - **Total peaks**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers.
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will elute as a single peak because it is a single enantiomer.
   - The racemic mixture of (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol will separate into two peaks.
   - **Total peaks**: 3.

### Conclusion:
- **Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 peaks.
- **Chiral HPLC**: 3 peaks.

This matches **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, and then asks about the chromatograms when the products are combined and run on different HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction step by step.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but since the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one. So, the structure is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Hmm, wait, noâ€” the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So position 3 is the ketone, and position 5 has a methoxy group.

So, the molecule is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group? Wait, no, the S designation is for the chiral center. So the molecule must have a chiral center at C5, which has a methoxy group, a hydrogen (since it's a hexan-3-one, so positions 1-6), so at C5, the groups would be: CH2CH2CH3 (from C6 maybe?), CH2CH2OCH3, and another group. Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: hexan-3-one would have the carbonyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, more accurately, it's CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe it's (CH2)2C=O-(CH2)3CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's:

Structure: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hexane is six carbons. So 3-ketone would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that can't be because that would be 3-pentanone, but wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? That would be 6 carbons. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Hexan-3-one:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3.

But wait, the molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So at position 5, which is the fifth carbon, there's a methoxy group attached. So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, because if it's 5-methoxy, then the substituent is on carbon 5. So, carbon 5 is CH2, but with a methoxy group attached? Wait, no, carbon 5 would be attached to the oxygen. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let's move forward.

Reaction I: treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone (position 3) becomes a secondary alcohol. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you get the corresponding secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, so yes, the product would be a secondary alcohol. Also, the configuration at the chiral center (carbon 5) is (S). So when we reduce the ketone, does the configuration at C5 change? No, because the reduction is at C3. So C5's configuration remains S.

So, after Reaction I, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. I think that's correct.

Then, after LAH treatment, there's an acidic workup. But I'm not sure if that affects anything. Maybe it protonates any remaining groups, but the main product is the secondary alcohol.

So Reaction I gives one compound: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH, I think. Wait, structure is CH2(COCH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)CH2COCH3? No, wait, pentane would have five carbons. Let me think: positions 2 and 4 have ketone groups.

So structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 2,4-pentanedione. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Yes, that's correct. So two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Now, when treated with NaBH4. Normally, NaBH4 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LAH, but it can reduce ketones. However, when a compound has two ketone groups, like 2,4-pentanedione, the situation is different.

Wait, NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides, but in this case, it's only ketones. So treating 2,4-pentanedione with NaBH4 would reduce each ketone to a secondary alcohol.

So, each C=O becomes a CH(OH). But wait, with excess NaBH4, both ketones would be reduced. So the product would be HOCH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-? No, the structure is more like CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So, when each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be CH3-C(OH)-CH2-C(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that would give us a diol, specifically 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups, so after reduction with excess NaBH4, both are reduced. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol: CH3CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3.

But wait, considering the stereochemistry. Each reduction can proceed with either the R or S configuration, but since the starting material is symmetrical, the product might form a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture.

Wait, wait, the starting material is 2,4-pentanedione, which is symmetrical. Because the two ketone groups are on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric due to the central CH2 group.

So when reducing each ketone, each would form an alcohol. Let's think about the reduction.

When NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it adds the hydride to the carbonyl carbon. In the case of a symmetrical ketone (like acetone), the reduction doesn't create any new chiral centers because the molecule is symmetric. But in pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is on a different carbon. Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric, so each ketone is in a mirror-image position. So when each ketone is reduced, the resulting OH groups could end up in the same or opposite configurations.

Wait, but wait, if the two ketones are symmetrical, then the product would have two chiral centers, but they would be either both R, both S, or one R and one S. But wait, in this case, because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would either be on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, but the starting material is a symmetrical diketone. So when NaBH4 is used, will the reduction of each ketone lead to a specific configuration? Or will it lead to a racemic mixture?

Wait, NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, NaBH4 is a chiral source? No, wait, no, NaBH4 is achiral, so when it reduces a prochiral ketone, it may form a racemic mixture. But in a symmetrical ketone, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

In the case of a single ketone, like acetone (prochiral), NaBH4 reduces it to a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) secondary alcohols. But if the ketone is part of a symmetrical molecule, like pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetrical around the central carbon, then when each ketone is reduced, the resulting diol may have internal planes of symmetry.

Wait, so when the first ketone is reduced, say on C2, the hydride adds to C2, giving a single configuration (R or S). Then the same happens on C4. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be in a specific configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the product is meso.

Wait, perhaps I need to draw the structure. So pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, correction: the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no, that's 2,4-pentanedione. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So each ketone is on a CH2 group. Hmm, wait, no. Let me correct: the structure is (CH3)COCH2COCH3? No, that can't be, because that would be four carbons. Wait, no.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione: the parent chain is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketones. So the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CH2)COCH3. No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C(=O)

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C(=O)

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain. So the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, no, that would be four carbons because:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3 has five carbons: positions 1 (O=C-), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (C(=O)), 5 (CH3). So, it's pentane-2,4-dione.

So when both ketones are reduced with NaBH4, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, because the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So after reduction, each O=C becomes O-H. So the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, more accurately, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. So it's 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry. Each CH2 group with OH was originally a ketone, so each was a CH2 in the diketone. When reduced, each becomes CH(OH)CH2. Wait, does each reduction create a new chiral center?

Wait, in the diketone, each ketone is on a CH2 group. So each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two identical groups. Wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Each ketone is on a CH2 group. So when each CH2-C(=O) is reduced, the resulting CH2-CH(OH) groups. Wait, but wait, no: the structure is:

Original ketone group: (CH2)2-C(=O)-. No, wait, perhaps each ketone is on a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each ketone is on a central CH2 group. Let me think of the molecule as:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So each ketone is on a CH2 group, but the central CH2 is between the two ketones. So when each ketone is reduced, the CH2 becomes CH(OH), but in which configuration?

Wait, since the two ketones are symmetrical, perhaps each reduction leads to the same configuration, leading to either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, in the product, 2,4-pentanediol, the molecule would have two chiral centers at C2 and C4.

If both OH groups are on the same side, the molecule may be a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, if both OHs are on the same side, the molecule would be achiral (meso).

Alternatively, if the OHs are on opposite sides, the molecule would have two chiral centers leading to a pair of enantiomers. But wait, with excess NaBH4, which is a strong enough reducing agent but not necessarily stereoselective beyond providing both possible configurations.

Wait, but NaBH4 is not a chiral reagent, so when it reduces each ketone, it could produce both R and S configurations. However, in the case of a symmetrical diketone, the product may be a racemic mixture, but perhaps in this case, due to the symmetry, it ends up as a single meso compound.

Wait, no, because when each ketone is reduced, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to R or S configuration. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two OHs could end up in a way that the molecule is meso, meaning the overall compound is achiral.

Wait, let me think of a simpler example. Take 2,3-dihydroxybutane (erythrose and threose), but in this case, it's 2,4-pentanediol. Wait, but pentane-2,4-diol would have the structure HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product of pentane-2,4-dione reduction would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Each OH is on a CH2 group, but wait, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 2,4-pentanediol. Now, each of the two CH2 groups with OH is a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because each CH2-OH is connected to two CH2 groups and an OH and the rest.

Wait, actually, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, the carbons with OH are C2 and C4. So, C2: attached to CH3 (C1), CH2OH (C3?), and two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it again.

Wait, the molecule would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's 2,4-pentanediol. So each of the second and fourth carbons have OH groups attached. Wait, no, because the positions are 2 and 4 in the pentane chain.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

No, that's six carbons. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, meaning it has two chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. So, the product would have two OH groups, but arranged symmetrically. Therefore, the product would be a single compound, a meso form, which is achiral.

But wait, when NaBH4 is used to reduce a symmetrical diketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, the product is a single meso diol. Because the reduction of each ketone leads to the same configuration on each side, due to the symmetry. So, the molecule would be meso, meaning it's superimposable on its mirror image, thus having no net chirality.

So, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, it's a single compound with two stereocenters but achiral.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the reduction. Each ketone is on a CH2 group, so when NaBH4 reduces each, each CH2 becomes CH(OH). Now, the configuration of each OH would depend on the approach of the hydride. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would end up either both on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps when each ketone is reduced, the OHs are added on the same face, leading to a meso compound. Because the molecule is symmetrical, any such configuration would result in the same overall structure.

So, Reaction II gives a single product: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, and if it's a meso compound, then it's a single compound, so in the reaction, only one product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 50:50 mixture of R,R and S,S, which would be a racemic mixture. But wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical, so the R,R and S,S would be identical in that case, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, no, because if the molecule is symmetrical, R,R would be the same as S,S, or no, wait, no. Let me think about it.

In meso compounds, the molecule has multiple stereocenters but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. For 2,4-pentanediol, if the two OHs are on the same side, the molecule would be a meso form. Because if you mirror the molecule along the central plane, it would look the same.

So, for pentane-2,4-diol, if the OHs are on the same side, the molecule is meso, which is a single compound. But if they're on opposite sides, it would be a pair of enantiomers (R,R and S,S), which would be two enantiomeric pairs, but in reality, they'd form two distinct compounds. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in a symmetrical molecule, if each stereocenter is R, and due to the symmetry, the other would also be R, but that would create a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me take a simpler example. Take tartaric acid: the meso form has two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, so the molecule is achiral. So in our case, if the two OHs are on the same face, the molecule would be a meso form, and thus a single compound.

So, in this case, the product of Reaction II is a single meso compound, so only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps each ketone is reduced independently, and the two OHs could be in either configuration, but due to the symmetry, they end up being a single compound.

So now, putting it all together.

After Reaction I and II, the products are:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (a single compound).

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (a single compound).

So, when these two products are combined, the mixture has two compounds.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Reaction I produces one compound, and Reaction II produces another compound. So when combined, the mixture has two distinct compounds.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "the products from both reactions are combined." So each reaction produces a single compound. So the combined mixture has two compounds.

Now, when running these on an HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase and a normal-phase column, how many peaks would they show.

First, for the normal-phase HPLC: it's based on the polarity of the compounds. The stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. Compounds with higher polarity will elute later (retained longer) because they interact more with the stationary phase.

The two compounds are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group. It's a single enantiomer, so in normal-phase HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

2. Meso-2,4-pentanediol: a diol, but it's a meso compound, which is achiral. So in normal-phase HPLC, it would also elute as a single peak.

So, in a normal-phase HPLC, the two compounds would give two peaks.

But wait, could there be any other factors? For example, the presence of multiple stereoisomers or constitutional isomers. But in this case, each product is a single compound, so each would be a single peak.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. This column has a chiral stationary phase, which can separate enantiomers or diastereomers.

The two compounds in the mixture are:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: an enantiomer would be (R)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But in this case, Reaction I only produced the S enantiomer, so this would be a single enantiomer. On a chiral HPLC column, an enantiomer would elute as a single peak because it's a pure enantiomer.

2. Meso-2,4-pentanediol: it's an achiral compound. So on a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak because it doesn't have any enantiomers (since it's a meso compound). Wait, no, wait. Meso compounds are achiral, so they don't have enantiomers. So in a chiral column, it would still elute as a single peak because it's not chiral. Wait, but wait, the column is for separating chiral compounds. So if a compound is achiral, would it interact with the stationary phase differently?

Wait, no, the chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. But if a compound is achiral, it would not be separated by the chiral column. So in this case, the meso compound is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak, but the chiral column wouldn't separate it further.

Wait, but wait. Let's think. The chiral column would separate enantiomers, but not meso compounds. How about the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: it's a single enantiomer, so it would elute as a single peak. The meso compound would also elute as a single peak. So, in the chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but no. Let me think again. The (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single enantiomer, so on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak. The meso-2,4-pentanediol is achiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. So the total peaks on the chiral column would be two.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the normal-phase HPLC has two peaks: one for each compound.

The chiral HPLC has two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but wait. The meso compound is a single compound, so in both HPLC methods, it would be a single peak. Similarly, the (S) compound is a single peak. So both would have two peaks in each column.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options don't have two peaks in both columns. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, none of the options match two peaks in both. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction II, the product is more than one compound? Let me think again.

In Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

Wait, wait, perhaps the product is a diol with four stereocenters? No, earlier analysis said two, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me clarify. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So when each ketone is reduced, each becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, in this structure, the two OH-bearing carbons are C2 and C4. Each is attached to two CH2 groups, but in reality, each is attached to:

C2: -CH2-OH-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me write the structure properly.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol: HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. No, wait, pentane is five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me count: 2 and 4 positions on a five-carbon chain.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: CH(OH)-

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the original compound is pentane-2,4-dione, which would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So after reduction, it would be HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's 2,4-pentanediol, but that would require six carbons, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to move forward with the assumption that Reaction II gives a meso compound.

So, Reaction II gives one compound.

So, the combined products are two compounds: one from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product has more than one stereoisomer? Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So a single enantiomer. So in the product, only one compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. As discussed, the product is a meso compound, so a single compound.

So combined, they have two compounds.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction II isn't a meso compound. Let me think again.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. But considering the reduction, each ketone could lead to either R or S configuration. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the two alcohols would be in a way that the product is a meso compound.

Wait, no, perhaps each reduction leads to a racemic mixture, but due to the symmetry, the product ends up as a single meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but for a symmetrical molecule, that would be equivalent to a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps each ketone is reduced independently, leading to a mixture of diastereomers.

Wait, no, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer. Let me think: for 2,4-pentanediol, if each OH is on the same face, it's a meso compound. If they're on opposite faces, it's a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetrical starting material, the product would be a single diastereomer, the meso form, because the reaction doesn't favor either configuration.

So, Reaction II gives a single compound: the meso diol.

Therefore, the two reactions give two products.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product of Reaction II is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers. Let me think again.

Wait, in a symmetrical diketone, when each ketone is reduced, the two OH groups can be on the same face (meso) or opposite faces (racemic mixture). But would NaBH4, which is a non-chiral reducing agent, produce a racemic mixture or a single meso compound?

Wait, perhaps it would produce a racemic mixture because the hydride can attack from either face of each ketone, and since the molecule is symmetrical, the overall product would be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, which would then form a single meso compound.

Wait, no. Wait, when each ketone is reduced, each can form either R or S configuration. But in the case of a symmetrical molecule, the configurations could lead to a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, for example, if both OHs are R, but in a symmetrical position, that would actually make the molecule meso because flipping it would result in the same structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't produce a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers, each with two OH groups in a R,S configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of it this way. In a symmetrical molecule, if each chiral center is R, and due to the symmetry, the overall molecule is R,R which is the same as S,S because of the mirror plane. So the molecule would be a meso compound.

Therefore, Reaction II produces a single compound, the meso diol.

So, in the combined mixture, we have two compounds: the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the (S) compound is a single enantiomer, so one peak. The meso compound is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak, but would the chiral column separate it?

Wait, no. Chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. If a compound is achiral, it won't have any enantiomers, and the column wouldn't separate it. So the meso compound would elute as a single peak on both columns.

Therefore, in both columns, two peaks.

But looking back at the options, none match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me re-examine the reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, which reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. If the product is a meso compound, then it's one product. So total products are two.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks in either case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing another product. Let me think again.

Wait, when pentane-2,4-dione is treated with NaBH4, perhaps it's possible that the reduction doesn't go to completion, but the question says 100% completion.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction produces more than one product. Let me think, is there a possibility of more than one diol?

Alternatively, perhaps the product of Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. Let me think about that.

If the product is a pair of enantiomers, then in the mixture, they would each be present as a 50:50 mixture. But on a chiral column, they would elute as two peaks. On a normal-phase column, they would elute as a single peak because they're identical in terms of physical properties except chirality.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product was a meso compound, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, for pentane-2,4-dione, upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. The two OHs can be either on the same face (meso) or opposite faces (racemic mixture). So if the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, then in the mixture, they are present as two diastereomers? No, wait, no. Because in a racemic mixture, it's 50:50 of each enantiomer, which are mirror images. So in the normal-phase HPLC, they would co-elute as a single peak because they have the same physical properties except for chirality.

So, if Reaction II produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers), then in the mixture, after combining with Reaction I's product, the total would be three peaks on the normal-phase HPLC: two from the diol (as a single peak) and one from the (S) compound. Wait, no, because the racemic diol would be a single peak in normal-phase but two in chiral.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If Reaction II produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (R,R and S,S), then:

On normal-phase HPLC, both enantiomers would have the same elution profile and appear as a single peak.

On chiral HPLC, they would be separated into two peaks.

So, in the combined mixture, Reaction I gives one compound (S-configured), and Reaction II gives a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

So, in normal-phase HPLC:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 peak.

- The racemic diol: 1 peak.

Total: 2 peaks.

On chiral HPLC:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 peak.

- The two enantiomers of the diol: 2 peaks.

Total: 3 peaks.

So, in the chiral HPLC, we have three peaks; in normal-phase, two peaks.

Looking at the options, option B is 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. So the answer would be B.

Wait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier in assuming Reaction II produced a meso compound. Maybe it actually produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

So, let's recap:

Reaction I: produces one enantiomer (S).

Reaction II: produces a racemic mixture (two enantiomers).

Thus, when combined, the mixture has:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: 1 compound.

- (R,R) and (S,S) pentane-2,4-diol: 2 enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the pentane-2,4-diol would have two stereocenters, so the possible stereoisomers are:

Option 1: both R â†’ enantiomer is both S.

So, when NaBH4 is used to reduce the symmetrical diketone, it produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.

So in the mixture, the diol is present as a racemic mixture (two enantiomers). So the total number of compounds is three:

1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

2. (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol.

3. (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, no, because (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, but how many compounds are present? If they're in a racemic mixture, it's just a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers. So the total number of compounds is two: the (S) compound from Reaction I and the diol (which is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers).

Wait, but the diol is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, which are present as two distinct compounds in the mixture.

So, in the mixture after combining, there are three compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol, and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, no. (R,R) and (S,S) would be two separate enantiomers, so three compounds in total.

So, when run on a normal-phase HPLC, which doesn't separate enantiomers, the diol would appear as a single peak, and the (S) compound as another. So total two peaks.

On a chiral HPLC, the diol's two enantiomers would separate into two peaks, and the (S) compound as another. So three peaks.

So the answer would be option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using HPLC. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a single enantiomer because the reduction does not alter the configuration at the chiral center.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting material**: Pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone).
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (a reducing agent).
- **Product**: 2,4-pentanediol. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the reduction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

### Combined Products:
- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 compound).
- From Reaction II: (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol (2 enantiomers).

Thus, the combined mixture contains **three compounds**:
1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
2. (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol.
3. (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on polarity.
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol will each elute as a single peak because enantiomers have identical polarity.
   - **Total peaks**: 2.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers.
   - (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will elute as a single peak because it is a single enantiomer.
   - The racemic mixture of (R,R)-2,4-pentanediol and (S,S)-2,4-pentanediol will separate into two peaks.
   - **Total peaks**: 3.

### Conclusion:
- **Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 peaks.
- **Chiral HPLC**: 3 peaks.

This matches **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

ANSWER: B
