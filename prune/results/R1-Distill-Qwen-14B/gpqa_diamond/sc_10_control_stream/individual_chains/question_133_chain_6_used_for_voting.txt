Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I think it involves buffer solutions and the dissociation of phosphoric acid. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, which probably means we can use standard constants.

I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the relevant dissociation steps are:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2-. Or maybe I got that mixed up. Let me make sure. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait no, that's the acid. Then the dihydrogen phosphate is H2PO4^-, and hydrogen phosphate is HPO4^2-. So orthophosphate might refer to HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down their formulas. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, so yeah, HPO4^2-). 

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but wait, those are adjacent in the dissociation steps. So I think this forms a buffer solution between the second and third dissociations. Or actually, between the first and second? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton (from H3PO4) or accept one (from HPO4^2-). 

Wait, no. Let's think about their positions. H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, H2PO4^- is after losing one H+ (so that's the first dissociation step), HPO4^2- is after losing a second H+ (second dissociation), and PO4^3- is after the third.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-—so that's the system between the first and second dissociation steps. Wait no, because H2PO4^- is from H3PO4 losing one H+ (Ka1), and HPO4^2- is from H2PO4^- losing another H+ (Ka2). So the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer between the second and third steps? Or wait, no, no. Wait, the buffer is between the two species that can donate or accept a proton. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they're adjacent in the dissociation series. 

Wait, no, in a buffer solution, you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So if you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which one is the acid and which is the base? H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so it's the acid), and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^- (so it's the conjugate base). So together, they form a buffer around the pH corresponding to Ka2.

So the question is, what's the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution? Or wait, wait. The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the acid. Alternatively, sometimes people refer to the HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The options are all in the 1e-7 M range, which suggests that the concentration is low, but perhaps the solution is a buffer, so the HPO4^2- concentration is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each component. Then, since the solution volume is given, we can find their concentrations.

So let's compute moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So each mole of the compound gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait. Are there any reactions between these two ions in solution? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So the presence of both will establish an equilibrium. But because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are both present, the buffer equation applies here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, for the second dissociation, which is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

So the pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So in this buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

But wait, the problem is not asking about pH. It's asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

But wait, in a buffer solution, the concentrations of the acid and base are determined by the amount of each substance. But the actual concentration might be adjusted based on the pH. Hmm, but wait, in a buffer, the pH is determined by the ratio. So the concentrations are in equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is, what is the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-) in the solution. But I'm not sure if it's as simple as taking the moles divided by volume because the solution is a buffer and the actual concentrations are determined by the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe in this case, since both are present in the solution, their concentrations are as calculated from the initial moles, but I'm not considering any reactions because the solution is buffered and the concentrations don't change much. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but when you have a buffer solution, the concentrations are as you initially have them because the buffer resists changes. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is just 0.02805 M. But wait, that's about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, which is much larger than the options given (which are all ~1e-7 M). So that can't be right. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate? Oh wait, no, PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form. Orthophosphate is often considered as HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps the solution is that the concentrations are not directly additive because of the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe the solution is to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then use that pH to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide pH. Alternatively, perhaps the [HPO4^2-] can be found by considering the buffer equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the solubility of phosphoric acid species. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is more about the speciation of phosphate in solution.

Let me consider that in solution, H3PO4 is in equilibrium with H2PO4^-, which is in equilibrium with HPO4^2-, and so on. But in this solution, we have added both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they will form a buffer solution. So the pH can be found using the Henderson equation, but the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if the solution is buffered, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio determined by the pH and the pKa. But in this case, the initial concentrations are 0.03675 M H2PO4^- and 0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I think that in the solution, the actual concentrations are determined by the solution's pH, which is determined by the buffer. So perhaps the concentrations are as calculated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is in the solution as given, but that doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the solution isn't just a simple buffer. Maybe the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- leads to some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is actually the HPO4^2- form, and we need to find its concentration considering the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the pH would be pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But the problem is that we don't know the pH. Hmm, perhaps I can find the pH from the given concentrations.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, I can't directly find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe the solution is that the concentrations are in a certain ratio, and the given moles are the actual concentrations. But that would mean that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that's not possible.

Wait, I'm really confused now. Let me think again. Perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, the solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol. So concentration is 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. So concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763.

Taking the log of 0.763 is about -0.116.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.116) = 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.094.

Hmm, but how does this help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration in the buffer, but about the concentration that comes from the dissociation of H3PO4. But that doesn't make sense because we're adding the ions directly.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the actual concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation steps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is what it is, but the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm missing something about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, they form a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson equation. But I'm not sure how that leads to such a low concentration.

Wait, wait a second. I think I must have made a mistake in considering the problem. Let's think about this differently. Maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the fully deprotonated form. Because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12. But that's a very small Ka, so PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

But the problem states that it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is usually understood as HPO4^2-, but sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So maybe the question is about PO4^3-.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration would be very low. Let me calculate that.

In a solution where [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, and the pH is about 7.094, can I find [PO4^3-]?

Because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We need [H+]. Since pH is about 7.094, [H+] is 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.3e-8.

Let me compute that.

Multiply numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Divide by 8.3e-8: 5.05e-14 / 8.3e-8 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but the options are around 1e-7 M. Hmm, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait: did I make a mistake in the pH calculation?

Earlier, I found the pH ≈7.094, which gives [H+] ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Then, pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

[base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763.

Log(0.763) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Thus, [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.16e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.16e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.16e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.16e-8 = approx 6.19e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait—another thing to consider: when you have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- might not be just the initial value because some of it might dissociate further into PO4^3-.

But the initial assumption is that the solution is primarily composed of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and any dissociation beyond that is minimal because Ka3 is very small. So the initial moles contribute to the buffer, and any PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

So perhaps the question is asking for [PO4^3-], which is the orthophosphate in the fully deprotonated form. And the concentration is around 6.2e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches this.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation steps are:

1. **H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)  
2. **H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻** (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)  
3. **HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻** (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)  

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol). The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).  

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant pKa is pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.03675}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.16 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻} \quad (K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12})
\]  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.19 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) is approximately \(6.19 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches the closest option.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I think it involves buffer solutions and the dissociation of phosphoric acid. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, which probably means we can use standard constants.

I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the relevant dissociation steps are:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But wait, the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2-. Or maybe I got that mixed up. Let me make sure. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait no, that's the acid. Then the dihydrogen phosphate is H2PO4^-, and hydrogen phosphate is HPO4^2-. So orthophosphate might refer to HPO4^2-.

So the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down their formulas. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, so yeah, HPO4^2-). 

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but wait, those are adjacent in the dissociation steps. So I think this forms a buffer solution between the second and third dissociations. Or actually, between the first and second? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton (from H3PO4) or accept one (from HPO4^2-). 

Wait, no. Let's think about their positions. H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, H2PO4^- is after losing one H+ (so that's the first dissociation step), HPO4^2- is after losing a second H+ (second dissociation), and PO4^3- is after the third.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-—so that's the system between the first and second dissociation steps. Wait no, because H2PO4^- is from H3PO4 losing one H+ (Ka1), and HPO4^2- is from H2PO4^- losing another H+ (Ka2). So the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer between the second and third steps? Or wait, no, no. Wait, the buffer is between the two species that can donate or accept a proton. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because they're adjacent in the dissociation series. 

Wait, no, in a buffer solution, you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So if you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which one is the acid and which is the base? H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so it's the acid), and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^- (so it's the conjugate base). So together, they form a buffer around the pH corresponding to Ka2.

So the question is, what's the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution? Or wait, wait. The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the acid. Alternatively, sometimes people refer to the HPO4^2- as orthophosphate. Alternatively, maybe orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The options are all in the 1e-7 M range, which suggests that the concentration is low, but perhaps the solution is a buffer, so the HPO4^2- concentration is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So the first step is to calculate the moles of each component. Then, since the solution volume is given, we can find their concentrations.

So let's compute moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molar mass 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, molar mass 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So each mole of the compound gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.00561 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but wait. Are there any reactions between these two ions in solution? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So the presence of both will establish an equilibrium. But because H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are both present, the buffer equation applies here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, for the second dissociation, which is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

So the pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So in this buffer solution, the pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

But wait, the problem is not asking about pH. It's asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

But wait, in a buffer solution, the concentrations of the acid and base are determined by the amount of each substance. But the actual concentration might be adjusted based on the pH. Hmm, but wait, in a buffer, the pH is determined by the ratio. So the concentrations are in equilibrium.

Wait, but the question is, what is the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-) in the solution. But I'm not sure if it's as simple as taking the moles divided by volume because the solution is a buffer and the actual concentrations are determined by the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe in this case, since both are present in the solution, their concentrations are as calculated from the initial moles, but I'm not considering any reactions because the solution is buffered and the concentrations don't change much. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but when you have a buffer solution, the concentrations are as you initially have them because the buffer resists changes. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is just 0.02805 M. But wait, that's about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, which is much larger than the options given (which are all ~1e-7 M). So that can't be right. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the orthophosphate? Oh wait, no, PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form. Orthophosphate is often considered as HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps the solution is that the concentrations are not directly additive because of the reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe the solution is to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then use that pH to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide pH. Alternatively, perhaps the [HPO4^2-] can be found by considering the buffer equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the solubility of phosphoric acid species. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is more about the speciation of phosphate in solution.

Let me consider that in solution, H3PO4 is in equilibrium with H2PO4^-, which is in equilibrium with HPO4^2-, and so on. But in this solution, we have added both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they will form a buffer solution. So the pH can be found using the Henderson equation, but the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if the solution is buffered, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a ratio determined by the pH and the pKa. But in this case, the initial concentrations are 0.03675 M H2PO4^- and 0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I think that in the solution, the actual concentrations are determined by the solution's pH, which is determined by the buffer. So perhaps the concentrations are as calculated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is in the solution as given, but that doesn't match the options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the solution isn't just a simple buffer. Maybe the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- leads to some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is actually the HPO4^2- form, and we need to find its concentration considering the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:

pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the pH would be pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But the problem is that we don't know the pH. Hmm, perhaps I can find the pH from the given concentrations.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, I can't directly find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe the solution is that the concentrations are in a certain ratio, and the given moles are the actual concentrations. But that would mean that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02805 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that's not possible.

Wait, I'm really confused now. Let me think again. Perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, the solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol. So concentration is 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol. So concentration is 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M HPO4^2-.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02805 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763.

Taking the log of 0.763 is about -0.116.

So pH = pKa2 + (-0.116) = 7.21 - 0.116 ≈ 7.094.

Hmm, but how does this help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration in the buffer, but about the concentration that comes from the dissociation of H3PO4. But that doesn't make sense because we're adding the ions directly.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the actual concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation steps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is what it is, but the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm missing something about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, they form a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson equation. But I'm not sure how that leads to such a low concentration.

Wait, wait a second. I think I must have made a mistake in considering the problem. Let's think about this differently. Maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the fully deprotonated form. Because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12. But that's a very small Ka, so PO4^3- concentration would be very low.

But the problem states that it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is usually understood as HPO4^2-, but sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So maybe the question is about PO4^3-.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration would be very low. Let me calculate that.

In a solution where [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M, and the pH is about 7.094, can I find [PO4^3-]?

Because the third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We need [H+]. Since pH is about 7.094, [H+] is 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.3e-8.

Let me compute that.

Multiply numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Divide by 8.3e-8: 5.05e-14 / 8.3e-8 ≈ 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but the options are around 1e-7 M. Hmm, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to this value.

Wait, but wait: did I make a mistake in the pH calculation?

Earlier, I found the pH ≈7.094, which gives [H+] ≈ 8.3e-8 M.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Then, pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

[base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

[acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.03675 M.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763.

Log(0.763) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Thus, [H+] = 10^(-7.092) ≈ 8.16e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / 8.16e-8.

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 ≈ 5.05e-14.

Denominator: 8.16e-8.

So 5.05e-14 /8.16e-8 = approx 6.19e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait—another thing to consider: when you have a solution with both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- might not be just the initial value because some of it might dissociate further into PO4^3-.

But the initial assumption is that the solution is primarily composed of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and any dissociation beyond that is minimal because Ka3 is very small. So the initial moles contribute to the buffer, and any PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation.

So perhaps the question is asking for [PO4^3-], which is the orthophosphate in the fully deprotonated form. And the concentration is around 6.2e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches this.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) and the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The dissociation steps are:

1. **H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻** (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)  
2. **H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻** (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)  
3. **HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻** (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)  

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol). The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).  

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{0.00735 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03675 \, \text{M}
  \]

- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]  
  \[
  \text{Concentration of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02805 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant pKa is pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\).  

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.03675}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
\]

The hydrogen ion concentration is:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.16 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻} \quad (K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-12})
\]  
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] \approx \frac{5.05 \times 10^{-14}}{8.16 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.19 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) is approximately \(6.19 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches the closest option.
