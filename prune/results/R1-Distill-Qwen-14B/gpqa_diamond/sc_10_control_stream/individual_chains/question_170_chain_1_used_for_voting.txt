Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. 

Let me break down what I know. The state is given as (3i, 4). I'm assuming this is a two-component spinor since electrons have spin-1/2, which can be represented as a two-element vector in a complex Hilbert space. 

The spin operator S_y for the y-direction is given in the problem. It's represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, right, because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y provided is:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the matrix for S_y would be (ħ/2) times that, which gives:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector again. So in formula terms, <S_y> = ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, ψ here is the given state. I need to represent it as a column vector. The state is (3i,4), so as a column vector, it would be:

ψ = [3i; 4]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually column vectors, and the conjugate transpose is used. So the conjugate transpose ψ† would be the row vector [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i), 4 ].

But wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the state is written as a column vector, ψ = [a; b], then ψ† is [a*, b*], which is a row vector. So in this case, ψ = [3i; 4], so ψ† is [-3, 4], because (3i)* is -3i, and 4 is real so its conjugate is itself.

So the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's compute S_y * ψ. Then multiply by ψ†.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, actually, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me write that out. So:

ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Multiplying S_y by ψ:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] * [3i; 4]

Let me compute each component.

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, the first component when you multiply the matrix with the vector is (row 1 of matrix) · (column vector).

So first row of S_y is [0, -i].

So 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second row is [i, 0].

So (i)*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So yes, S_y ψ is (ħ/2)* [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So ψ† S_y ψ is [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So let's compute this scalar product:

( -3 )*( -4i ) + 4*( -3 )

= 12i + (-12)

= (12i -12)

But wait, wait. Wait, no: let me calculate each term:

First term: -3 multiplied by (ħ/2)*(-4i) ?

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The entire S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by the vector [ -4i; -3 ].

So ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3, 4 ] * [ (ħ/2)(-4i), (ħ/2)(-3) ]^T ?

Wait, no. Wait, S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ], so when we multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) with S_y ψ (which is (ħ/2) times this vector), we get the sum of products.

So ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3, 4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So it's (ħ/2) * [ (-3)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]

Compute each term:

(-3)*(-4i) = 12i

4*(-3) = -12

So total is 12i -12.

So the sum is 12i -12. Multiply by (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) * (12i -12) = (ħ/2) * [12(i -1)] = 6ħ (i -1) 

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have complex numbers. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication. Because ψ† is a row vector, and S_y ψ is a column vector. So the product should be a scalar, the sum of the products of the elements. Let me go through it again.

Wait, let me represent S_y ψ as (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ]

So the product is: (-3)(-4i) * (ħ/2) + (4)(-3) * (ħ/2)

Wait, why? Because when you multiply a row vector [a, b] with a column vector [c; d], you get a*c + b*d.

Ah, but in this case, S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ]

So the product is [ -3,4 ] * [ (ħ/2)(-4i), (ħ/2)(-3) ]^T ?

Wait no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

Let me denote S_y ψ as a column vector:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

So when you take ψ† multiplied by S_y ψ, it's [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So each component is:

-3 * (-4i) * (ħ/2) + 4 * (-3) * (ħ/2)

Which simplifies to:

(12i) * (ħ/2) + (-12) * (ħ/2 )

= (12i - 12) * (ħ/2 )

Factor out 12: 12 (i -1) * (ħ/2 )

Which is 6 ħ (i -1 )

Wait, but this gives a complex number, but the expectation value for spin should be a real number because spin is an observable. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when I applied the Pauli matrix.

Wait, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So sigma_y is the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

So when I compute sigma_y multiplied by the state vector [3i;4], I get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So that part is correct. So S_y ψ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, but when I compute ψ† multiplied by S_y ψ, the product must be real. So I must have a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, right? So yes, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait wait, wait. Because ψ is a column vector. So the first component is 3i, its conjugate is -3i, and the second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no! Wait, no, wait. The state is given as (3i, 4), so as a column vector, it's [3i;4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ (3i)*, (4)* ] → [ -3i,4 ].

Ah, so I had it correct earlier. So ψ† is [ -3i,4 ]

So when I multiply [ -3i,4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The product is [ -3i,4 ] multiplied by the column vector [ -4i; -3 ] multiplied by (ħ/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12 (-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So the total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): ( ħ/2 ) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the expectation value is -12 ħ / 25? Wait, no, wait, why did I think that?

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, no, the calculation I just did gives -24 * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

So my calculation just now gives -12 ħ, which isn't one of the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to normalize the state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized to 1. But the given state is (3i,4), so let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9)(1) + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state would be (3i/5, 4/5). But wait, the question didn't state that the vector is normalized. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and we need to consider that in the calculation.

Ah, that's the mistake! I didn't normalize the state vector. So the state is not normalized, and thus the expectation value calculation would be different.

So the state vector is ψ = [3i; 4]. Its norm is sqrt( (3)^2 + (4)^2 ) = 5. So the normalized vector is (1/5) [3i;4]. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = (3^2)(i^0) + 4^2 = 9 +16=25. So yes, the norm is 5. So to normalize, we divide by 5.

So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

But the question says the electron is in the state (3i,4), so perhaps I should proceed with the given state, but then the expectation value would be calculated with that state, but if the state is not normalized, the expectation value is not the same as if it were normalized.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The expectation value formula is <S_y> = (ψ†) S_y ψ / (ψ† ψ ), because if the state is not normalized, the expectation value is scaled by the norm.

But wait, no: the expectation value is calculated as (ψ† S_y ψ ) divided by (ψ† ψ ) only if you're using the unnormalized state. Because if the state is not normalized, you have to normalize it first. So the correct approach is to normalize the state.

So perhaps I should first normalize the state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value without worrying about normalization because the expectation value is given by ψ† S_y ψ, regardless of normalization, but in that case, the result would be scaled by the norm squared.

But I think the correct approach is to normalize the state first. So let me proceed.

So the normalized state is ψ_norm = (1/5) [3i;4]

Then ψ_norm† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3/5, 4/5 ]

Now, compute S_y ψ_norm.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]

So S_y ψ_norm = (ħ/2) * [[0*(-3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) ], [i*(3i/5) + 0* (4/5) ] ]

Wait, let me compute each component.

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

Multiply each by (ħ/2):

So S_y ψ_norm is (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]

Now, ψ_norm† is [ -3/5, 4/5 ]

So ψ_norm† multiplied by S_y ψ_norm is:

( -3/5 ) * ( (-4i/5) ) * (ħ/2) + (4/5) * ( (-3/5) ) * (ħ/2 )

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

The product is:

[ -3/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5); (-3/5) ]

Which is:

( -3/5 * (-4i/5) ) * (ħ/2) + (4/5 * (-3/5) ) * (ħ/2 )

Compute each term:

First term: (12i)/25 * (ħ/2) = (12i ħ) / 50.

Second term: ( -12/25 ) * (ħ/2 ) = (-12 ħ ) /50.

Add them together:

(12i ħ -12 ħ ) / 50.

Factor out 12 ħ:

12 ħ (i -1 ) /50 = (6 ħ (i -1 )) /25.

Wait, that's still complex, which can't be right. So I must have made another mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication. Let's compute each term again.

First term: (-3/5) * (-4i/5) = (12i)/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Each multiplied by (ħ/2):

So first term: (12i/25) * (ħ/2) = 6i ħ /25.

Second term: (-12/25) * (ħ/2 )= -6 ħ /25.

So total sum: (6i ħ -6 ħ ) /25.

Factor out 6 ħ: 6 ħ (i -1 ) /25.

But this is still a complex number. Which can't be right because expectation values of observables must be real.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the multiplication when I applied sigma_y.

Wait, let's recompute S_y ψ_norm.

S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

sigma_y times ψ_norm is:

sigma_y * [3i/5; 4/5 ]

= [ (0*(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) ), (i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ) ]

= [ (-4i/5 ), (3i^2/5 ) ]

i^2 is -1, so 3i^2/5 = -3/5.

So S_y ψ_norm = (ħ/2) * [ (-4i/5 ), (-3/5) ]

So when I compute ψ_norm† * S_y ψ_norm:

ψ_norm† is [ (-3/5)*, (4/5)* ] = [ (-3/5)* is (3i/5) ??? Wait, wait, no. Wait, ψ_norm is (3i/5, 4/5 ), so ψ_norm† is [ (3i/5)*, (4/5)* ].

(3i/5)* is (-3i)/5. (4/5)* is 4/5.

So ψ_norm† is [ (-3i/5), 4/5 ].

Now, ψ_norm† multiplied by S_y ψ_norm is:

[ (-3i/5) , 4/5 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5 ), (-3/5) ]

Which is:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) * (ħ/2) + (4/5) * (-3/5) * (ħ/2 )

Compute each term:

First term:

(-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12 (-1) = -12.

So ( -3i/5 ) * (-4i/5 ) = (12 i²)/(25) )= -12/25.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (-12/25) * (ħ/2 ) = (-6 ħ )/25.

Second term:

(4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25.

Multiply by (ħ/2 ): (-12/25) * (ħ/2 )= (-6 ħ )/25.

So the sum is (-6 ħ/25) + (-6 ħ/25 ) = (-12 ħ )/25.

Ah, that's a real number, which makes sense.

So the expectation value <S_y> is (-12 ħ )/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

So the correct answer is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given state is \( \psi = (3i, 4) \). To compute the expectation value, the state must be normalized. The norm of \( \psi \) is:
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Conjugate Transpose**: The conjugate transpose of \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Action of \( S_y \)**: The action of \( S_y \) on \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) is:
   \[
   S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Computing each component:
   - First component:
     \[
     0 \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + (-i) \cdot \frac{4}{5} = -\frac{4i}{5}.
     \]
   - Second component:
     \[
     i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + 0 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{3i^2}{5} = -\frac{3}{5}.
     \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value**: The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{norm}}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - First term:
     \[
     \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   - Second term:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. 

Let me break down what I know. The state is given as (3i, 4). I'm assuming this is a two-component spinor since electrons have spin-1/2, which can be represented as a two-element vector in a complex Hilbert space. 

The spin operator S_y for the y-direction is given in the problem. It's represented by the Pauli matrix sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, right, because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y provided is:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the matrix for S_y would be (ħ/2) times that, which gives:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector again. So in formula terms, <S_y> = ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, ψ here is the given state. I need to represent it as a column vector. The state is (3i,4), so as a column vector, it would be:

ψ = [3i; 4]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually column vectors, and the conjugate transpose is used. So the conjugate transpose ψ† would be the row vector [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i), 4 ].

But wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the state is written as a column vector, ψ = [a; b], then ψ† is [a*, b*], which is a row vector. So in this case, ψ = [3i; 4], so ψ† is [-3, 4], because (3i)* is -3i, and 4 is real so its conjugate is itself.

So the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's compute S_y * ψ. Then multiply by ψ†.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it as ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, actually, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me write that out. So:

ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Multiplying S_y by ψ:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]] * [3i; 4]

Let me compute each component.

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, the first component when you multiply the matrix with the vector is (row 1 of matrix) · (column vector).

So first row of S_y is [0, -i].

So 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second row is [i, 0].

So (i)*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So yes, S_y ψ is (ħ/2)* [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So ψ† S_y ψ is [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So let's compute this scalar product:

( -3 )*( -4i ) + 4*( -3 )

= 12i + (-12)

= (12i -12)

But wait, wait. Wait, no: let me calculate each term:

First term: -3 multiplied by (ħ/2)*(-4i) ?

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The entire S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by the vector [ -4i; -3 ].

So ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3, 4 ] * [ (ħ/2)(-4i), (ħ/2)(-3) ]^T ?

Wait, no. Wait, S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ], so when we multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) with S_y ψ (which is (ħ/2) times this vector), we get the sum of products.

So ψ† S_y ψ = [ -3, 4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So it's (ħ/2) * [ (-3)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]

Compute each term:

(-3)*(-4i) = 12i

4*(-3) = -12

So total is 12i -12.

So the sum is 12i -12. Multiply by (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) * (12i -12) = (ħ/2) * [12(i -1)] = 6ħ (i -1) 

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have complex numbers. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the order of multiplication. Because ψ† is a row vector, and S_y ψ is a column vector. So the product should be a scalar, the sum of the products of the elements. Let me go through it again.

Wait, let me represent S_y ψ as (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

So ψ† is [ -3, 4 ]

So the product is: (-3)(-4i) * (ħ/2) + (4)(-3) * (ħ/2)

Wait, why? Because when you multiply a row vector [a, b] with a column vector [c; d], you get a*c + b*d.

Ah, but in this case, S_y ψ is (ħ/2) multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ]

So the product is [ -3,4 ] * [ (ħ/2)(-4i), (ħ/2)(-3) ]^T ?

Wait no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.

Let me denote S_y ψ as a column vector:

S_y ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ]

So when you take ψ† multiplied by S_y ψ, it's [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ]

So each component is:

-3 * (-4i) * (ħ/2) + 4 * (-3) * (ħ/2)

Which simplifies to:

(12i) * (ħ/2) + (-12) * (ħ/2 )

= (12i - 12) * (ħ/2 )

Factor out 12: 12 (i -1) * (ħ/2 )

Which is 6 ħ (i -1 )

Wait, but this gives a complex number, but the expectation value for spin should be a real number because spin is an observable. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when I applied the Pauli matrix.

Wait, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So sigma_y is the matrix [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

So when I compute sigma_y multiplied by the state vector [3i;4], I get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So that part is correct. So S_y ψ is (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, but when I compute ψ† multiplied by S_y ψ, the product must be real. So I must have a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, right? So yes, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait wait, wait. Because ψ is a column vector. So the first component is 3i, its conjugate is -3i, and the second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no! Wait, no, wait. The state is given as (3i, 4), so as a column vector, it's [3i;4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ (3i)*, (4)* ] → [ -3i,4 ].

Ah, so I had it correct earlier. So ψ† is [ -3i,4 ]

So when I multiply [ -3i,4 ] * (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The product is [ -3i,4 ] multiplied by the column vector [ -4i; -3 ] multiplied by (ħ/2).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12 (-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So the total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Multiply by (ħ/2): ( ħ/2 ) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the expectation value is -12 ħ / 25? Wait, no, wait, why did I think that?

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, no, the calculation I just did gives -24 * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

So my calculation just now gives -12 ħ, which isn't one of the options. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to normalize the state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized to 1. But the given state is (3i,4), so let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9)(1) + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state would be (3i/5, 4/5). But wait, the question didn't state that the vector is normalized. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and we need to consider that in the calculation.

Ah, that's the mistake! I didn't normalize the state vector. So the state is not normalized, and thus the expectation value calculation would be different.

So the state vector is ψ = [3i; 4]. Its norm is sqrt( (3)^2 + (4)^2 ) = 5. So the normalized vector is (1/5) [3i;4]. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = (3^2)(i^0) + 4^2 = 9 +16=25. So yes, the norm is 5. So to normalize, we divide by 5.

So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/5) [3i;4].

But the question says the electron is in the state (3i,4), so perhaps I should proceed with the given state, but then the expectation value would be calculated with that state, but if the state is not normalized, the expectation value is not the same as if it were normalized.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The expectation value formula is <S_y> = (ψ†) S_y ψ / (ψ† ψ ), because if the state is not normalized, the expectation value is scaled by the norm.

But wait, no: the expectation value is calculated as (ψ† S_y ψ ) divided by (ψ† ψ ) only if you're using the unnormalized state. Because if the state is not normalized, you have to normalize it first. So the correct approach is to normalize the state.

So perhaps I should first normalize the state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value without worrying about normalization because the expectation value is given by ψ† S_y ψ, regardless of normalization, but in that case, the result would be scaled by the norm squared.

But I think the correct approach is to normalize the state first. So let me proceed.

So the normalized state is ψ_norm = (1/5) [3i;4]

Then ψ_norm† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3/5, 4/5 ]

Now, compute S_y ψ_norm.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]

So S_y ψ_norm = (ħ/2) * [[0*(-3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) ], [i*(3i/5) + 0* (4/5) ] ]

Wait, let me compute each component.

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) = (-4i)/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

Multiply each by (ħ/2):

So S_y ψ_norm is (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5), (-3/5) ]

Now, ψ_norm† is [ -3/5, 4/5 ]

So ψ_norm† multiplied by S_y ψ_norm is:

( -3/5 ) * ( (-4i/5) ) * (ħ/2) + (4/5) * ( (-3/5) ) * (ħ/2 )

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly.

The product is:

[ -3/5, 4/5 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5); (-3/5) ]

Which is:

( -3/5 * (-4i/5) ) * (ħ/2) + (4/5 * (-3/5) ) * (ħ/2 )

Compute each term:

First term: (12i)/25 * (ħ/2) = (12i ħ) / 50.

Second term: ( -12/25 ) * (ħ/2 ) = (-12 ħ ) /50.

Add them together:

(12i ħ -12 ħ ) / 50.

Factor out 12 ħ:

12 ħ (i -1 ) /50 = (6 ħ (i -1 )) /25.

Wait, that's still complex, which can't be right. So I must have made another mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the multiplication. Let's compute each term again.

First term: (-3/5) * (-4i/5) = (12i)/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Each multiplied by (ħ/2):

So first term: (12i/25) * (ħ/2) = 6i ħ /25.

Second term: (-12/25) * (ħ/2 )= -6 ħ /25.

So total sum: (6i ħ -6 ħ ) /25.

Factor out 6 ħ: 6 ħ (i -1 ) /25.

But this is still a complex number. Which can't be right because expectation values of observables must be real.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the multiplication when I applied sigma_y.

Wait, let's recompute S_y ψ_norm.

S_y is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

sigma_y times ψ_norm is:

sigma_y * [3i/5; 4/5 ]

= [ (0*(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) ), (i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ) ]

= [ (-4i/5 ), (3i^2/5 ) ]

i^2 is -1, so 3i^2/5 = -3/5.

So S_y ψ_norm = (ħ/2) * [ (-4i/5 ), (-3/5) ]

So when I compute ψ_norm† * S_y ψ_norm:

ψ_norm† is [ (-3/5)*, (4/5)* ] = [ (-3/5)* is (3i/5) ??? Wait, wait, no. Wait, ψ_norm is (3i/5, 4/5 ), so ψ_norm† is [ (3i/5)*, (4/5)* ].

(3i/5)* is (-3i)/5. (4/5)* is 4/5.

So ψ_norm† is [ (-3i/5), 4/5 ].

Now, ψ_norm† multiplied by S_y ψ_norm is:

[ (-3i/5) , 4/5 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) [ (-4i/5 ), (-3/5) ]

Which is:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) * (ħ/2) + (4/5) * (-3/5) * (ħ/2 )

Compute each term:

First term:

(-3i)(-4i) = 12 i² = 12 (-1) = -12.

So ( -3i/5 ) * (-4i/5 ) = (12 i²)/(25) )= -12/25.

Multiply by (ħ/2): (-12/25) * (ħ/2 ) = (-6 ħ )/25.

Second term:

(4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25.

Multiply by (ħ/2 ): (-12/25) * (ħ/2 )= (-6 ħ )/25.

So the sum is (-6 ħ/25) + (-6 ħ/25 ) = (-12 ħ )/25.

Ah, that's a real number, which makes sense.

So the expectation value <S_y> is (-12 ħ )/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25.

So the correct answer is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]
   where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **State Vector**: The given state is \( \psi = (3i, 4) \). To compute the expectation value, the state must be normalized. The norm of \( \psi \) is:
   \[
   \|\psi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Conjugate Transpose**: The conjugate transpose of \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Action of \( S_y \)**: The action of \( S_y \) on \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \) is:
   \[
   S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Computing each component:
   - First component:
     \[
     0 \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + (-i) \cdot \frac{4}{5} = -\frac{4i}{5}.
     \]
   - Second component:
     \[
     i \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + 0 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{3i^2}{5} = -\frac{3}{5}.
     \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value**: The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger S_y \psi_{\text{norm}}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - First term:
     \[
     \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   - Second term:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \cdot \left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = -\frac{12}{25}.
     \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
