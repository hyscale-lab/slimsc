Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far-field diffraction pattern. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh wait, N is infinitely large, so the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. If all the apothems are the same length 'a', for a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Or is it the radius or the apothem that's 'a'? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

In a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N), because the apothem is the adjacent side in a right triangle where the opposite side is (s/2) and the angle is π/N, where s is the side length. But when N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So for a polygon with a very large N, the apothem 'a' is approximately equal to the radius R. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. Wait, because when the aperture becomes a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at a radius where J1(k a) = 0. The zeros of J1 occur at specific points; the first zero is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, for the circular aperture, the minima are found when the argument of the Bessel function equals the first zero. The general formula is that the minima occur at θ where a sinθ = p * λ / (2π), where p is the order of the zero. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard formula.

The angular position of the m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by θ_m = (λ/(π a)) * x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for the dark rings in the diffraction pattern is that the phase difference between the light arriving from different parts of the aperture causes destructive interference. For a circular aperture, the far-field intensity minima occur where the Bessel function J1 reaches its zeros. The first minimum occurs at the first zero of J1, which is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the angle θ is given by a sinθ = λ (x)/(2π). Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

The formula for the angular position of the m-th minimum is θ_m = (λ/(π a)) * x_m, where x_m is the m-th root of J1. The first minimum is when x_1 is approximately 3.8317, but wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I might be confusing the zeros of J1 and J1’ (the derivative). Let me recheck.

Wait, the minima of the diffraction pattern (the dark rings) occur where J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. So the condition is J1( (2π a / λ) sinθ ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at positions x where J1(x) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second at approximately 7.0156, and so on.

But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum is the first ring outside the central spot, which corresponds to m=1. So for the first minimum, x=3.8317.

But in the problem, we are being asked about the first two minima. Hmm, wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because the central maximum is the brightest spot, and the first minimum is the first ring that's darker. Wait, but if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the minima are at θ where (a sinθ) = (m λ)/(π), for m=1,2,3,... Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the first minimum is at θ1 and the second at θ2, and find the angular distance between them.

Wait, no. Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern has a series of concentric dark rings. The first dark ring is the first minimum, the next is the second minimum, etc. So the angular positions for the m-th minimum are given by θ_m = (m λ)/(π a), where m is 1,2,3,...? Or is it a different formula?

Wait, I think I should recall the correct condition. The angular position θ for a minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:

θ_m = λ/(π a) * x_m,

where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for the first minimum, x_1=3.8317, and for the second, x_2=7.0156.

Wait, no, actually, J1 has zeros at 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So for the first minimum, m=1, x=3.8317. So θ1 = (3.8317 * λ)/(π a). Similarly, θ2 is (7.0156 * λ)/(π a). Then the angular distance between the first and second minima is θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to assume that the angles are small, so that tanθ ≈ θ. So maybe we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ in radians.

But wait, in the Fraunhofer diffraction, the condition for a minimum is when (a sinθ) = (x_m * λ)/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. Or wait, perhaps it's (a sinθ) = (x_m λ)/(2π), but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the condition for the m-th minimum is a sinθ = (x_m * λ)/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the angle θ is given by sinθ ≈ θ ≈ (x_m λ)/(2π a). So the first minimum is at m=1, x_1=3.8317, θ1≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), and the second at m=2, x_2=7.0156, θ2≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). The angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = [ (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ ]/(2π a) = (3.1839 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ approximately 0.506 (λ/a).

Wait, let me compute that: 3.1839 divided by 6.2832. Hmm, 6.2832 is approximately 2π. 3.1839 is about half of that, so 3.1839/6.2832 is roughly 0.506.

So the angular separation would be about 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So that's the answer. But wait, why is that the case? Because when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the first two minima in the diffraction pattern are at theta positions determined by the zeros of J1.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 * lambda/(a). Wait, wait—no, that's the formula for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a single slit. Oh wait, right! For a single slit of width 'a', the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,3,... So the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a) multiplied by (π/2), wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, for a single slit, the condition is a sinθ = m λ, so θ = (m λ)/a. But wait, single slit diffraction minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, so the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a). But that can't be right because the first minimum for a single slit is at θ= (lambda)/(a) * 1, but sometimes it's expressed as (lambda/(a)) * (pi) or something else. Wait, no, wait, no, the formula is a sinθ = m λ. So m=1 gives θ=arcsin(λ/a). But wait, in the far field (Fraunhofer), for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/(a). But that's for the single-slit case. But for a circular aperture, it's different because the diffraction pattern is determined by Bessel functions, not just sine functions.

Wait, but in the problem, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. The first minimum occurs at theta where a sin theta = (lambda x)/2pi, with x=3.8317. So sin theta ≈ theta ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(2pi a). So theta1 ≈ (3.8317/(2pi)) * (lambda/a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) lambda/a ≈ 0.610 lambda/a. Then the first minimum is at 0.610 lambda/a. The second minimum is at theta2 = (7.0156 lambda)/(2pi a) ≈ (7.0156/6.2832) * (lambda/a) ≈ 1.116 lambda/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is theta2 - theta1 = (1.116 - 0.610) * (lambda/a) ≈ 0.506 lambda/a. So that's option D.

Wait, but wait—this is the case when N is approaching infinity. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circle, and the first two minima are at 0.610 and 1.116, leading to a separation of 0.506. So the answer should be option D.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the first minimum. Because for the circular aperture, the central maximum is followed by the first dark ring, which is the first minimum. So yes, the first minimum is at x=3.8317, which is about 0.610 lambda/a, and the next minimum is at 7.0156, which is about 1.116 lambda/a, so the separation is 0.506 lambda/a.

So the correct answer is D.

When the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\), and \(N\) approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circle with radius \(a\). The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The angular positions of the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern are given by:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} x_m,
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). The first zero of \(J_1\) is at \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero is at \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Substituting these values:

\[
\theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 3.8317, \quad \theta_2 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 7.0156.
\]

The angular separation between the first and second minima is:

\[
\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} (x_2 - x_1).
\]

Substituting \(x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839\):

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 3.1839.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):

\[
\Delta \theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{3.1416} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \cdot \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a second. If all the apothems are the same length 'a', for a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Or is it the radius or the apothem that's 'a'? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

In a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N), because the apothem is the adjacent side in a right triangle where the opposite side is (s/2) and the angle is π/N, where s is the side length. But when N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So for a polygon with a very large N, the apothem 'a' is approximately equal to the radius R. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. Wait, because when the aperture becomes a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at a radius where J1(k a) = 0. The zeros of J1 occur at specific points; the first zero is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, for the circular aperture, the minima are found when the argument of the Bessel function equals the first zero.

The angular position of the m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by θ_m = (λ/(π a)) * x_m, where x_m is the m-th zero of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the condition for the dark rings in the diffraction pattern is that the phase difference between the light arriving from different parts of the aperture causes destructive interference. For a circular aperture, the far-field intensity minima occur where the Bessel function J1 reaches its zeros. The first minimum occurs at the first zero of J1, which is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the angle θ is given by a sinθ = λ (x)/(2π). Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula.

The formula for the angular position of the m-th minimum is θ_m = (λ/(π a)) * x_m, where x_m is the m-th root of J1. The first minimum is when x_1 is approximately 3.8317, but wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I might be confusing the zeros of J1 and J1’ (the derivative). Let me recheck.

Wait, the minima of the diffraction pattern (the dark rings) occur where J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. So the condition is J1( (2π a / λ) sinθ ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at positions x where J1(x) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second at approximately 7.0156, and so on.

But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum is the first ring outside the central spot, which corresponds to m=1. So for the first minimum, x=3.8317.

But in the problem, we are being asked about the first two minima. Hmm, wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Because the central maximum is the brightest spot, and the first minimum is the first ring that's darker. Wait, but if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the minima are at θ where (a sinθ) = (m λ)/(π), for m=1,2,3,... Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the first minimum is at θ1 and the second at θ2, and find the angular distance between them.

Wait, no. Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the diffraction pattern has a series of concentric dark rings. The first dark ring is the first minimum, the next is the second minimum, etc. So the angular positions for the m-th minimum are given by θ_m = (m λ)/(π a), where m is 1,2,3,...? Or is it a different formula?

Wait, I think I should recall the correct condition. The angular position θ for a minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:

θ_m = λ/(π a) * x_m,

where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for the first minimum, x_1=3.8317, and for the second, x_2=7.0156.

Wait, no, actually, J1 has zeros at 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So for the first minimum, m=1, x=3.8317. So θ1 = (3.8317 * λ)/(π a). Similarly, θ2 is (7.0156 * λ)/(π a). Then the angular distance between the first and second minima is θ2 - θ1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to assume that the angles are small, so that tanθ ≈ θ. So maybe we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ in radians.

But wait, in the Fraunhofer diffraction, the condition for a minimum is when (a sinθ) = (x_m * λ)/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. Or wait, perhaps it's (a sinθ) = (x_m λ)/(2π), but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the condition for the m-th minimum is a sinθ = (x_m * λ)/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the angle θ is given by sinθ ≈ θ ≈ (x_m λ)/(2π a). So the first minimum is at m=1, x_1=3.8317, θ1≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), and the second at m=2, x_2=7.0156, θ2≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). The angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = [ (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ ]/(2π a) = (3.1839 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ/a) ≈ approximately 0.506 (λ/a).

Wait, let me compute that: 3.1839 divided by 6.2832. Hmm, 6.2832 is approximately 2π. 3.1839 is about half of that, so 3.1839/6.2832 is roughly 0.506.

So the angular separation would be about 0.506 λ/a. Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a. So that's the answer. But wait, why is that the case? Because when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the first two minima in the diffraction pattern are at theta positions determined by the zeros of J1.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 * lambda/(a). Wait, wait—no, that's the formula for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a single slit. Oh wait, right! For a single slit of width 'a', the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, m=1,2,3,... So the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a) multiplied by (π/2), wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, for a single slit, the condition is a sinθ = m λ, so θ = (m λ)/a. But wait, single slit diffraction minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, so the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a). But that can't be right because the first minimum for a single slit is at θ= (lambda)/(a) * 1, but sometimes it's expressed as (lambda/(a)) * (pi) or something else. Wait, no, wait, no, the formula is a sinθ = m λ. So m=1 gives θ=arcsin(λ/a). But wait, in the far field (Fraunhofer), for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/(a). But that's for the single-slit case. But for a circular aperture, it's different because the diffraction pattern is determined by Bessel functions, not just sine functions.

Wait, but in the problem, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. The first minimum occurs at theta where a sin theta = (lambda x)/2pi, with x=3.8317. So sin theta ≈ theta ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(2pi a). So theta1 ≈ (3.8317/(2pi)) * (lambda/a) ≈ (3.8317)/(6.2832) lambda/a ≈ 0.610 lambda/a. Then the first minimum is at 0.610 lambda/a. The second minimum is at theta2 = (7.0156 lambda)/(2pi a) ≈ (7.0156/6.2832) * (lambda/a) ≈ 1.116 lambda/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is theta2 - theta1 = (1.116 - 0.610) * (lambda/a) ≈ 0.506 lambda/a. So that's option D.

Wait, but wait—this is the case when N is approaching infinity. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circle, and the first two minima are at 0.610 and 1.116, leading to a separation of 0.506. So the answer should be option D.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing the first minimum. Because for the circular aperture, the central maximum is followed by the first dark ring, which is the first minimum. So yes, the first minimum is at x=3.8317, which is about 0.610 lambda/a, and the next minimum is at 7.0156, which is about 1.116 lambda/a, so the separation is 0.506 lambda/a.

So the correct answer is D.


When the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length \(a\), and \(N\) approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circle with radius \(a\). The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The angular positions of the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern are given by:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} x_m,
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). The first zero of \(J_1\) is at \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero is at \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Substituting these values:

\[
\theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 3.8317, \quad \theta_2 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 7.0156.
\]

The angular separation between the first and second minima is:

\[
\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} (x_2 - x_1).
\]

Substituting \(x_2 - x_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839\):

\[
\Delta \theta = \frac{\lambda}{\pi a} \cdot 3.1839.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):

\[
\Delta \theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{3.1416} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \cdot \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
