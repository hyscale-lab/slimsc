Okay, so I've got this physics problem about annihilation, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two particles each, A⁺ and A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I think that means its velocity is much less than the speed of light, maybe non-relativistic? Or perhaps the kinetic energy is low compared to their rest mass energy. Hmm.

The given mass-energy of A is mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so I need to calculate beta (v/c) for A.

Wait, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Since the antiproton is slow, maybe the initial momentum isn't too high, but I'm not sure. Let me think about what's conserved in this process.

In annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, I need to consider their rest masses and any kinetic energy. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So if the antiproton is moving slowly, but its rest mass is still 938 MeV. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe we can assume that the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy. Or perhaps we can model this as a center-of-momentum frame thing. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, so 938 MeV each. But if they are moving towards each other, right? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some low speed. Or perhaps both are moving with some velocities. Hmm. I'm not sure about the setup there.

Wait, the problem says 'the antiproton is slowly moving' — so maybe the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, and the proton is at rest. Or perhaps both are moving towards each other, but since the antiproton is slow, their combined momentum is manageable.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we're in a frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton has low velocity. So the initial momentum would just be the momentum of the antiproton.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the initial conditions. Let me try to write down the knowns and unknowns.

Knowns:
- The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.
- mA c² = 300 MeV.
- The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe v_antip ≈ 0, or its velocity is much less than c. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is small, so its total energy is close to its rest energy.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial system (proton + antiproton) has a certain energy and momentum, and the products (the two A particles) must conserve that.

Wait, but the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ — so four particles in total. Hmm, but maybe they are emitted symmetrically. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in some symmetric way, maybe in opposite directions.

Wait, but maybe assuming that all four A particles move in the same direction? No, that seems unlikely. More probably, they move in pairs or symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are produced symmetrically, so their momenta balance in a certain way.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial proton and antiproton. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity v. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe v is much less than c, so its gamma is approximately 1. So the total energy of the system would be the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton.

Wait, but the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c². But since it's moving slowly, gamma is ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but if v is small, then gamma is approximately 1, so the energy is approximately m_p c².

Wait, but that would make the total initial energy approximately 2 m_p c². But the rest mass of the products is 2*(m_A c²) *2? Wait, no, because there are 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻, so four particles, each with mass 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But the initial energy is 2 * m_p c², which is about 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. So the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products. So there's kinetic energy available, which goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should model this using the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial proton as being at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is gamma m_p v (since momentum p = gamma m v). The initial total energy is m_p c² + gamma m_p c². Wait, but since the antiproton is moving at velocity v, which is much less than c, gamma is approximately 1.

Wait, but I think it's better to proceed without assuming v is non-relativistic. Maybe I can't ignore relativistic effects because the products might be moving at relativistic speeds.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to consider that the initial system consists of a proton at rest and an antiproton moving with some velocity, so the total momentum is that of the antiproton. After the annihilation, the four A particles must have total momentum equal to that initial momentum.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps its energy is just m_p c², and the proton is at rest, so initial energy is about 2 m_p c². But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial system is in the center-of-momentum frame. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the reaction in the center-of-mass (COM) frame, where the total momentum is zero. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the COM frame is not the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the total momentum is small, so in the lab frame (proton at rest), the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. So in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial system's total energy is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. Wait, but that's not correct because there's kinetic energy involved.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The initial rest mass of the proton and antiproton is 2 * m_p c², but their kinetic energy adds to that.

Wait, but the initial state is a proton at rest and an antiproton moving with velocity v. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c². The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the annihilation, the four A particles must have energy E_A each, and momentum p_A each. But because the products are moving in some direction, their total momentum must equal the initial momentum.

But since there are four particles, perhaps they are moving in pairs, like two in one direction and two in the opposite. So maybe their momenta cancel out in pairs, except for their direction.

Wait, but that's not possible unless their momenta are arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, maybe all four are moving in the same direction, but that would make the total momentum large, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the case where all four A particles move in the same direction, each with momentum p. Then the total momentum after the reaction would be 4p. But that would have to equal the initial momentum, which is gamma m_p v.

But then their energies would each be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c² ?

Wait, perhaps that's a way to model it.

So, let's denote the initial momentum as P_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the reaction, the total momentum is 4 p_A, where p_A is the momentum of each A particle. So:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v → p_A = (gamma m_p v) /4.

Each A particle's energy is E_A = sqrt( (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c².

Wait, no, the energy E of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) / c².

No, wait, units are getting a bit messy. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, so E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So, E_A = sqrt( p_A² + m_A² ), where m_A is in units of energy (since c=1).

The total energy after the reaction is 4 E_A.

The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p + gamma m_p.

So, applying conservation of energy:

4 E_A = m_p (1 + gamma)

And conservation of momentum:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v → p_A = (gamma m_p v) /4.

But since E_A = sqrt( p_A² + m_A² ), substituting p_A:

E_A = sqrt( ( (gamma m_p v)/(4) )^2 + m_A^2 )

So, 4 E_A = m_p (1 + gamma )

Substituting E_A:

4 * sqrt( (gamma² m_p² v²)/(16) + m_A^2 ) = m_p (1 + gamma )

Wait, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So:

16 * [ (gamma^2 m_p² v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ] = m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2

Simplify the left side:

( gamma^2 m_p² v^2 ) + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

Hmm, let's expand that:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

I can subtract gamma^2 m_p^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma )

Wait, maybe it's better to rearrange terms. Let's bring all terms to one side:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 + 16 m_A^2 - m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma ) = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor gamma^2 m_p^2:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 - 1) + 16 m_A^2 - m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma ) = 0

But this seems complicated. Maybe I need to make some approximations. The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is much less than c. So maybe gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c^2), but since v is small, perhaps gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2). Hmm, but in terms of units where c=1, yes.

Wait, but in terms of units where c=1, v is a dimensionless fraction (like 0.1c would be 0.1). So, if v is small, then gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/2.

Wait, but maybe even that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the antiproton's velocity is such that its gamma is roughly 1, so we can approximate gamma as 1.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v is much less than c, so gamma is approximately 1. So, let's make that approximation. So gamma ≈ 1.

So, substituting gamma ≈ 1 into the equation.

Then, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 → m_p^2 v^2 (since gamma≈1)

And the right side becomes m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) ≈ m_p^2 (1 + 2*1 + 1) = m_p^2 *4.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me plug gamma=1 into the equation:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 +16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

=> m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 + 1) = 4 m_p^2.

Rearranged:

m_p² v^2 = 4 m_p^2 - 16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by m_p²:

v^2 = 4 - (16 m_A^2)/(m_p^2 )

But let's plug in the numbers.

m_A c² = 300 MeV → m_A = 300 MeV/c².

m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV → m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So, m_A / m_p = 300/938 ≈ 0.3195.

So, (m_A/m_p)^2 ≈ 0.3195^2 ≈ 0.102.

So, 16 (m_A/m_p)^2 ≈ 16 * 0.102 ≈ 1.632.

So, v² = 4 - 1.632 = 2.368.

But v² can't be more than 1 (since v is in units of c), so that's a problem. That implies v² is 2.368, which is greater than 1, which would mean v > c, which is impossible.

Hmm, so that suggests our assumption that gamma =1 is invalid. Because the result is impossible. So maybe the approximation that gamma ≈1 is not good enough.

So, perhaps gamma can't be approximated as 1. Therefore, we need to find a way to solve this without making that approximation. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial system is a proton and an antiproton moving towards each other with velocities v and -v, so that their momenta are equal and opposite. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Alternatively, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity v.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the initial system: a proton at rest (so momentum zero) and an antiproton moving with velocity v. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

After the annihilation, the four A particles are produced. Let's assume that each A has the same energy and momentum, but I'm not sure about their directions. To simplify, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the antiproton. But that might not be the case, but let's try.

So, each A has momentum p and energy E. So, total momentum after is 4p, which must equal p_initial = γ m_p v.

So, 4p = γ m_p v → p = γ m_p v /4.

The energy of each A is E = γ_A m_A c², where γ_A is the Lorentz factor for particle A. Alternatively, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c².

Wait, perhaps I should write E in terms of p.

So, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c² → no, wait, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c² )^2 ) / c²? No, wait, no, units-wise, when using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), then E is in energy units. So, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the units right. Momentum p is in kg m/s. Multiply by c (m/s) → (kg m²/s²) which is energy in joules. So, (p c) is energy. Similarly, m c² is energy. So sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) is sqrt of (energy)^2 + (energy)^2 → which is energy. So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, each A has energy E = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

So, the total energy after is 4 E = 4 * sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

But p is given by 4p = gamma m_p v → p = (gamma m_p v )/(4)

Wait, but we can write:

E = sqrt( ( (gamma m_p v c )/(4) )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

So, total energy after reaction is 4 E = 4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 c^4 )

And the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

So, setting 4 E = E_initial → 4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 )/(16) + (m_A c^2 )^2 ) = (1 + gamma) m_p c^2.

Divide both sides by c^2:

4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ) = (1 + gamma) m_p.

Square both sides:

16 [ (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ] = (1 + gamma)^2 m_p^2.

Simplify the left side:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 /16 *16 ? Wait, no, 16 multiplied by each term inside the sqrt.

Wait, no, when you square 4 * sqrt(...), you get 16 * (...).

So:

16 [ (gamma² m_p² v² )/(16) + m_A² ] = (1 + gamma )^2 m_p^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma )^2 m_p^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

So, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Subtract gamma^2 m_p^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 = (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2.

Factor left side:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 -1) +16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 - 1) +16 m_A^2 - (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can divide through by m_p^2 to make the equation dimensionless.

Let me define some variables to simplify:

Let x = v^2 → since v is in units of c.

Let β = v/c → x = β^2.

Let gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Let me express everything in terms of beta and gamma.

So, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 (beta^2) m_p^2 + 16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Wait, perhaps substituting m_A = 300 MeV/c² and m_p = 938 MeV/c².

Let me compute the ratio (m_A/m_p)²: (300/938)^2 ≈ (0.3195)^2 ≈ 0.102.

So, 16 m_A^2 = 16 * 0.102 m_p^2 ≈ 1.632 m_p^2.

So, the equation is:

gamma^2 beta^2 m_p^2 +1.632 m_p^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

gamma^2 beta^2 + 1.632 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 beta^2 +1.632 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

gamma^2 beta^2 + 0.632 = 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract gamma^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 beta^2 +0.632 - gamma^2 = 2 gamma.

Factor gamma^2:

gamma^2 (beta^2 -1 ) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

But beta^2 = v^2/c^2 → beta^2 = v^2 → but since v is the velocity of the antiproton, which is moving at speed v, beta is v/c. So, beta^2 = (v^2)/(c^2) = beta^2, so in terms of units, beta is v/c.

Wait, perhaps there's another substitution. Remember that gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, substituting this into the equation:

[1/(1 - beta^2)] (beta^2 -1 ) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

Wait, but (beta^2 -1 ) = -(1 - beta^2 ), so:

[1/(1-beta^2)] * (- (1 - beta^2 )) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

Which simplifies to:

-1 +0.632 = 2 gamma → -0.368 = 2 gamma.

But gamma is always positive, so this can't be correct. So, there must be a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Maybe the A particles are moving in a way that their momenta cancel each other out except for the initial momentum. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving symmetrically, so their total momentum is zero, except for some residual.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in pairs, such that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the A particles are moving with velocity much less than c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the kinetic energy of the initial antiproton is negligible, so we can treat the system as being in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the velocity of the products using the invariant quantities.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

In the initial state, sum E is m_p c² + gamma m_p c² and sum p is gamma m_p v.

So, the invariant mass squared is (E_total c)^2 - (p_total c^2 )^2.

Wait, but let me compute that.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So, invariant mass squared s = (E_initial c )^2 - (p_initial c^2 )^2.

Wait, no, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

Because energy is E, and momentum is p, so (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

So, s = [ (1+gamma) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

This should be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products.

Wait, the products are four A particles, each with rest mass m_A. So, the rest mass energy is 4 m_A c².

Wait, no, because each A has rest mass m_A, so four of them have rest mass energy 4 m_A c².

But wait, the invariant mass squared for the products would be (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

But in their rest frame, sum E = 4 m_A c² and sum p =0. So, the invariant mass squared is (4 m_A c² )^2.

So, setting the initial s equal to the final s:

[ (1+gamma) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

[ (1+gamma )^2 m_p^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 ] = 16 m_A^2.

Factor m_p^2:

m_p^2 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] = 16 m_A^2.

Expand (1+gamma )^2 → 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

So,

m_p^2 [1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me plug in the values in terms of ratios.

Given m_A c² =300 MeV and m_p c²=938 MeV.

So, m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p =938 MeV/c².

So, m_A/m_p = 300/938 ≈0.3195.

So, the equation becomes:

(938)^2 [ ... ] = 16 (300)^2.

But perhaps it's better to compute the ratio (m_A/m_p ) = 300/938 ≈0.3195.

So, 16 (m_A/m_p )^2 =16 (0.3195)^2 ≈16 * 0.102 ≈1.632.

So, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 -v^2 ) ] = 1.632 m_p^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 -v^2 ) =1.632.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I can express (1 -v^2 ) in terms of gamma.

Since gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), where beta = v/c, so beta^2 = v^2/c^2 → v^2 = beta^2 c².

So, 1 - v^2 =1 - beta^2 c² → but since v is in terms of c, beta^2 is v^2/c^2 → 1 -v^2 = 1 - (beta^2 c^2 ) → Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of beta = v/c.

So, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So, 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2.

So, (1 -v^2 ) =1 - beta^2 c^2 → but wait, v^2 =beta^2 c^2 → 1 -v^2/c^2 = 1 -beta^2 → which is 1/gamma^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, in terms of beta = v/c, gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So, 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2.

So, substituting into the equation:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) = 1.632.

Which becomes:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2*(1/gamma^2 ) = 1.632.

Because 1 - beta^2 =1/gamma^2.

So,

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2*(1/gamma^2 ) =1 +2 gamma +1 =2 + 2 gamma.

So,

2 + 2 gamma =1.632 → 2 gamma =1.632 -2 → 2 gamma =-0.368 → gamma =-0.184.

But gamma is always positive, so this gives a negative gamma, which is impossible. So, my approach must be wrong.

Hmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in my setup. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the invariant mass approach isn't correct here, because the initial and final states are different. The initial state is a proton and antiproton, while the final state is four A particles. So, the invariant mass squared should be the same for both. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating it.

Wait, the invariant mass squared for the initial state should be the square of the total energy minus the square of the total momentum times c.

So, s_initial = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s_initial = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Hmm, perhaps I should factor m_p^2 c^4:

s_initial = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1+gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 v^2 ) ].

Similarly, the final state's invariant mass squared is the square of the sum of the energies minus the square of the sum of the momenta times c.

But the final state has four particles, so sum E_final =4 E_A and sum p_final =4 p_A.

So,

s_final = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2.

Which can be written as:

s_final = 16 (E_A^2 - (p_A c )^2 ) =16 (m_A c^2 )^2.

So, s_final =16 m_A^4 c^4.

Now, equate s_initial and s_final:

m_p^2 c^4 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^4:

m_p^2 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

Hmm, but the problem is that this equation includes both gamma and v, which are related by gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), beta =v/c.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can make another substitution.

Let me write v as beta c → v=beta c.

So, gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), and v^2 = beta^2 c^2.

So, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 c^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

But no, wait, the substitution is in terms of beta, since v =beta c.

So, v^2 = beta^2 c^2 → gamma^2 v^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 c^2.

Wait, but this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma.

Let me write beta^2 as 1 -1/gamma^2.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 =gamma^2 (beta^2 c^2 )=gamma^2 ( (1 -1/gamma^2 ) c^2 )= gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) c^2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of gamma.

Let me compute (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2.

But beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2 → so,

(1+gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) → let's expand this.

= (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (gamma^2 -1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 +1

= 2 + 2 gamma.

So, (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 = 2 (1 + gamma).

So, substituting back, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma ) =16 m_A^2.

So,

2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma ) =16 m_A^2 → (1 + gamma )= (16 m_A^2 )/(2 m_p^2 ) → (1 + gamma )= (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_A =300 MeV/c² → m_A^2 =90000 (MeV)^2 /c^4.

m_p =938 MeV/c² → m_p^2= (938)^2 (MeV)^2 /c^4 ≈ 880,000 (MeV)^2 /c^4.

So,

(8 * 90000 ) /880000 → 720000 /880000 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma =0.818 → gamma= -0.182.

Wait, that can't be right because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1. So, negative gamma is impossible.

Hmm, so this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup. I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the invariant mass approach. Because the initial state is two particles (proton and antiproton) and the final state is four A particles, perhaps the invariant mass approach isn't directly applicable, or I made a mistake in calculating s_initial.

Wait, the invariant mass for the initial state is correct: E_initial and p_initial.

s_initial = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

But perhaps for the final state, the invariant mass is different. Because the four A particles are moving, their total energy and momentum would give a different invariant mass.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the problem in the rest frame of the proton.

In the proton's rest frame, the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the annihilation, four A particles are produced. Let's assume that their velocities are such that the total momentum is the same as p_initial.

But how are their momenta arranged? If all four are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 p_A, so 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

Each A has momentum p_A = (gamma m_p v )/(4).

Each A's energy is E_A = sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 ) / c^2 → but perhaps in terms of units where c=1, it's E_A = sqrt( (p_A )^2 + m_A^2 ).

The total energy after is 4 E_A =4 sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ).

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p + gamma m_p.

So, 4 sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ) = m_p (1 + gamma ).

Squaring both sides:

16 [ (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ] = m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ).

Rearranged:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) -16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

gamma^2 v^2 = (1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (16 m_A^2 )/m_p^2.

Hmm, but I know m_A^2/m_p^2 is (300/938 )^2 ≈0.102.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 = 1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 -16 *0.102 → 1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 -1.632.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 = (1 -1.632 ) +2 gamma + gamma^2 → gamma^2 v^2 = (-0.632 ) +2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract gamma^2 from both sides:

0 = -0.632 + 2 gamma → 2 gamma =0.632 → gamma=0.316.

But gamma must be ≥1, so this is impossible. So there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me re-express the equation.

Wait, earlier, when using the invariant mass approach, I found that 2(1 + gamma )= (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ), which gives 1 + gamma = (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ). Plugging the numbers, 8*(300^2 )/(938^2 )=8*90000/880,000≈ 720,000 /880,000 ≈0.818. So 1 + gamma=0.818 → gamma= -0.182, which is impossible.

This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, perhaps because the assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the products are moving in a way that their total momentum is zero. Wait, but then the initial momentum would have to be zero, which is not the case here.

Wait, but if the initial system has momentum, the products must also have momentum adding up to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the A particles moving at the same velocity, but in different directions. Let's say two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and each A is moving with the same speed but in opposite directions, leading to a net momentum of zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the initial energy is the sum of the rest masses plus any kinetic energies.

Wait, but the initial state consists of a proton and an antiproton. If they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta, then the total initial momentum is zero. So, in that case, the initial energy is m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

But in this case, the reaction produces four A particles, each moving in the COM frame with some velocity.

In the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the total final momentum must also be zero. So, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. That could happen if, for example, two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed but opposite directions.

Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, but that would give a non-zero total momentum, which can't be. So, they must move in such a way that their momenta sum to zero. So, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same magnitude of momentum.

So, each A has momentum p in magnitude. Let's say two have +p and two have -p. Then the total momentum is zero.

In that case, the total energy is four times the energy of each A particle.

So, in the COM frame, the initial energy is 2 m_p c², and the final energy is 4 E_A, where E_A is the energy of each A particle.

So,

4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (2 m_p c² ) /4 = (m_p c² )/2.

But E_A is also equal to gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles.

So,

gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p c² )/2 → gamma_A = (m_p )/(2 m_A )

Plugging in the numbers: m_p =938 MeV, m_A=300 MeV.

gamma_A =938/(2*300 )=938/600 ≈1.5633.

So, gamma_A ≈1.5633.

Now, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), so beta = v/c.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2 )=sqrt(1 - (1/(1.5633)^2 )).

Calculating 1.5633^2 ≈2.4433 → 1/2.4433≈0.4094.

So,

1 -0.4094=0.5906 → sqrt(0.5906 )≈0.768.

So, beta ≈0.768 → v ≈0.768c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is very close.

Wait, but this is in the COM frame, but the initial setup in the problem is in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. So, I'm not sure if this approach is valid.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which may suggest that the COM frame is not the lab frame, but perhaps this approach gives a correct answer regardless.

Wait, but in this approach, we've considered the COM frame, which is where the initial momentum is zero. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial momentum is small, but not zero. However, this approach gives an answer that's one of the options, so perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, the velocity of each A particle in the COM frame is approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Process:**  
The reaction is \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \). The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Energy and Momentum Conservation:**  
   The total energy and momentum of the system before and after the annihilation must be conserved. The initial system consists of a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly. The final system consists of four \( A \)-particles.

2. **Center-of-Momentum Frame (COM Frame):**  
   In the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. After the annihilation, the four \( A \)-particles must also have zero net momentum in this frame. This symmetry simplifies the problem.

3. **Energy in the COM Frame:**  
   The total energy in the COM frame is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2,
   \]  
   where \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

   After the annihilation, the total energy is shared equally among the four \( A \)-particles:  
   \[
   4 E_A = 2 m_p c^2 \implies E_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2}.
   \]

4. **Relating Energy to Velocity:**  
   The energy of each \( A \)-particle is related to its velocity by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:  
   \[
   E_A = \gamma m_A c^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) and \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( E_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2} \), we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
   \]  
   Plugging in \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633.
   \]

5. **Calculating Velocity:**  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), solve for \( \beta \):  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 1.5633 \):  
   \[
   \gamma^2 \approx 2.4433, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.4094, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.5906, \quad \beta \approx \sqrt{0.5906} \approx 0.768.
   \]  
   Thus, \( v \approx 0.768c \), which rounds to \( 0.77c \).

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem about annihilation, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two particles each, A⁺ and A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I think that means its velocity is much less than the speed of light, maybe non-relativistic? Or perhaps the kinetic energy is low compared to their rest mass energy. Hmm.

The given mass-energy of A is mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so I need to calculate beta (v/c) for A.

Wait, I should probably think about conservation laws here. Since the antiproton is slow, maybe the initial momentum isn't too high, but I'm not sure. Let me think about what's conserved in this process.

In annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, I need to consider their rest masses and any kinetic energy. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? So if the antiproton is moving slowly, but its rest mass is still 938 MeV. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe we can assume that the kinetic energy is much less than the rest mass energy. Or perhaps we can model this as a center-of-momentum frame thing. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, so 938 MeV each. But if they are moving towards each other, right? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some low speed. Or perhaps both are moving with some velocities. Hmm. I'm not sure about the setup there.

Wait, the problem says 'the antiproton is slowly moving' — so maybe the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, and the proton is at rest. Or perhaps both are moving towards each other, but since the antiproton is slow, their combined momentum is manageable.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we're in a frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton has low velocity. So the initial momentum would just be the momentum of the antiproton.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the initial conditions. Let me try to write down the knowns and unknowns.

Knowns:
- The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.
- mA c² = 300 MeV.
- The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe v_antip ≈ 0, or its velocity is much less than c. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is small, so its total energy is close to its rest energy.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial system (proton + antiproton) has a certain energy and momentum, and the products (the two A particles) must conserve that.

Wait, but the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ — so four particles in total. Hmm, but maybe they are emitted symmetrically. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving in some symmetric way, maybe in opposite directions.

Wait, but maybe assuming that all four A particles move in the same direction? No, that seems unlikely. More probably, they move in pairs or symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are produced symmetrically, so their momenta balance in a certain way.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial proton and antiproton. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity v. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe v is much less than c, so its gamma is approximately 1. So the total energy of the system would be the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton.

Wait, but the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c². But since it's moving slowly, gamma is ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but if v is small, then gamma is approximately 1, so the energy is approximately m_p c².

Wait, but that would make the total initial energy approximately 2 m_p c². But the rest mass of the products is 2*(m_A c²) *2? Wait, no, because there are 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻, so four particles, each with mass 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But the initial energy is 2 * m_p c², which is about 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. So the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products. So there's kinetic energy available, which goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should model this using the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial proton as being at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is gamma m_p v (since momentum p = gamma m v). The initial total energy is m_p c² + gamma m_p c². Wait, but since the antiproton is moving at velocity v, which is much less than c, gamma is approximately 1.

Wait, but I think it's better to proceed without assuming v is non-relativistic. Maybe I can't ignore relativistic effects because the products might be moving at relativistic speeds.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to consider that the initial system consists of a proton at rest and an antiproton moving with some velocity, so the total momentum is that of the antiproton. After the annihilation, the four A particles must have total momentum equal to that initial momentum.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps its energy is just m_p c², and the proton is at rest, so initial energy is about 2 m_p c². But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial system is in the center-of-momentum frame. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is small. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the reaction in the center-of-mass (COM) frame, where the total momentum is zero. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the COM frame is not the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the total momentum is small, so in the lab frame (proton at rest), the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. So in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial system's total energy is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. Wait, but that's not correct because there's kinetic energy involved.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The initial rest mass of the proton and antiproton is 2 * m_p c², but their kinetic energy adds to that.

Wait, but the initial state is a proton at rest and an antiproton moving with velocity v. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c². The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the annihilation, the four A particles must have energy E_A each, and momentum p_A each. But because the products are moving in some direction, their total momentum must equal the initial momentum.

But since there are four particles, perhaps they are moving in pairs, like two in one direction and two in the opposite. So maybe their momenta cancel out in pairs, except for their direction.

Wait, but that's not possible unless their momenta are arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, maybe all four are moving in the same direction, but that would make the total momentum large, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the case where all four A particles move in the same direction, each with momentum p. Then the total momentum after the reaction would be 4p. But that would have to equal the initial momentum, which is gamma m_p v.

But then their energies would each be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c² ?

Wait, perhaps that's a way to model it.

So, let's denote the initial momentum as P_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the reaction, the total momentum is 4 p_A, where p_A is the momentum of each A particle. So:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v → p_A = (gamma m_p v) /4.

Each A particle's energy is E_A = sqrt( (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c².

Wait, no, the energy E of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) / c².

No, wait, units are getting a bit messy. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, so E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So, E_A = sqrt( p_A² + m_A² ), where m_A is in units of energy (since c=1).

The total energy after the reaction is 4 E_A.

The total initial energy is E_initial = m_p + gamma m_p.

So, applying conservation of energy:

4 E_A = m_p (1 + gamma)

And conservation of momentum:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v → p_A = (gamma m_p v) /4.

But since E_A = sqrt( p_A² + m_A² ), substituting p_A:

E_A = sqrt( ( (gamma m_p v)/(4) )^2 + m_A^2 )

So, 4 E_A = m_p (1 + gamma )

Substituting E_A:

4 * sqrt( (gamma² m_p² v²)/(16) + m_A^2 ) = m_p (1 + gamma )

Wait, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So:

16 * [ (gamma^2 m_p² v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ] = m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2

Simplify the left side:

( gamma^2 m_p² v^2 ) + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

Hmm, let's expand that:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

I can subtract gamma^2 m_p^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma )

Wait, maybe it's better to rearrange terms. Let's bring all terms to one side:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 + 16 m_A^2 - m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma ) = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor gamma^2 m_p^2:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 - 1) + 16 m_A^2 - m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma ) = 0

But this seems complicated. Maybe I need to make some approximations. The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is much less than c. So maybe gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c^2), but since v is small, perhaps gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2). Hmm, but in terms of units where c=1, yes.

Wait, but in terms of units where c=1, v is a dimensionless fraction (like 0.1c would be 0.1). So, if v is small, then gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/2.

Wait, but maybe even that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the antiproton's velocity is such that its gamma is roughly 1, so we can approximate gamma as 1.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, then v is much less than c, so gamma is approximately 1. So, let's make that approximation. So gamma ≈ 1.

So, substituting gamma ≈ 1 into the equation.

Then, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 → m_p^2 v^2 (since gamma≈1)

And the right side becomes m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) ≈ m_p^2 (1 + 2*1 + 1) = m_p^2 *4.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me plug gamma=1 into the equation:

gamma^2 m_p² v^2 +16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 )

=> m_p² v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 + 1) = 4 m_p^2.

Rearranged:

m_p² v^2 = 4 m_p^2 - 16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by m_p²:

v^2 = 4 - (16 m_A^2)/(m_p^2 )

But let's plug in the numbers.

m_A c² = 300 MeV → m_A = 300 MeV/c².

m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV → m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So, m_A / m_p = 300/938 ≈ 0.3195.

So, (m_A/m_p)^2 ≈ 0.3195^2 ≈ 0.102.

So, 16 (m_A/m_p)^2 ≈ 16 * 0.102 ≈ 1.632.

So, v² = 4 - 1.632 = 2.368.

But v² can't be more than 1 (since v is in units of c), so that's a problem. That implies v² is 2.368, which is greater than 1, which would mean v > c, which is impossible.

Hmm, so that suggests our assumption that gamma =1 is invalid. Because the result is impossible. So maybe the approximation that gamma ≈1 is not good enough.

So, perhaps gamma can't be approximated as 1. Therefore, we need to find a way to solve this without making that approximation. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the initial system is a proton and an antiproton moving towards each other with velocities v and -v, so that their momenta are equal and opposite. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Alternatively, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity v.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the initial system: a proton at rest (so momentum zero) and an antiproton moving with velocity v. So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

After the annihilation, the four A particles are produced. Let's assume that each A has the same energy and momentum, but I'm not sure about their directions. To simplify, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the antiproton. But that might not be the case, but let's try.

So, each A has momentum p and energy E. So, total momentum after is 4p, which must equal p_initial = γ m_p v.

So, 4p = γ m_p v → p = γ m_p v /4.

The energy of each A is E = γ_A m_A c², where γ_A is the Lorentz factor for particle A. Alternatively, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c².

Wait, perhaps I should write E in terms of p.

So, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) / c² → no, wait, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c² )^2 ) / c²? No, wait, no, units-wise, when using E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), then E is in energy units. So, E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me get the units right. Momentum p is in kg m/s. Multiply by c (m/s) → (kg m²/s²) which is energy in joules. So, (p c) is energy. Similarly, m c² is energy. So sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 ) is sqrt of (energy)^2 + (energy)^2 → which is energy. So E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, each A has energy E = sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

So, the total energy after is 4 E = 4 * sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

But p is given by 4p = gamma m_p v → p = (gamma m_p v )/(4)

Wait, but we can write:

E = sqrt( ( (gamma m_p v c )/(4) )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 )

So, total energy after reaction is 4 E = 4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 c^4 )

And the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

So, setting 4 E = E_initial → 4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 c^2 )/(16) + (m_A c^2 )^2 ) = (1 + gamma) m_p c^2.

Divide both sides by c^2:

4 * sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ) = (1 + gamma) m_p.

Square both sides:

16 [ (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16) + m_A^2 ] = (1 + gamma)^2 m_p^2.

Simplify the left side:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 /16 *16 ? Wait, no, 16 multiplied by each term inside the sqrt.

Wait, no, when you square 4 * sqrt(...), you get 16 * (...).

So:

16 [ (gamma² m_p² v² )/(16) + m_A² ] = (1 + gamma )^2 m_p^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 + 16 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma )^2 m_p^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

So, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Subtract gamma^2 m_p^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 = (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2.

Factor left side:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 -1) +16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

gamma^2 m_p^2 (v^2 - 1) +16 m_A^2 - (1 + 2 gamma ) m_p^2 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can divide through by m_p^2 to make the equation dimensionless.

Let me define some variables to simplify:

Let x = v^2 → since v is in units of c.

Let β = v/c → x = β^2.

Let gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Let me express everything in terms of beta and gamma.

So, the equation becomes:

gamma^2 (beta^2) m_p^2 + 16 m_A^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Wait, perhaps substituting m_A = 300 MeV/c² and m_p = 938 MeV/c².

Let me compute the ratio (m_A/m_p)²: (300/938)^2 ≈ (0.3195)^2 ≈ 0.102.

So, 16 m_A^2 = 16 * 0.102 m_p^2 ≈ 1.632 m_p^2.

So, the equation is:

gamma^2 beta^2 m_p^2 +1.632 m_p^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) m_p^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

gamma^2 beta^2 + 1.632 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 beta^2 +1.632 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

gamma^2 beta^2 + 0.632 = 2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract gamma^2 from both sides:

gamma^2 beta^2 +0.632 - gamma^2 = 2 gamma.

Factor gamma^2:

gamma^2 (beta^2 -1 ) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

But beta^2 = v^2/c^2 → beta^2 = v^2 → but since v is the velocity of the antiproton, which is moving at speed v, beta is v/c. So, beta^2 = (v^2)/(c^2) = beta^2, so in terms of units, beta is v/c.

Wait, perhaps there's another substitution. Remember that gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2).

Hmm, substituting this into the equation:

[1/(1 - beta^2)] (beta^2 -1 ) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

Wait, but (beta^2 -1 ) = -(1 - beta^2 ), so:

[1/(1-beta^2)] * (- (1 - beta^2 )) +0.632 = 2 gamma.

Which simplifies to:

-1 +0.632 = 2 gamma → -0.368 = 2 gamma.

But gamma is always positive, so this can't be correct. So, there must be a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Maybe the A particles are moving in a way that their momenta cancel each other out except for the initial momentum. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving symmetrically, so their total momentum is zero, except for some residual.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in pairs, such that their momenta cancel each other.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the A particles are moving with velocity much less than c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the kinetic energy of the initial antiproton is negligible, so we can treat the system as being in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the velocity of the products using the invariant quantities.

Wait, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

In the initial state, sum E is m_p c² + gamma m_p c² and sum p is gamma m_p v.

So, the invariant mass squared is (E_total c)^2 - (p_total c^2 )^2.

Wait, but let me compute that.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So, invariant mass squared s = (E_initial c )^2 - (p_initial c^2 )^2.

Wait, no, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

Because energy is E, and momentum is p, so (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

So, s = [ (1+gamma) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

This should be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products.

Wait, the products are four A particles, each with rest mass m_A. So, the rest mass energy is 4 m_A c².

Wait, no, because each A has rest mass m_A, so four of them have rest mass energy 4 m_A c².

But wait, the invariant mass squared for the products would be (sum E)^2 - (sum p c )^2.

But in their rest frame, sum E = 4 m_A c² and sum p =0. So, the invariant mass squared is (4 m_A c² )^2.

So, setting the initial s equal to the final s:

[ (1+gamma) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2 = (4 m_A c² )^2.

Divide both sides by c^4:

[ (1+gamma )^2 m_p^2 - gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 ] = 16 m_A^2.

Factor m_p^2:

m_p^2 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] = 16 m_A^2.

Expand (1+gamma )^2 → 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2.

So,

m_p^2 [1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me plug in the values in terms of ratios.

Given m_A c² =300 MeV and m_p c²=938 MeV.

So, m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p =938 MeV/c².

So, m_A/m_p = 300/938 ≈0.3195.

So, the equation becomes:

(938)^2 [ ... ] = 16 (300)^2.

But perhaps it's better to compute the ratio (m_A/m_p ) = 300/938 ≈0.3195.

So, 16 (m_A/m_p )^2 =16 (0.3195)^2 ≈16 * 0.102 ≈1.632.

So, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 -v^2 ) ] = 1.632 m_p^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 -v^2 ) =1.632.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I can express (1 -v^2 ) in terms of gamma.

Since gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), where beta = v/c, so beta^2 = v^2/c^2 → v^2 = beta^2 c².

So, 1 - v^2 =1 - beta^2 c² → but since v is in terms of c, beta^2 is v^2/c^2 → 1 -v^2 = 1 - (beta^2 c^2 ) → Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of beta = v/c.

So, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So, 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2.

So, (1 -v^2 ) =1 - beta^2 c^2 → but wait, v^2 =beta^2 c^2 → 1 -v^2/c^2 = 1 -beta^2 → which is 1/gamma^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, in terms of beta = v/c, gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

So, 1 - beta^2 = 1/gamma^2 → beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2.

So, substituting into the equation:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 (1 - beta^2 ) = 1.632.

Which becomes:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2*(1/gamma^2 ) = 1.632.

Because 1 - beta^2 =1/gamma^2.

So,

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2*(1/gamma^2 ) =1 +2 gamma +1 =2 + 2 gamma.

So,

2 + 2 gamma =1.632 → 2 gamma =1.632 -2 → 2 gamma =-0.368 → gamma =-0.184.

But gamma is always positive, so this gives a negative gamma, which is impossible. So, my approach must be wrong.

Hmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in my setup. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the invariant mass approach isn't correct here, because the initial and final states are different. The initial state is a proton and antiproton, while the final state is four A particles. So, the invariant mass squared should be the same for both. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculating it.

Wait, the invariant mass squared for the initial state should be the square of the total energy minus the square of the total momentum times c.

So, s_initial = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

E_initial = m_p c^2 + gamma m_p c^2.

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

s_initial = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Hmm, perhaps I should factor m_p^2 c^4:

s_initial = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1+gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 v^2 ) ].

Similarly, the final state's invariant mass squared is the square of the sum of the energies minus the square of the sum of the momenta times c.

But the final state has four particles, so sum E_final =4 E_A and sum p_final =4 p_A.

So,

s_final = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2.

Which can be written as:

s_final = 16 (E_A^2 - (p_A c )^2 ) =16 (m_A c^2 )^2.

So, s_final =16 m_A^4 c^4.

Now, equate s_initial and s_final:

m_p^2 c^4 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^4:

m_p^2 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 v^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

Hmm, but the problem is that this equation includes both gamma and v, which are related by gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), beta =v/c.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can make another substitution.

Let me write v as beta c → v=beta c.

So, gamma =1/ sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), and v^2 = beta^2 c^2.

So, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 [ (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 c^2 ] =16 m_A^2.

But no, wait, the substitution is in terms of beta, since v =beta c.

So, v^2 = beta^2 c^2 → gamma^2 v^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 c^2.

Wait, but this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of gamma.

Let me write beta^2 as 1 -1/gamma^2.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 =gamma^2 (beta^2 c^2 )=gamma^2 ( (1 -1/gamma^2 ) c^2 )= gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) c^2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of gamma.

Let me compute (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2.

But beta^2 =1 -1/gamma^2 → so,

(1+gamma)^2 - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) → let's expand this.

= (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (gamma^2 -1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 +1

= 2 + 2 gamma.

So, (1+gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 = 2 (1 + gamma).

So, substituting back, the equation becomes:

m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma ) =16 m_A^2.

So,

2 m_p^2 (1 + gamma ) =16 m_A^2 → (1 + gamma )= (16 m_A^2 )/(2 m_p^2 ) → (1 + gamma )= (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_A =300 MeV/c² → m_A^2 =90000 (MeV)^2 /c^4.

m_p =938 MeV/c² → m_p^2= (938)^2 (MeV)^2 /c^4 ≈ 880,000 (MeV)^2 /c^4.

So,

(8 * 90000 ) /880000 → 720000 /880000 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma =0.818 → gamma= -0.182.

Wait, that can't be right because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1. So, negative gamma is impossible.

Hmm, so this suggests that there's a mistake in the setup. I must have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the invariant mass approach. Because the initial state is two particles (proton and antiproton) and the final state is four A particles, perhaps the invariant mass approach isn't directly applicable, or I made a mistake in calculating s_initial.

Wait, the invariant mass for the initial state is correct: E_initial and p_initial.

s_initial = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

But perhaps for the final state, the invariant mass is different. Because the four A particles are moving, their total energy and momentum would give a different invariant mass.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's think about the problem in the rest frame of the proton.

In the proton's rest frame, the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After the annihilation, four A particles are produced. Let's assume that their velocities are such that the total momentum is the same as p_initial.

But how are their momenta arranged? If all four are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 p_A, so 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

Each A has momentum p_A = (gamma m_p v )/(4).

Each A's energy is E_A = sqrt( (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2 ) / c^2 → but perhaps in terms of units where c=1, it's E_A = sqrt( (p_A )^2 + m_A^2 ).

The total energy after is 4 E_A =4 sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ).

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p + gamma m_p.

So, 4 sqrt( (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ) = m_p (1 + gamma ).

Squaring both sides:

16 [ (gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 )/(16 ) + m_A^2 ] = m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

Simplify:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 +16 m_A^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ).

Rearranged:

gamma^2 m_p^2 v^2 = m_p^2 (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) -16 m_A^2.

Divide both sides by m_p^2:

gamma^2 v^2 = (1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - (16 m_A^2 )/m_p^2.

Hmm, but I know m_A^2/m_p^2 is (300/938 )^2 ≈0.102.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 = 1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 -16 *0.102 → 1 +2 gamma + gamma^2 -1.632.

So,

gamma^2 v^2 = (1 -1.632 ) +2 gamma + gamma^2 → gamma^2 v^2 = (-0.632 ) +2 gamma + gamma^2.

Subtract gamma^2 from both sides:

0 = -0.632 + 2 gamma → 2 gamma =0.632 → gamma=0.316.

But gamma must be ≥1, so this is impossible. So there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me re-express the equation.

Wait, earlier, when using the invariant mass approach, I found that 2(1 + gamma )= (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ), which gives 1 + gamma = (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ). Plugging the numbers, 8*(300^2 )/(938^2 )=8*90000/880,000≈ 720,000 /880,000 ≈0.818. So 1 + gamma=0.818 → gamma= -0.182, which is impossible.

This suggests that the initial approach is incorrect, perhaps because the assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the products are moving in a way that their total momentum is zero. Wait, but then the initial momentum would have to be zero, which is not the case here.

Wait, but if the initial system has momentum, the products must also have momentum adding up to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have the A particles moving at the same velocity, but in different directions. Let's say two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and each A is moving with the same speed but in opposite directions, leading to a net momentum of zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So, the initial energy is the sum of the rest masses plus any kinetic energies.

Wait, but the initial state consists of a proton and an antiproton. If they're moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta, then the total initial momentum is zero. So, in that case, the initial energy is m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

But in this case, the reaction produces four A particles, each moving in the COM frame with some velocity.

In the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the total final momentum must also be zero. So, the four A particles must have zero net momentum. That could happen if, for example, two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same speed but opposite directions.

Alternatively, perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, but that would give a non-zero total momentum, which can't be. So, they must move in such a way that their momenta sum to zero. So, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, each with the same magnitude of momentum.

So, each A has momentum p in magnitude. Let's say two have +p and two have -p. Then the total momentum is zero.

In that case, the total energy is four times the energy of each A particle.

So, in the COM frame, the initial energy is 2 m_p c², and the final energy is 4 E_A, where E_A is the energy of each A particle.

So,

4 E_A = 2 m_p c² → E_A = (2 m_p c² ) /4 = (m_p c² )/2.

But E_A is also equal to gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles.

So,

gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p c² )/2 → gamma_A = (m_p )/(2 m_A )

Plugging in the numbers: m_p =938 MeV, m_A=300 MeV.

gamma_A =938/(2*300 )=938/600 ≈1.5633.

So, gamma_A ≈1.5633.

Now, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), so beta = v/c.

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2 )=sqrt(1 - (1/(1.5633)^2 )).

Calculating 1.5633^2 ≈2.4433 → 1/2.4433≈0.4094.

So,

1 -0.4094=0.5906 → sqrt(0.5906 )≈0.768.

So, beta ≈0.768 → v ≈0.768c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is very close.

Wait, but this is in the COM frame, but the initial setup in the problem is in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. So, I'm not sure if this approach is valid.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which may suggest that the COM frame is not the lab frame, but perhaps this approach gives a correct answer regardless.

Wait, but in this approach, we've considered the COM frame, which is where the initial momentum is zero. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial momentum is small, but not zero. However, this approach gives an answer that's one of the options, so perhaps this is the correct approach.

So, the velocity of each A particle in the COM frame is approximately 0.768c, which rounds to 0.77c, option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Process:**  
The reaction is \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \). The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Energy and Momentum Conservation:**  
   The total energy and momentum of the system before and after the annihilation must be conserved. The initial system consists of a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly. The final system consists of four \( A \)-particles.

2. **Center-of-Momentum Frame (COM Frame):**  
   In the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. After the annihilation, the four \( A \)-particles must also have zero net momentum in this frame. This symmetry simplifies the problem.

3. **Energy in the COM Frame:**  
   The total energy in the COM frame is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_p c^2 + m_p c^2 = 2 m_p c^2,
   \]  
   where \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

   After the annihilation, the total energy is shared equally among the four \( A \)-particles:  
   \[
   4 E_A = 2 m_p c^2 \implies E_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2}.
   \]

4. **Relating Energy to Velocity:**  
   The energy of each \( A \)-particle is related to its velocity by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:  
   \[
   E_A = \gamma m_A c^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) and \( \beta = v/c \). Substituting \( E_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2} \), we find:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
   \]  
   Plugging in \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633.
   \]

5. **Calculating Velocity:**  
   Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), solve for \( \beta \):  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 1.5633 \):  
   \[
   \gamma^2 \approx 2.4433, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.4094, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.5906, \quad \beta \approx \sqrt{0.5906} \approx 0.768.
   \]  
   Thus, \( v \approx 0.768c \), which rounds to \( 0.77c \).

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
