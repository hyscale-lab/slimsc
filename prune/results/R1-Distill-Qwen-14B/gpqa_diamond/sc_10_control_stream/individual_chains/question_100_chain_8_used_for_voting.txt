Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each reaction and identifying the compounds involved.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Wait, what's the structure of C3H6? I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 can correspond to either propene or propane. But wait, propene is C3H6 (since it's CH2=CHCH3) and propane is C3H8. So wait, the formula given is C3H6, so that's either a propene (alkene) or maybe a cyclopropane? Hmm. Well, given that it undergoes bromination in CCl4, which is a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So I think A is propene.

So Compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3?), wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Right, that's correct.

First reaction: Bromination in the presence of CCl4. So that's a bromination of an alkene. The bromine adds across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, more accurately, it would add across the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, specifically E2. So when a dibromide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it typically undergoes dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr and forming an alkene. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH (alcohol) would eliminate HBr twice. Where would the double bond form? The possible alkenes are between carbons 1-2 or 2-3. Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane), elimination would typically form the more substituted alkene. So in this case, eliminating from 1,2-dibromopropane would give us either propene or maybe another structure. Let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, it adds across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. The positions of elimination would be from adjacent carbons, so the double bond would form between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3. Wait, but the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when you eliminate HBr from the first and second carbons, you get CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. Alternatively, eliminating from the second and third would give CH3CH=CH2, which is 1-propene but same as propene. Wait, but wait: the structure after elimination from CH2BrCHBrCH3 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in CH2=CHCH2Br? No, wait, that can't be right because elimination would take away two Brs. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the starting material is CH2=CHCH3 (Compound A). Brominating it would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when you treat this with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

Wait, for 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, it will be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when you eliminate two HBr molecules, the possible alkenes are either CH2=CHCH3 or CH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond between the two central carbons, right? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of it as: the dibromide is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with KOH (alcohol), each Br is on adjacent carbons. So during elimination, H is abstracted from a β carbon. Let's say, abstracting H from the CH2Br group: the H from CH2Br (the first carbon) and the Br on the second. So the double bond forms between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH2Br. Wait, but that would leave a Br on the third carbon, which isn't right. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination of propene (CH2=CHCH3) with Br2 in CCl4 results in 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a base, it will eliminate HBr. The elimination would occur between the two Br atoms. So the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the possible products are 1-propene or 2-propene, but since the starting material is symmetric, it might form a mixture. Wait, no, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, so the central carbon has two Brs. Wait, no, each Br is on adjacent carbons, so C1 and C2 each have a Br. So when elimination occurs, the double bond forms between C1 and C2, leading to CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. Wait, but that's the same as the starting material. So compound C would be propene.

Wait, but that seems like a cycle. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, because the initial reaction was adding Br2 across the double bond, but then elimination would give the same structure. But wait, that would imply that C is the same as A. But the next step is that C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D.

Wait, perhaps compound C isn't propene. Maybe the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the initial product.

Wait, when propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2, the addition is across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is an E2 elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination can occur between the two Brs. So, the base abstracts a β hydrogen from one of the carbons bearing Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be an alkene. But since the starting material after bromination is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would give back propene. That seems a bit circular, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but wait, if that's the case, then compound C would be propene again. Then, what's the next step? Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for decomposition. Wait, but if C is propene, then passing it through a red-hot iron tube might cause a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of compound B.

Wait, maybe compound A is not propene. Let me think again. The formula is C3H6. Another possibility is cyclopropane, which is a three-membered ring with all single bonds. But cyclopropane is less likely in this context because bromination of cyclopropane typically doesn't add Br2 in the same way as alkenes. So probably, A is propene.

Wait, but let me think differently. If A is propene, then bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives back propene, which would be compound C. Then, passing propene through a red-hot iron tube—what reaction is that? I think that could be dehydrohalogenation, but wait, propene is already an alkene. Or perhaps, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it might cause some cracking or decomposition. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction, but propene is already an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the steps:

1. A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene again (CH2=CHCH3)
4. Passing through red-hot iron → perhaps dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the iron is a catalyst for something else. Wait, another thought: when alkenes are treated with red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction. But that would require H2, which isn't present. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the dibromide (compound B) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it forms a different product. Let me think again about the structure. If compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3?), no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3, which is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. So, the possible products are 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is symmetric, so elimination would give the same product regardless of which side the hydrogen is abstracted from. So compound C would be propene again.

Then, passing C (propene) through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, another possibility: perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation, but propene doesn't have any halides. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is a catalyst for some kind of cracking. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Hmm, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Wait, maybe compound B isn't 1,2-dibromopropane. Let me think: when propene reacts with Br2, it's a dibromide addition. But wait, maybe in this case, the addition is a vicinal dihalide, which is 1,2-dibromopropane. So, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But the structure would depend on where the elimination occurs. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a different alkene. For instance, if the starting material is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, elimination could form either CH2=CHCH3 (propene) or CH3CHBr=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because elimination removes the Brs. Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-butadiene? No, that's not possible because we're dealing with propane derivatives.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it out mentally. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding CH2=CHCH3 again. So compound C is propene.

Then, what happens when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube? I'm a bit stuck here. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of hydrogenation, but without H2, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the reaction conditions. Maybe the iron is a reducing agent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should move forward and see what the subsequent reactions are. Let's say compound D is formed. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids—could that be H2SO4 and H2SO3 (sulfuric and sulfurous acid)? Or maybe HNO3 and H2SO4, but not sure. Alternatively, it could be a mixture like H2SO4 and HCl, but perhaps it's a nitrating mixture. But wait, in some reactions, like the preparation of nitration, a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 is used.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structure of D. If C is propene, and we pass it through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes some kind of addition or reaction to form another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a ring formation. Wait, another thought: if propene is passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's undergoing a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial reaction produces a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the bromination isn't adding Br2 but is a substitution. Wait, no—bromination in CCl4 usually refers to addition across double bonds, not substitution. So I think the initial steps are correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong product for the elimination step. Let me think again: 1,2-dibromopropane treated with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules and form an alkene. The possible alkenes are 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) and 2-propene (CH3CH=CH2), but wait, that's the same as propene since propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, no, CH3CH=CH2 is 1-propene, but that's actually the same as propene. So perhaps the product is propene.

So back to step 4: propene passed through red-hot iron. Maybe that's a hydrogenation catalyst? But without H2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the propene is being dehydrohalogenated again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some kind of isomerization, but propene is already an alkene.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something in the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the product after elimination isn't propene but another alkene. Wait, perhaps the initial dibromide is actually 1,2-dibromopropane, and upon elimination, it forms another structure. Wait, perhaps the elimination forms cyclopropane? No, that would require a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces something else. Wait, maybe the red-hot iron is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but the compound is already an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here and need to think differently.

Let's move forward. Suppose compound D is something else. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Looking at the options, perhaps D is propane. Then, reaction with two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and HCl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if D is propane, reacting with strong acids might not do much. But perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps when propene is passed through a hot iron tube, it's being converted into something like propyne? That is, an alkyne. How? Perhaps through a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require HX. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is acting as a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation, but without HX, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction isn't propene. Maybe A is cyclopropane. Let me check: cyclopropane (C3H6) would react with bromine in CCl4. But cyclopropane is strained and can undergo bromination, but I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that's with dienes.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it another way.

Let me map out each step with possible compounds:

A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, as propene has a double bond between C1 and C2, so adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.
C: B + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene again (CH2=CHCH3)
D: C (propene) passed through red-hot iron → suppose it's something else, like perhaps propyne (CH≡CCH3) via dehydrohalogenation, but without HX, that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's being hydrogenated. But without H2, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a ring formation. For example, propene could cyclize into cyclopropane. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound D is propane (C3H8). How would that happen? If propene is treated with a reducing agent. But without H2, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction with the red-hot iron is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is incorrect. Let me think again. What if A is not propene but cyclopropane?

If A is cyclopropane (C3H6), then bromination in CCl4 might lead to a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, cyclopropane could add bromine across a ring. But I'm not certain about that product. Alternatively, perhaps the bromination would lead to a bromocyclopropane. Then, treatment with alcoholic KOH might cause an elimination, perhaps opening the ring. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the possibility that A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and C is propene again. Then, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's being converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration to form something else, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which statements might be incorrect.

Option D says that C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas, then yes, it's flammable. So option D would be correct, so the incorrect statement would be elsewhere.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenol groups. So H would have a phenol group if this is true.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. That would mean D has two sets of equivalent protons. If D is propane, its NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. Alternatively, if D is something else, perhaps with two sets of equivalent protons, like maybe a di-substituted alkene.

Option A says F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F would be something like benzene or another aromatic compound. If F is benzene, that's used in dye synthesis.

Wait, but let's try to think step by step again, perhaps I missed a key reaction.

Let's re-examine the steps:

1. A (C3H6) → bromination → B (dibromide)
2. B → alcoholic KOH → C (propene)
3. C → red-hot iron → D
4. D → two strong acids → E
5. E → iron scrap and HCl → F
6. F → nitrous acid → G
7. G → NaOH → H

If I can't figure out D, maybe I should think about the subsequent steps.

Suppose D is propane (C3H8). Then, reacting with two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and H2SO3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and E is something else.

Alternatively, if D is propane and reacted with H2SO4 and another acid, perhaps it's a sulfonation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene. Then, reacting with strong acids might not do much, unless it's a nitrating mixture, but propene isn't typically nitrated under such conditions.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step's possible products and see if any of the options are incorrect.

Another approach: let's think about each product.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas, that's correct. So option D is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That suggests H has a phenol group. So when G reacts with NaOH to form H, perhaps H is phenol?

Wait, let's think about G. G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, which can undergo various reactions. Alternatively, if F is an aromatic amine, reacting with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt, which could decompose to form a phenol under certain conditions.

Wait, but let's think about F. F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. That's a typical condition for the reduction of a nitro compound to an amine. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

So, E → F: nitro → amine.

G is formed when F (amine) reacts with nitrous acid. That would form a diazonium salt, which could then decompose, perhaps in the presence of water to form a phenol (H).

So H would be phenol, which would give a yellow color with ferric chloride (option B is correct).

So option B is correct, so the incorrect statement can't be B.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, like aniline, which is used in dye synthesis, then A is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. Let's imagine D's structure. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), the NMR would show a single singlet for the six equivalent H's on the CH3 groups. So that's only one singlet, not two. So option C would be incorrect. Alternatively, if D is something else, like maybe 1-propanol, the NMR would have different signals.

Wait, if D is propane, then 1H NMR would show a singlet. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect. So option C could be the incorrect statement. Alternatively, if D is another compound, like maybe 1,2-dibromopropane, but that doesn't fit with the steps. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is propene. Propene's NMR would have two sets of protons: the two CH2 groups and the CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The protons on the CH2= would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH. The CH3 would be a triplet as well. So the NMR would show a triplet and a triplet, but maybe as two singlets if there's some symmetry, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back and re-examine the step where C is passed through a red-hot iron tube.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction with red-hot iron is a dehydrohalogenation, but C is propene, which doesn't have any halogens. So perhaps D is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial steps. Let's think again about compound B and C.

If A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then C is propene again after elimination. Then, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of cracking, but without H2, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a decomposition reaction, like breaking the propene into smaller molecules. But that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the red-hot iron is causing the propene to form acetylene (propyne). How? Propyne is HC≡C-CH3. To form that from propene, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation with a strong base, but without HX, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but without H2O or another oxidizing agent, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that D is something else, like maybe cyclopropane. But how?

Another approach: Perhaps the first reaction isn't adding Br2 but substituting. But no, bromination in CCl4 is typically addition for alkenes.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is not propene but another C3H6 isomer.

Wait, C3H6 can also be cyclopropane. So let's consider that possibility.

If A is cyclopropane (C3H6), then bromination in CCl4 might add Br across a ring, perhaps forming bromocyclopropane. Then, treating with alcoholic KOH could cause elimination, perhaps opening the ring. But I'm not sure about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination would substitute a hydrogen with Br, but that's less likely in CCl4.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step, even if I'm not entirely confident.

Let me try to outline the reaction steps with possible compounds:

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. Bromination → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. Alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) → Compound C is propene.
4. Propene passed through red-hot iron → D. What could D be? Maybe propane (CH3CH2CH3) via some reduction or hydrogenation, but without H2, perhaps another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), but I'm not sure how that forms.

Wait, maybe the red-hot iron is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but propene doesn't have any halogens. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalyst for a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the iron is causing the propene to decompose into something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that D is propane. Then, when D (propane) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing sulfonation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

But let's proceed. Suppose D is propane.

5. D → reacts with two strong acids → E. If the two acids are H2SO4 and H2SO3, perhaps E is something like propanesulfonic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and E is something else. But this is getting too vague.

Another approach: let's think about the final steps.

6. E → reacts with Fe and HCl → F. Fe and HCl are conditions for the reduction of nitro compounds to amines. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

7. F → reacts with nitrous acid → G. That would form a diazonium salt, which can undergo various reactions, like decomposition to form a phenol or coupling reactions.

8. G → NaOH → H. If H is phenol, then it would give a yellow color with ferric chloride (option B correct).

So, F would be an aromatic amine. Thus, E would be a nitro compound.

So, to have E as a nitro compound, what must D be?

If D is propene, reacting with two strong acids might not form a nitro compound. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key step. Let me think: if D is benzene, then reacting with a mixture of strong acids (like HNO3 and H2SO4) would nitrate it, forming nitrobenzene (E). Then, E (nitrobenzene) would be reduced with Fe and HCl to form aniline (F). Then, F (aniline) reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium chloride (G), which upon treatment with NaOH would form phenol (H), which gives a positive test with ferric chloride.

But wait, how would D be benzene? Let's see the steps leading to D.

If C is propene, and D is benzene, that implies a major structural change. Perhaps D is formed via a series of reactions that I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, which then undergoes some reaction to form benzene, but that's unlikely without a lot of steps.

Hmm, perhaps the earlier steps are leading towards benzene. Let's re-examine.

If A is propene:

- Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane.
- Alcoholic KOH gives propene again.
- Passing through red-hot iron → perhaps some kind of cyclization or hydrogenation. Wait, if propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's being dehydrohalogenated to form something else, but earlier steps don't have any halogens. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing a cracking reaction, but without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane, the NMR would show a singlet for the six equivalent H's. So option C would be incorrect because it's only one singlet, not two. So the incorrect statement would be option C.

But wait, what if D is something else, like maybe 1,2-dibromopropane again? No, because C is propene, and D is after passing through iron.

Alternatively, if D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), its NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 group and a different signal for the triple bond protons. But propyne's structure is HC≡C-CH3, so the CH3 would be a singlet, and the HC≡C would have another set of protons. Wait, no, the triple bond protons are only on the terminal carbon, so they would be split based on neighboring groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is 1-bromopropane. Then, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2Br and a triplet for the CH2CH3, but that's not two singlets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming D is propane. Let me think again.

If D is cyclopropane, its NMR would have a singlet for all six equivalent H's, so only one singlet. So option C (two singlets) would be incorrect.

But how could D be cyclopropane? Let me think about the steps. If C is propene, and then it's passed through red-hot iron, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-closing reaction to form cyclopropane. That would make sense if the iron is acting as a catalyst for such a reaction.

So, if D is cyclopropane, then its NMR would have a singlet, making option C incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. Because if D is cyclopropane, it would give a single singlet, not two.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A, identified as propene (C3H6), based on its molecular formula and the context of bromination in carbon tetrachloride, which typically targets alkenes. Bromination of propene adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, regenerating propene (Compound C). 

When Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a reaction to form Compound D. Based on the conditions, this step likely involves a cyclization reaction, forming cyclopropane (C3H6). Cyclopropane is a strained ring structure with all hydrogens equivalent, resulting in a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Compound D (cyclopropane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, potentially forming a nitro compound (Compound E). Subsequent reduction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid produces aniline (Compound F), an aromatic amine. Reaction of F with nitrous acid forms a diazonium salt (Compound G), which reacts with sodium hydroxide to yield phenol (Compound H). Phenol reacts positively with ferric chloride, giving a yellow color.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F (aniline) is indeed used for the synthesis of dyes. This is correct.
- **Option B**: H (phenol) gives a yellow color with ferric chloride, which is consistent with the reaction. This is correct.
- **Option C**: D (cyclopropane) has all six hydrogens equivalent, resulting in a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. The statement that D gives two singlets is incorrect.
- **Option D**: C (propene) is a flammable gas, which is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as cyclopropane does not give two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each reaction and identifying the compounds involved.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Wait, what's the structure of C3H6? I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 can correspond to either propene or propane. But wait, propene is C3H6 (since it's CH2=CHCH3) and propane is C3H8. So wait, the formula given is C3H6, so that's either a propene (alkene) or maybe a cyclopropane? Hmm. Well, given that it undergoes bromination in CCl4, which is a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So I think A is propene.

So Compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3?), wait no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Right, that's correct.

First reaction: Bromination in the presence of CCl4. So that's a bromination of an alkene. The bromine adds across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, more accurately, it would add across the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, specifically E2. So when a dibromide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it typically undergoes dehydrohalogenation, eliminating two molecules of HBr and forming an alkene. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH (alcohol) would eliminate HBr twice. Where would the double bond form? The possible alkenes are between carbons 1-2 or 2-3. Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromopropane), elimination would typically form the more substituted alkene. So in this case, eliminating from 1,2-dibromopropane would give us either propene or maybe another structure. Let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, it adds across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when B is treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. The positions of elimination would be from adjacent carbons, so the double bond would form between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3. Wait, but the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when you eliminate HBr from the first and second carbons, you get CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. Alternatively, eliminating from the second and third would give CH3CH=CH2, which is 1-propene but same as propene. Wait, but wait: the structure after elimination from CH2BrCHBrCH3 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in CH2=CHCH2Br? No, wait, that can't be right because elimination would take away two Brs. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the starting material is CH2=CHCH3 (Compound A). Brominating it would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when you treat this with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

Wait, for 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, it will be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when you eliminate two HBr molecules, the possible alkenes are either CH2=CHCH3 or CH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond between the two central carbons, right? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of it as: the dibromide is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with KOH (alcohol), each Br is on adjacent carbons. So during elimination, H is abstracted from a β carbon. Let's say, abstracting H from the CH2Br group: the H from CH2Br (the first carbon) and the Br on the second. So the double bond forms between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH2Br. Wait, but that would leave a Br on the third carbon, which isn't right. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Wait, perhaps the initial bromination of propene (CH2=CHCH3) with Br2 in CCl4 results in 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a base, it will eliminate HBr. The elimination would occur between the two Br atoms. So the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the possible products are 1-propene or 2-propene, but since the starting material is symmetric, it might form a mixture. Wait, no, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, so the central carbon has two Brs. Wait, no, each Br is on adjacent carbons, so C1 and C2 each have a Br. So when elimination occurs, the double bond forms between C1 and C2, leading to CH2=CHCH3, which is propene again. Wait, but that's the same as the starting material. So compound C would be propene.

Wait, but that seems like a cycle. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, because the initial reaction was adding Br2 across the double bond, but then elimination would give the same structure. But wait, that would imply that C is the same as A. But the next step is that C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to form D.

Wait, perhaps compound C isn't propene. Maybe the elimination leads to a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the initial product.

Wait, when propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2, the addition is across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is an E2 elimination. Each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination can occur between the two Brs. So, the base abstracts a β hydrogen from one of the carbons bearing Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product would be an alkene. But since the starting material after bromination is 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would give back propene. That seems a bit circular, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but wait, if that's the case, then compound C would be propene again. Then, what's the next step? Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for decomposition. Wait, but if C is propene, then passing it through a red-hot iron tube might cause a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of compound B.

Wait, maybe compound A is not propene. Let me think again. The formula is C3H6. Another possibility is cyclopropane, which is a three-membered ring with all single bonds. But cyclopropane is less likely in this context because bromination of cyclopropane typically doesn't add Br2 in the same way as alkenes. So probably, A is propene.

Wait, but let me think differently. If A is propene, then bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives back propene, which would be compound C. Then, passing propene through a red-hot iron tube—what reaction is that? I think that could be dehydrohalogenation, but wait, propene is already an alkene. Or perhaps, when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it might cause some cracking or decomposition. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction, but propene is already an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the steps:

1. A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. Bromination in CCl4 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. Reaction with alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene again (CH2=CHCH3)
4. Passing through red-hot iron → perhaps dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the iron is a catalyst for something else. Wait, another thought: when alkenes are treated with red-hot iron, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction. But that would require H2, which isn't present. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that when the dibromide (compound B) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it forms a different product. Let me think again about the structure. If compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3?), no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, and adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3, which is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. So, the possible products are 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is symmetric, so elimination would give the same product regardless of which side the hydrogen is abstracted from. So compound C would be propene again.

Then, passing C (propene) through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, another possibility: perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation, but propene doesn't have any halides. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is a catalyst for some kind of cracking. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Hmm, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps.

Wait, maybe compound B isn't 1,2-dibromopropane. Let me think: when propene reacts with Br2, it's a dibromide addition. But wait, maybe in this case, the addition is a vicinal dihalide, which is 1,2-dibromopropane. So, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an alkene. But the structure would depend on where the elimination occurs. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a different alkene. For instance, if the starting material is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, elimination could form either CH2=CHCH3 (propene) or CH3CHBr=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because elimination removes the Brs. Wait, perhaps the product is 1,3-butadiene? No, that's not possible because we're dealing with propane derivatives.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it out mentally. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding CH2=CHCH3 again. So compound C is propene.

Then, what happens when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube? I'm a bit stuck here. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of hydrogenation, but without H2, that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about the reaction conditions. Maybe the iron is a reducing agent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should move forward and see what the subsequent reactions are. Let's say compound D is formed. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids—could that be H2SO4 and H2SO3 (sulfuric and sulfurous acid)? Or maybe HNO3 and H2SO4, but not sure. Alternatively, it could be a mixture like H2SO4 and HCl, but perhaps it's a nitrating mixture. But wait, in some reactions, like the preparation of nitration, a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 is used.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structure of D. If C is propene, and we pass it through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it undergoes some kind of addition or reaction to form another compound. Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a ring formation. Wait, another thought: if propene is passed through a red-hot iron, maybe it's undergoing a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial reaction produces a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the bromination isn't adding Br2 but is a substitution. Wait, no—bromination in CCl4 usually refers to addition across double bonds, not substitution. So I think the initial steps are correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong product for the elimination step. Let me think again: 1,2-dibromopropane treated with alcoholic KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules and form an alkene. The possible alkenes are 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) and 2-propene (CH3CH=CH2), but wait, that's the same as propene since propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, no, CH3CH=CH2 is 1-propene, but that's actually the same as propene. So perhaps the product is propene.

So back to step 4: propene passed through red-hot iron. Maybe that's a hydrogenation catalyst? But without H2, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the propene is being dehydrohalogenated again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing some kind of isomerization, but propene is already an alkene.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something in the reaction conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the product after elimination isn't propene but another alkene. Wait, perhaps the initial dibromide is actually 1,2-dibromopropane, and upon elimination, it forms another structure. Wait, perhaps the elimination forms cyclopropane? No, that would require a different mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces something else. Wait, maybe the red-hot iron is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but the compound is already an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here and need to think differently.

Let's move forward. Suppose compound D is something else. Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Looking at the options, perhaps D is propane. Then, reaction with two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and HCl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if D is propane, reacting with strong acids might not do much. But perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps when propene is passed through a hot iron tube, it's being converted into something like propyne? That is, an alkyne. How? Perhaps through a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require HX. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is acting as a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation, but without HX, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction isn't propene. Maybe A is cyclopropane. Let me check: cyclopropane (C3H6) would react with bromine in CCl4. But cyclopropane is strained and can undergo bromination, but I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe it's a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that's with dienes.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it another way.

Let me map out each step with possible compounds:

A: C3H6 → likely propene (CH2=CHCH3)
B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, as propene has a double bond between C1 and C2, so adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.
C: B + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene again (CH2=CHCH3)
D: C (propene) passed through red-hot iron → suppose it's something else, like perhaps propyne (CH≡CCH3) via dehydrohalogenation, but without HX, that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's being hydrogenated. But without H2, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a ring formation. For example, propene could cyclize into cyclopropane. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound D is propane (C3H8). How would that happen? If propene is treated with a reducing agent. But without H2, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction with the red-hot iron is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is incorrect. Let me think again. What if A is not propene but cyclopropane?

If A is cyclopropane (C3H6), then bromination in CCl4 might lead to a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, cyclopropane could add bromine across a ring. But I'm not certain about that product. Alternatively, perhaps the bromination would lead to a bromocyclopropane. Then, treatment with alcoholic KOH might cause an elimination, perhaps opening the ring. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the possibility that A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and C is propene again. Then, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's being converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration to form something else, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which statements might be incorrect.

Option D says that C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas, then yes, it's flammable. So option D would be correct, so the incorrect statement would be elsewhere.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride test is for phenol groups. So H would have a phenol group if this is true.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. That would mean D has two sets of equivalent protons. If D is propane, its NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. Alternatively, if D is something else, perhaps with two sets of equivalent protons, like maybe a di-substituted alkene.

Option A says F is used for the synthesis of dyes. F would be something like benzene or another aromatic compound. If F is benzene, that's used in dye synthesis.

Wait, but let's try to think step by step again, perhaps I missed a key reaction.

Let's re-examine the steps:

1. A (C3H6) → bromination → B (dibromide)
2. B → alcoholic KOH → C (propene)
3. C → red-hot iron → D
4. D → two strong acids → E
5. E → iron scrap and HCl → F
6. F → nitrous acid → G
7. G → NaOH → H

If I can't figure out D, maybe I should think about the subsequent steps.

Suppose D is propane (C3H8). Then, reacting with two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and H2SO3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and E is something else.

Alternatively, if D is propane and reacted with H2SO4 and another acid, perhaps it's a sulfonation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propene. Then, reacting with strong acids might not do much, unless it's a nitrating mixture, but propene isn't typically nitrated under such conditions.

Wait, maybe I should think about each step's possible products and see if any of the options are incorrect.

Another approach: let's think about each product.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas, that's correct. So option D is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. That suggests H has a phenol group. So when G reacts with NaOH to form H, perhaps H is phenol?

Wait, let's think about G. G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, which can undergo various reactions. Alternatively, if F is an aromatic amine, reacting with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt, which could decompose to form a phenol under certain conditions.

Wait, but let's think about F. F is formed when E reacts with iron scrap and HCl. That's a typical condition for the reduction of a nitro compound to an amine. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

So, E → F: nitro → amine.

G is formed when F (amine) reacts with nitrous acid. That would form a diazonium salt, which could then decompose, perhaps in the presence of water to form a phenol (H).

So H would be phenol, which would give a yellow color with ferric chloride (option B is correct).

So option B is correct, so the incorrect statement can't be B.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is an aromatic amine, like aniline, which is used in dye synthesis, then A is correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. Let's imagine D's structure. If D is propane (CH3CH2CH3), the NMR would show a single singlet for the six equivalent H's on the CH3 groups. So that's only one singlet, not two. So option C would be incorrect. Alternatively, if D is something else, like maybe 1-propanol, the NMR would have different signals.

Wait, if D is propane, then 1H NMR would show a singlet. So option C says two singlets, which would be incorrect. So option C could be the incorrect statement. Alternatively, if D is another compound, like maybe 1,2-dibromopropane, but that doesn't fit with the steps. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is propene. Propene's NMR would have two sets of protons: the two CH2 groups and the CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The protons on the CH2= would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH. The CH3 would be a triplet as well. So the NMR would show a triplet and a triplet, but maybe as two singlets if there's some symmetry, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back and re-examine the step where C is passed through a red-hot iron tube.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction with red-hot iron is a dehydrohalogenation, but C is propene, which doesn't have any halogens. So perhaps D is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial steps. Let's think again about compound B and C.

If A is propene, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Then C is propene again after elimination. Then, perhaps when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a reaction to form something else. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of cracking, but without H2, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the red-hot iron is causing a decomposition reaction, like breaking the propene into smaller molecules. But that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the red-hot iron is causing the propene to form acetylene (propyne). How? Propyne is HC≡C-CH3. To form that from propene, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation with a strong base, but without HX, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrogenation, but without H2O or another oxidizing agent, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that D is something else, like maybe cyclopropane. But how?

Another approach: Perhaps the first reaction isn't adding Br2 but substituting. But no, bromination in CCl4 is typically addition for alkenes.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is not propene but another C3H6 isomer.

Wait, C3H6 can also be cyclopropane. So let's consider that possibility.

If A is cyclopropane (C3H6), then bromination in CCl4 might add Br across a ring, perhaps forming bromocyclopropane. Then, treating with alcoholic KOH could cause elimination, perhaps opening the ring. But I'm not sure about the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination would substitute a hydrogen with Br, but that's less likely in CCl4.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step, even if I'm not entirely confident.

Let me try to outline the reaction steps with possible compounds:

1. A: C3H6 → propene (CH2=CHCH3)
2. Bromination → 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)
3. Alcoholic KOH → elimination to form propene (CH2=CHCH3) → Compound C is propene.
4. Propene passed through red-hot iron → D. What could D be? Maybe propane (CH3CH2CH3) via some reduction or hydrogenation, but without H2, perhaps another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), but I'm not sure how that forms.

Wait, maybe the red-hot iron is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but propene doesn't have any halogens. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalyst for a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe the iron is causing the propene to decompose into something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that D is propane. Then, when D (propane) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's undergoing sulfonation or some other reaction. But I'm not sure.

But let's proceed. Suppose D is propane.

5. D → reacts with two strong acids → E. If the two acids are H2SO4 and H2SO3, perhaps E is something like propanesulfonic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and E is something else. But this is getting too vague.

Another approach: let's think about the final steps.

6. E → reacts with Fe and HCl → F. Fe and HCl are conditions for the reduction of nitro compounds to amines. So if E is a nitro compound, F would be the corresponding amine.

7. F → reacts with nitrous acid → G. That would form a diazonium salt, which can undergo various reactions, like decomposition to form a phenol or coupling reactions.

8. G → NaOH → H. If H is phenol, then it would give a yellow color with ferric chloride (option B correct).

So, F would be an aromatic amine. Thus, E would be a nitro compound.

So, to have E as a nitro compound, what must D be?

If D is propene, reacting with two strong acids might not form a nitro compound. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key step. Let me think: if D is benzene, then reacting with a mixture of strong acids (like HNO3 and H2SO4) would nitrate it, forming nitrobenzene (E). Then, E (nitrobenzene) would be reduced with Fe and HCl to form aniline (F). Then, F (aniline) reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium chloride (G), which upon treatment with NaOH would form phenol (H), which gives a positive test with ferric chloride.

But wait, how would D be benzene? Let's see the steps leading to D.

If C is propene, and D is benzene, that implies a major structural change. Perhaps D is formed via a series of reactions that I'm not considering.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, which then undergoes some reaction to form benzene, but that's unlikely without a lot of steps.

Hmm, perhaps the earlier steps are leading towards benzene. Let's re-examine.

If A is propene:

- Bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane.
- Alcoholic KOH gives propene again.
- Passing through red-hot iron → perhaps some kind of cyclization or hydrogenation. Wait, if propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's being dehydrohalogenated to form something else, but earlier steps don't have any halogens. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is causing a cracking reaction, but without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options again.

Option C says D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propane, the NMR would show a singlet for the six equivalent H's. So option C would be incorrect because it's only one singlet, not two. So the incorrect statement would be option C.

But wait, what if D is something else, like maybe 1,2-dibromopropane again? No, because C is propene, and D is after passing through iron.

Alternatively, if D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), its NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 group and a different signal for the triple bond protons. But propyne's structure is HC≡C-CH3, so the CH3 would be a singlet, and the HC≡C would have another set of protons. Wait, no, the triple bond protons are only on the terminal carbon, so they would be split based on neighboring groups. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is 1-bromopropane. Then, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2Br and a triplet for the CH2CH3, but that's not two singlets.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming D is propane. Let me think again.

If D is cyclopropane, its NMR would have a singlet for all six equivalent H's, so only one singlet. So option C (two singlets) would be incorrect.

But how could D be cyclopropane? Let me think about the steps. If C is propene, and then it's passed through red-hot iron, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-closing reaction to form cyclopropane. That would make sense if the iron is acting as a catalyst for such a reaction.

So, if D is cyclopropane, then its NMR would have a singlet, making option C incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the incorrect statement is option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. Because if D is cyclopropane, it would give a single singlet, not two.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A, identified as propene (C3H6), based on its molecular formula and the context of bromination in carbon tetrachloride, which typically targets alkenes. Bromination of propene adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of two HBr molecules, regenerating propene (Compound C). 

When Compound C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a reaction to form Compound D. Based on the conditions, this step likely involves a cyclization reaction, forming cyclopropane (C3H6). Cyclopropane is a strained ring structure with all hydrogens equivalent, resulting in a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Compound D (cyclopropane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, potentially forming a nitro compound (Compound E). Subsequent reduction of E with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid produces aniline (Compound F), an aromatic amine. Reaction of F with nitrous acid forms a diazonium salt (Compound G), which reacts with sodium hydroxide to yield phenol (Compound H). Phenol reacts positively with ferric chloride, giving a yellow color.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F (aniline) is indeed used for the synthesis of dyes. This is correct.
- **Option B**: H (phenol) gives a yellow color with ferric chloride, which is consistent with the reaction. This is correct.
- **Option C**: D (cyclopropane) has all six hydrogens equivalent, resulting in a single singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. The statement that D gives two singlets is incorrect.
- **Option D**: C (propene) is a flammable gas, which is correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as cyclopropane does not give two singlets in the 1H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C
