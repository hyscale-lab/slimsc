Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He's using vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is super low. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible to improve the electron microscopy because fewer gas molecules mean less electron scattering, right?

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles remain, and the mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment would affect this. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting about the mean free path. It changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment is the same as before, so that shouldn't be the reason for the change. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 relative to λ1.

Hmm, the mean free path formula is something I remember. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n * π * d²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, P is pressure, and d is the diameter. Or wait, maybe another version relates λ to pressure and temperature more directly.

Wait, another formula I've seen is the mean free path λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as λ = (1.33 * 10^6) * (T/P), where T is in Kelvin and P is in Torr. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up different expressions. Let's get the exact formula right.

I think the correct expression for the mean free path in a gas is λ = 1/(n * σ * v_avg), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section, and v_avg is the average molecular speed. Alternatively, another approach is that the mean free path can be expressed using the ideal gas law. Since n = P/(k*T), where P is pressure, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. So substituting that into the mean free path formula, λ = 1/( (P/(kT)) * π d² ) * something. Let me think.

Wait, I think the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). So if pressure changes, λ changes. But in this scenario, the pressure is the same. Wait, but no—the initial pressure is the same when he measured λ1. But when he starts the electron beam, maybe the pressure changes.

Wait, no, the question says that the vacuum pumps have already created the ultra-high vacuum. The pressure is still under 1e-9 Torr, so the same as before. But when Mike starts the electron beam, does that affect the gas pressure?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing some kind of heating or ionization of the gas molecules. Or maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Oh, because when the electron beam is on, the electrons interact with the gas molecules more. So the cross-section for scattering might increase.

Wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the gas's properties. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. So the gas molecules might scatter the electrons, but does that affect the gas molecules' own mean free path among themselves?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The initial mean free path λ1 is calculated without the electron beam on, just from the gas properties. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules might be involved in more interactions with the electrons, but how does that affect their own mean free path?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas pressure or temperature (since the temperature remains the same). So the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other should stay the same. But the question says the mean free path changed to λ2. So why would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which might cause them to move or change in a way that affects their number density. Or more likely, perhaps the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be ionized or removed, thus effectively reducing the number density n.

Wait, but Mike detected the gas particles with a mass spectrometer before and after. If the electron beam is causing the gas to leave, perhaps the pressure drops, which would increase the mean free path. But the problem says the temperature remained the same, but if the pressure changes, that affects n and thus λ.

Wait, the problem says that the mean free path changes to λ2 upon initiating the electron beam. So, why would λ change? Because the number density n might have changed. If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be removed (e.g., through sputtering or other mechanisms), then n would decrease, leading to an increase in λ, since λ is inversely proportional to n (from the formula λ = 1/(n σ v)).

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the pressure but affects the effective cross-section. Because when the electron beam is on, each gas molecule has a higher chance of scattering electrons, which might effectively change the cross-section for collisions. Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules (gas molecule to gas molecule) is what's being discussed. The electron beam might not affect that, unless the beam is causing the gas to heat up, but the problem states the temperature is the same.

Wait, maybe the key point is that when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules more. But the mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the gas's own collisions. So if the electron beam is causing more electron-molecule interactions, perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or even removed, leading to a lower pressure (lower n) and thus a longer mean free path (λ increases).

But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So if the pressure is the same, then λ wouldn't change. But if the electron beam causes some gas to be removed, then pressure would drop, increasing λ.

Wait, but the problem says Mike accurately determined the mean free path when the beam wasn't on, which is λ1. When the beam is on, he finds a different λ2. So why is λ2 different? If the pressure is the same, but maybe the effective cross-section for gas-molecule collisions has changed. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing a change in the effective number of collisions, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the electrons are providing an additional force on the gas molecules, which might cause them to move more, thereby increasing the number density in a certain region, but that doesn't directly fit with the mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, effectively changing their size or cross-section, which would alter the collision frequency. For example, if a gas molecule becomes ionized, it might have a different effective diameter, thus changing σ in the mean free path formula.

Wait, but if ionization occurs, the number of neutral gas molecules would decrease, which would lower n, thus increasing λ. So if λ2 is larger than λ1, then λ2 > λ1.

But the problem says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path is now λ2. The question is whether λ2 is greater than, less than, or equal to λ1.

Wait, let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, which would mean Mike's observation is wrong.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

But the question is about why λ2 would differ from λ1.

Wait, λ is the mean free path in the gas. Mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and proportional to temperature. So if the pressure goes down, λ increases.

If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to leave the compartment, the pressure would decrease. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the opposite. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D is a range between λ1 and 1.22*λ1.

But why 1.22? Wait, 1.22 comes from the factor in the mean free path formula. Let me think.

Wait, the mean free path formula can also be written as λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules. Another way to write it is λ = (1.33 * 10^6 Å) * (T [K])/(P [Torr]).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the 1.22 factor.

Alternatively, the factor comes from the equation when using the collision integral or something else. Maybe when considering the scattering of electrons, the effective cross-section is different. For example, when considering electron scattering, the cross-section might be larger than the physical cross-section of the gas molecule. So perhaps the effective σ increases, leading to a lower λ.

Wait, but wait—when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules. So the electrons would have a much higher chance of scattering the gas molecules. But how does this affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Wait, maybe the mean free path is calculated for the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. So if the electron beam is on, the gas molecules would be subject to more collisions with electrons, but that doesn't affect their own collisions. Unless the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move in such a way that the effective number of collisions among themselves changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to a change in the effective pressure or number density. For example, if the electron beam's energy is causing gas molecules to be expelled, leading to lower n and hence higher λ.

But in the problem, Mike accurately determined λ1 before the beam was on. Then, when the beam is on, he observes λ2. So the change in λ must be due to a change in the conditions affecting the gas molecules.

Wait, the problem says that the mean free path is determined based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So λ1 is calculated based on these parameters. But when the beam is on, perhaps the pressure in the compartment increases because the electron beam is heating the sample, which might cause some gas to be released. Wait, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Another angle: Electron scattering with gas molecules. When the beam is on, electrons are hitting the gas molecules. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, it imparts some energy, perhaps causing the gas molecule to move. But if the gas molecules are moving more, does that affect their average speed v? Wait, but the temperature is the same, so average speed should be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes a change in the effective cross-section for gas-gas collisions. But I'm not quite sure about that.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, their effective cross-section might change. Suppose a molecule becomes ionized; it might have a larger effective cross-section because the ion has a different charge and perhaps a larger radius. So if σ increases, then λ = 1/(n σ v) would decrease, leading to λ2 < λ1. So in that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

But wait, if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls of the compartment, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. That would lower n, increasing λ, so λ2>λ1.

Wait, but the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature is the same. So if the pressure hasn't changed, then λ remains the same. Therefore, the only way λ changes is if the pressure has changed. So if the electron beam somehow causes the pressure to drop (n decreases), then λ2 would increase.

But why would the pressure drop? The vacuum pumps are already running, and the sample compartment is under ultra-high vacuum. Perhaps the electron beam heats the sample, causing gas molecules to be released from the sample. But the problem says the temperature of the compartment is the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be sputtered out of the compartment. So n decreases, leading to λ increasing. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Given that, among the options, option A is λ2 >=1.22 * λ1, which suggests a significant increase. Option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the case if n increases. But why would n increase when the beam is on? That's unclear.

Wait, wait. Let's think about another angle. The mean free path is also related to the probability of electron scattering. When Mike turns on the electron beam, he's using a high-energy electron beam (1000 kV is 1e6 eV, which is very high). These electrons are likely to interact more strongly with the gas molecules, perhaps increasing the scattering events, but how does that affect the gas's own mean free path?

Wait, maybe the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's pressure but affects the effective cross-section for electron-gas interactions. But the mean free path for gas molecules among themselves is based on their own collisions, not with the electrons.

So perhaps the mean free path λ remains the same, leading to option B. But the question says that Mike found λ2, which is different.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile, perhaps moving more quickly, which would increase their average speed v. Since λ is proportional to v, that would increase λ.

But wait, the temperature is the same, so the average speed shouldn't change. The average speed depends on temperature. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's approach it from the physics of electron microscopes. In a TEM, the electron beam can cause various effects like electron scattering, heating, and ionization of the sample and any gas present.

When Mike turns on the electron beam, the gas molecules in the compartment are now being bombarded with electrons. This could cause two main effects: 1) the gas molecules could be ionized, and 2) the electrons could impart momentum to the gas molecules, possibly increasing their speed.

If the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and might be repelled by the electron beam's electric field or the charged plates in the microscope. This could cause the ions to be expelled from the compartment, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules (lower n), which would increase the mean free path.

Alternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter might increase (if they expand upon ionization), which would increase the collision cross-section σ, leading to a decrease in λ. But if n decreases more significantly than σ increases, λ would increase.

But I'm not sure about the relative effects. Let's consider another approach: the mean free path without the electron beam is λ1. With the beam on, if gas molecules are being removed, n decreases, so λ increases. Thus, λ2 > λ1.

Now, looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So if λ2 is larger, the options are A or D. But why would λ2 be exactly 1.22 times λ1?

Wait, 1.22 comes into play when considering the Debye length or something else? Or perhaps it's a factor from the mean free path formula when considering electron scattering. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the mean free path in a different context, like electron mean free path versus gas molecule mean free path.

Wait another thought: The mean free path of the electrons in the presence of the gas would be different than the mean free path of the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, not the electrons'. So when Mike is measuring the mean free path based on electron scattering, perhaps he is indirectly measuring the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the electrons are more likely to be scattered, so the effective mean free path for the electrons (which is different from the gas's) would be shorter. But the question is about the gas's mean free path, so that might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas's mean free path is being measured via the electron's scattering events. So if the electrons are more scattered, the observed mean free path for the electrons is different. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the gas properties without considering the electron beam. When the beam is on, the presence of the electrons could cause the gas molecules to have a different mean free path because of electron-induced effects.

Wait, if the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more, perhaps the effective pressure increases. But why would that happen? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think of it another way. What is the effect of the electron beam on the gas? The electron beam brings a high flux of electrons, which can cause several effects:

1. Gas ionization: electrons collide with gas atoms, causing ionization. Ions are then accelerated or repelled by the electric fields in the microscope, possibly leaving the compartment. This would reduce n, increasing λ.

2. Heating: the energy deposited by the electron beam could heat the gas, which would increase the average speed v of the gas molecules, leading to a longer mean free path. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so this effect is nullified.

3. Coulomb forces: if the gas is ionized, the resulting ions could interact with each other or with the beam, affecting their distribution. But again, this might lead to a lower n.

So, if the electron beam causes ionization and the ions are expelled, n decreases, leading to a longer mean free path λ2. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, options A and D suggest λ2 is larger than λ1. So which one?

The question is, can we conclude anything specific about the factor? The options don't give a specific factor except option A, which says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. So why 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2/ (pi)) or something. Let me think: the formula for the mean free path is λ = 1/(n * π d²), where d is the effective diameter. Alternatively, for a more precise calculation, the collision integral and other factors are considered. But I'm not recalling the exact origin of the 1.22 factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor comes from the relation between the mean free path and the Debye length or something else. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of the electron beam, the effective cross-section increases by a factor of 1.22, but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: considering the mean free path for electron scattering. The electron's mean free path is different from the gas molecule's mean free path. But if Mike is using the electron scattering to infer the gas's mean free path, perhaps the two are inversely related.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in a way that the gas's mean free path becomes shorter. Because the electrons are providing more collisions, but that's for the electrons, not the gas. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are influencing the gas molecules, causing them to have more frequent collisions, thereby reducing λ.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was calculated from the gas's own properties. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to lose some energy, perhaps moving more quickly, but that's not directly affecting the collision rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence increases the number of collisions the gas molecules have with the beam's components, but I'm not sure how that affects their mutual collisions.

Another angle: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be in a different state, perhaps more ionized, leading to a change in the collision cross-section. For example, if the gas molecules are ionized, their diameter effectively increases, leading to a larger σ. So σ increases, which would decrease λ: λ = 1/(n σ), so if σ increases without n changing, λ decreases.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed, n decreases, which would increase λ. So which effect dominates?

If the gas is ionized and expelled, n decreases, λ increases. If σ increases due to ionization, λ decreases. So which effect is more significant?

I'm not certain, but perhaps in an ultra-high vacuum, the effects of ionization and removal are more significant than the change in σ. So n decreases, λ increases. Thus, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But if that's the case, then looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path without the electron beam (λ1) is calculated using the formula based on the ideal gas law and the collision cross-section. When the electron beam is on, the gas is subjected to a higher electric field, causing the ions to drift, possibly leading to a lower effective pressure. Alternatively, the gas ions are attracted to the electron beam, leading to a lower density in the region the electron beam passes through.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a change in the ionization state of the gas, which affects the collision cross-section. For example, if the gas molecules are singly ionized, their effective diameter increases, which would decrease λ. But if they're being expelled, n drops, which increases λ.

But without knowing which effect is dominant, it's hard to say. However, the problem states that the temperature didn't change. So the only way λ changes is if n changes or σ changes.

If the gas is being ionized and expelled, n decreases. So λ increases, λ2 > λ1.

But the question is, what can we conclude? The options suggest that λ2 could be larger or smaller.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path of the gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. Wait, no, the formula is λ ∝ T / (P * d²). So if pressure drops, λ increases.

If the electron beam causes a drop in pressure (n decreases), λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, the options would suggest that λ2 is larger than λ1. Among the options, A and D suggest λ2 >= lambda1, but A is a lower bound, and D is a range.

But the problem states that Mike used the vacuum pumps and the pressure is <1e-9 Torr. When the beam is on, the pressure might be even lower, perhaps. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct answer would be option A or C, but based on reasoning, λ2 is larger. So options A or D.

But the problem says "mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same." So the change must be due to a change in n or σ.

But the problem doesn't give any information about the pressure changing. It just says that when the beam was off, the pressure was less than 1e-9 Torr. When the beam is on, the pressure might change slightly, but I'm not told if it's higher or lower.

Wait, another way to think: When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized. Once ionized, they might be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope and leave the compartment. This would decrease n, leading to a longer mean free path.

If n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

So among the options, A says lambda2 >= 1.22 * lambda1. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps there's a standard factor that comes into play here. For example, when considering electron scattering in a gas, the mean free path of the electrons is often given by λ_e = 1.22 * (P in Torr / T in K)^{-1} * 1e6 Å. But that's for electron mean free path.

Wait, but the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons'. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor is from the formula for the mean free path when considering both translational and rotational collisions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas's mean free path might be affected by the increased number of collisions with the electrons, but that's for the gas's cross-section. If the electrons are providing more collisions for the gas molecules, perhaps the effective number of collisions increases. But wait, the mean free path λ is the average distance between collisions among the gas molecules. If the gas molecules are colliding more with electrons, that doesn't affect their collisional mean free path among themselves. So λ for gas-gas collisions should remain the same. Hence, λ2 would be equal to λ1. But the problem says that λ2 is different, so that line of reasoning must be incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that when the electron beam is on, the gas's cross-section for electron scattering is much larger, leading to more scattering events, which the gas molecules experience as additional collisions. But this is for the gas's interaction with the electrons, not with other gas molecules. So it doesn't affect the gas's own mean free path.

Thus, perhaps there's no change in λ. So Mike's observation might be incorrect, which would suggest option B.

But the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1. So perhaps his determination of λ2 is correct, implying that the mean free path has changed. Thus, the mean free path must have changed due to some effect.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be moving faster due to the energy transfer from the electrons. But the problem says the temperature is the same, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become excited, leading to a higher effective cross-section for collisions. So σ increases, leading to a lower λ. Hence, λ2 < λ1.

In that case, option C would be correct.

But why would the cross-section increase? If the gas molecules are in a higher energy state (e.g., vibrationally excited), their effective diameter for collisions might increase, making σ larger. So λ would decrease, leading to λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure if that's a significant effect. Alternatively, ionization could cause an increase in σ.

So, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-section could be larger. So the mean free path would decrease. Thus, λ2 < λ1.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But wait, another point: if the gas is ionized, the number density of neutral molecules decreases. So n decreases. So λ would increase. But if the cross-section σ increases, the effect on λ depends on which effect is more dominant.

If n decreases by a factor x and σ increases by a factor y, then λ would change by (x/y). So whether λ increases or decreases depends on whether x > y.

But without knowing the values of x and y, it's hard to say. So perhaps the dominant effect is the change in n. If n decreases because gas is being expelled, then λ increases.

So, going back, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 > λ1, so λ2 is greater than λ1.

But the options don't have just a simple λ2> λ1. The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 * λ1

B) λ2 = λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 * λ1

So if λ2 is larger than λ1, the possibilities are A or D.

But the question is, why the factor 1.22? 1.22 is approximately 4/π, which is about 1.27, so close to that. Alternatively, it might be related to the geometry of the collision, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is calculated as λ = L * sqrt(P/(T)) ), but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, the formula for mean free path in a gas is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter.

If the electron beam is causing the gas to ionize, perhaps the effective diameter d increases. So d increases, which would decrease λ. But if the pressure P decreases (because gas is being expelled), then λ would increase. So the net effect depends on which change is more significant.

But without knowing whether d increases more or P decreases more, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's own mean free path. Therefore, λ2 should be equal to λ1, as in option B. But the problem states that Mike found λ2 was different. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be in a different state, such as a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path could be different because the interactions are dominated by electromagnetic forces rather than collisions. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to a change in the effective pressure measured. For example, if the beam is causing the gas to expand, the effective pressure might decrease, leading to a longer mean free path.

But I'm not getting anywhere definitive. Let's try to think of the options again. The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 * λ1

B) λ2 = λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 * λ1

Based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas to be expelled, thus reducing n, which increases λ. So λ2 > λ1. So the only options that fit are A and D.

But what's the factor 1.22? Maybe it's a standard factor in electron microscopy for the mean free path when the beam is on. Alternatively, perhaps when considering electron scattering, the mean free path is 1.22 times longer than the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, the confusion arises because when the electron beam is on, the effective cross-section for electron scattering is higher, but that's for the electrons, not the gas.

Wait, perhaps the initial mean free path λ1 is for the gas molecules, and the observed λ2 is for the electrons. But the question says Mike observed the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So it's the gas's mean free path as deduced from the electron scattering.

In that case, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas's effective cross-section to increase. So σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if the gas is being expelled, n decreases, leading to a longer λ. So which effect is more significant?

If the pressure is unchanged, but the effective cross-section increases due to ionization, then λ decreases. But if the pressure drops, λ increases. So it's a trade-off between n and σ.

But without more information, perhaps we can only conclude that λ2 is not equal to λ1, meaning that the correct answer is either A, C, or D.

But the problem says that the temperature remains the same. So any change in λ must come from a change in n or σ.

If the beam causes gas to be expelled, n decreases, λ increases. So λ2> λ1.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the gas to ionize, increasing σ, λ decreases.

But in an ultra-high vacuum, the dominant effect is likely to be the change in gas density, not the cross-section.

Therefore, λ2> λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But the question is whether λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1 (option A) or somewhere in between (option D).

But without knowing the exact change, perhaps the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The mean free path is based on the gas's own collisions. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons. But the mean free path among the gas molecules is determined by their mutual collisions. So the presence of the electron beam shouldn't affect the mutual collisions, so λ should remain the same.

But the problem says that Mike found λ2 different. So perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is less than or greater than λ1, but which?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be heated, which would increase the average speed. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so that can't be.

Another possibility: perhaps the electron beam's magnetic field or electric field affects the gas molecules' movement, causing them to have a longer mean free path. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas to be expelled, leading to a lower n and thus a longer mean free path, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why 1.22? Maybe because the effective cross-section for electron-gas interactions is higher, which the mean free path is calculated based on that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor 1.22 is part of the formula for the mean free path when considering electron scattering. For example, the mean free path for electrons in a gas is given by λ_e = 1.22 * (P / T)^(-1/2) * 1e6 Å. But that's for electrons, not the gas.

In any case, the options don't give a specific factor except A and D. Without more information, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path actually decreases because the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, but that's for the electrons.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure experienced by the gas molecules, causing their mean free path to be shorter. But that's unclear.

In the end, I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1, because the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more ionized, increasing their cross-section and thus reducing the mean free path. But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber when an electron beam is turned on. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \cdot \sigma \cdot v_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section, and \(v_{\text{avg}}\) is the average molecular speed. For an ideal gas, \(n = \frac{P}{kT}\), where \(P\) is pressure, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is temperature.

2. **Effect of Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam can cause ionization of gas molecules, increasing the effective collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)) due to changes in molecular size or charge.
   - Ionization may also lead to gas molecules being expelled from the compartment, reducing the number density (\(n\)).

3. **Pressure and Temperature**:
   - The problem states that the temperature remains constant, so \(v_{\text{avg}}\) does not change.
   - If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be expelled, \(n\) decreases, leading to an increase in \(\lambda\). Conversely, if ionization increases \(\sigma\), \(\lambda\) decreases.

4. **Trade-offs**:
   - A decrease in \(n\) (due to gas expulsion) increases \(\lambda\).
   - An increase in \(\sigma\) (due to ionization) decreases \(\lambda\).
   - The net effect depends on whether the reduction in \(n\) dominates over the increase in \(\sigma\).

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a significant increase in \(\lambda\). This would occur if gas expulsion dominates, leading to a substantial reduction in \(n\).
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: Implies no change in \(\lambda\), which contradicts the problem statement that \(\lambda_2\) is different.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a decrease in \(\lambda\), which would occur if ionization increases \(\sigma\) more significantly than \(n\) decreases.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a moderate increase in \(\lambda\), indicating a partial reduction in \(n\) without reaching the full factor of 1.22.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The dominant effect is likely the increase in \(\sigma\) due to ionization, leading to a decrease in \(\lambda\). This aligns with **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He's using vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is super low. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible to improve the electron microscopy because fewer gas molecules mean less electron scattering, right?

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles remain, and the mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Factors like the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment would affect this. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting about the mean free path. It changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment is the same as before, so that shouldn't be the reason for the change. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 relative to λ1.

Hmm, the mean free path formula is something I remember. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(n * π * d²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and d is the effective diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, P is pressure, and d is the diameter. Or wait, maybe another version relates λ to pressure and temperature more directly.

Wait, another formula I've seen is the mean free path λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where P is the pressure. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as λ = (1.33 * 10^6) * (T/P), where T is in Kelvin and P is in Torr. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up different expressions. Let's get the exact formula right.

I think the correct expression for the mean free path in a gas is λ = 1/(n * σ * v_avg), where n is the number density, σ is the collision cross-section, and v_avg is the average molecular speed. Alternatively, another approach is that the mean free path can be expressed using the ideal gas law. Since n = P/(k*T), where P is pressure, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. So substituting that into the mean free path formula, λ = 1/( (P/(kT)) * π d² ) * something. Let me think.

Wait, I think the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). So if pressure changes, λ changes. But in this scenario, the pressure is the same. Wait, but no—the initial pressure is the same when he measured λ1. But when he starts the electron beam, maybe the pressure changes.

Wait, no, the question says that the vacuum pumps have already created the ultra-high vacuum. The pressure is still under 1e-9 Torr, so the same as before. But when Mike starts the electron beam, does that affect the gas pressure?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing some kind of heating or ionization of the gas molecules. Or maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Oh, because when the electron beam is on, the electrons interact with the gas molecules more. So the cross-section for scattering might increase.

Wait, the mean free path is calculated based on the gas's properties. So when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. So the gas molecules might scatter the electrons, but does that affect the gas molecules' own mean free path among themselves?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The initial mean free path λ1 is calculated without the electron beam on, just from the gas properties. When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules might be involved in more interactions with the electrons, but how does that affect their own mean free path?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas pressure or temperature (since the temperature remains the same). So the mean free path for the gas molecules colliding with each other should stay the same. But the question says the mean free path changed to λ2. So why would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which might cause them to move or change in a way that affects their number density. Or more likely, perhaps the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be ionized or removed, thus effectively reducing the number density n.

Wait, but Mike detected the gas particles with a mass spectrometer before and after. If the electron beam is causing the gas to leave, perhaps the pressure drops, which would increase the mean free path. But the problem says the temperature remained the same, but if the pressure changes, that affects n and thus λ.

Wait, the problem says that the mean free path changes to λ2 upon initiating the electron beam. So, why would λ change? Because the number density n might have changed. If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be removed (e.g., through sputtering or other mechanisms), then n would decrease, leading to an increase in λ, since λ is inversely proportional to n (from the formula λ = 1/(n σ v)).

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the pressure but affects the effective cross-section. Because when the electron beam is on, each gas molecule has a higher chance of scattering electrons, which might effectively change the cross-section for collisions. Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules (gas molecule to gas molecule) is what's being discussed. The electron beam might not affect that, unless the beam is causing the gas to heat up, but the problem states the temperature is the same.

Wait, maybe the key point is that when the electron beam is on, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules more. But the mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the gas's own collisions. So if the electron beam is causing more electron-molecule interactions, perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or even removed, leading to a lower pressure (lower n) and thus a longer mean free path (λ increases).

But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same. So if the pressure is the same, then λ wouldn't change. But if the electron beam causes some gas to be removed, then pressure would drop, increasing λ.

Wait, but the problem says Mike accurately determined the mean free path when the beam wasn't on, which is λ1. When the beam is on, he finds a different λ2. So why is λ2 different? If the pressure is the same, but maybe the effective cross-section for gas-molecule collisions has changed. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing a change in the effective number of collisions, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the electrons are providing an additional force on the gas molecules, which might cause them to move more, thereby increasing the number density in a certain region, but that doesn't directly fit with the mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, effectively changing their size or cross-section, which would alter the collision frequency. For example, if a gas molecule becomes ionized, it might have a different effective diameter, thus changing σ in the mean free path formula.

Wait, but if ionization occurs, the number of neutral gas molecules would decrease, which would lower n, thus increasing λ. So if λ2 is larger than λ1, then λ2 > λ1.

But the problem says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path is now λ2. The question is whether λ2 is greater than, less than, or equal to λ1.

Wait, let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, which would mean Mike's observation is wrong.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

But the question is about why λ2 would differ from λ1.

Wait, λ is the mean free path in the gas. Mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and proportional to temperature. So if the pressure goes down, λ increases.

If the electron beam is causing gas molecules to leave the compartment, the pressure would decrease. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the opposite. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D is a range between λ1 and 1.22*λ1.

But why 1.22? Wait, 1.22 comes from the factor in the mean free path formula. Let me think.

Wait, the mean free path formula can also be written as λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules. Another way to write it is λ = (1.33 * 10^6 Å) * (T [K])/(P [Torr]).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the 1.22 factor.

Alternatively, the factor comes from the equation when using the collision integral or something else. Maybe when considering the scattering of electrons, the effective cross-section is different. For example, when considering electron scattering, the cross-section might be larger than the physical cross-section of the gas molecule. So perhaps the effective σ increases, leading to a lower λ.

Wait, but wait—when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules. So the electrons would have a much higher chance of scattering the gas molecules. But how does this affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Wait, maybe the mean free path is calculated for the gas molecules colliding with each other, not with the electrons. So if the electron beam is on, the gas molecules would be subject to more collisions with electrons, but that doesn't affect their own collisions. Unless the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to move in such a way that the effective number of collisions among themselves changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to a change in the effective pressure or number density. For example, if the electron beam's energy is causing gas molecules to be expelled, leading to lower n and hence higher λ.

But in the problem, Mike accurately determined λ1 before the beam was on. Then, when the beam is on, he observes λ2. So the change in λ must be due to a change in the conditions affecting the gas molecules.

Wait, the problem says that the mean free path is determined based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So λ1 is calculated based on these parameters. But when the beam is on, perhaps the pressure in the compartment increases because the electron beam is heating the sample, which might cause some gas to be released. Wait, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Another angle: Electron scattering with gas molecules. When the beam is on, electrons are hitting the gas molecules. Each time an electron scatters off a gas molecule, it imparts some energy, perhaps causing the gas molecule to move. But if the gas molecules are moving more, does that affect their average speed v? Wait, but the temperature is the same, so average speed should be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes a change in the effective cross-section for gas-gas collisions. But I'm not quite sure about that.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with other molecules. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, their effective cross-section might change. Suppose a molecule becomes ionized; it might have a larger effective cross-section because the ion has a different charge and perhaps a larger radius. So if σ increases, then λ = 1/(n σ v) would decrease, leading to λ2 < λ1. So in that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

But wait, if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls of the compartment, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. That would lower n, increasing λ, so λ2>λ1.

Wait, but the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature is the same. So if the pressure hasn't changed, then λ remains the same. Therefore, the only way λ changes is if the pressure has changed. So if the electron beam somehow causes the pressure to drop (n decreases), then λ2 would increase.

But why would the pressure drop? The vacuum pumps are already running, and the sample compartment is under ultra-high vacuum. Perhaps the electron beam heats the sample, causing gas molecules to be released from the sample. But the problem says the temperature of the compartment is the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be sputtered out of the compartment. So n decreases, leading to λ increasing. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Given that, among the options, option A is λ2 >=1.22 * λ1, which suggests a significant increase. Option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the case if n increases. But why would n increase when the beam is on? That's unclear.

Wait, wait. Let's think about another angle. The mean free path is also related to the probability of electron scattering. When Mike turns on the electron beam, he's using a high-energy electron beam (1000 kV is 1e6 eV, which is very high). These electrons are likely to interact more strongly with the gas molecules, perhaps increasing the scattering events, but how does that affect the gas's own mean free path?

Wait, maybe the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's pressure but affects the effective cross-section for electron-gas interactions. But the mean free path for gas molecules among themselves is based on their own collisions, not with the electrons.

So perhaps the mean free path λ remains the same, leading to option B. But the question says that Mike found λ2, which is different.

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile, perhaps moving more quickly, which would increase their average speed v. Since λ is proportional to v, that would increase λ.

But wait, the temperature is the same, so the average speed shouldn't change. The average speed depends on temperature. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's approach it from the physics of electron microscopes. In a TEM, the electron beam can cause various effects like electron scattering, heating, and ionization of the sample and any gas present.

When Mike turns on the electron beam, the gas molecules in the compartment are now being bombarded with electrons. This could cause two main effects: 1) the gas molecules could be ionized, and 2) the electrons could impart momentum to the gas molecules, possibly increasing their speed.

If the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and might be repelled by the electron beam's electric field or the charged plates in the microscope. This could cause the ions to be expelled from the compartment, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules (lower n), which would increase the mean free path.

Alternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter might increase (if they expand upon ionization), which would increase the collision cross-section σ, leading to a decrease in λ. But if n decreases more significantly than σ increases, λ would increase.

But I'm not sure about the relative effects. Let's consider another approach: the mean free path without the electron beam is λ1. With the beam on, if gas molecules are being removed, n decreases, so λ increases. Thus, λ2 > λ1.

Now, looking at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

So if λ2 is larger, the options are A or D. But why would λ2 be exactly 1.22 times λ1?

Wait, 1.22 comes into play when considering the Debye length or something else? Or perhaps it's a factor from the mean free path formula when considering electron scattering. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the mean free path in a different context, like electron mean free path versus gas molecule mean free path.

Wait another thought: The mean free path of the electrons in the presence of the gas would be different than the mean free path of the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, not the electrons'. So when Mike is measuring the mean free path based on electron scattering, perhaps he is indirectly measuring the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the electrons are more likely to be scattered, so the effective mean free path for the electrons (which is different from the gas's) would be shorter. But the question is about the gas's mean free path, so that might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas's mean free path is being measured via the electron's scattering events. So if the electrons are more scattered, the observed mean free path for the electrons is different. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the gas properties without considering the electron beam. When the beam is on, the presence of the electrons could cause the gas molecules to have a different mean free path because of electron-induced effects.

Wait, if the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more, perhaps the effective pressure increases. But why would that happen? I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think of it another way. What is the effect of the electron beam on the gas? The electron beam brings a high flux of electrons, which can cause several effects:

1. Gas ionization: electrons collide with gas atoms, causing ionization. Ions are then accelerated or repelled by the electric fields in the microscope, possibly leaving the compartment. This would reduce n, increasing λ.

2. Heating: the energy deposited by the electron beam could heat the gas, which would increase the average speed v of the gas molecules, leading to a longer mean free path. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so this effect is nullified.

3. Coulomb forces: if the gas is ionized, the resulting ions could interact with each other or with the beam, affecting their distribution. But again, this might lead to a lower n.

So, if the electron beam causes ionization and the ions are expelled, n decreases, leading to a longer mean free path λ2. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Looking at the options, options A and D suggest λ2 is larger than λ1. So which one?

The question is, can we conclude anything specific about the factor? The options don't give a specific factor except option A, which says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. So why 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2/ (pi)) or something. Let me think: the formula for the mean free path is λ = 1/(n * π d²), where d is the effective diameter. Alternatively, for a more precise calculation, the collision integral and other factors are considered. But I'm not recalling the exact origin of the 1.22 factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor comes from the relation between the mean free path and the Debye length or something else. Alternatively, maybe in the presence of the electron beam, the effective cross-section increases by a factor of 1.22, but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: considering the mean free path for electron scattering. The electron's mean free path is different from the gas molecule's mean free path. But if Mike is using the electron scattering to infer the gas's mean free path, perhaps the two are inversely related.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in a way that the gas's mean free path becomes shorter. Because the electrons are providing more collisions, but that's for the electrons, not the gas. Alternatively, perhaps the electrons are influencing the gas molecules, causing them to have more frequent collisions, thereby reducing λ.

Wait, but the mean free path λ1 was calculated from the gas's own properties. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to lose some energy, perhaps moving more quickly, but that's not directly affecting the collision rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence increases the number of collisions the gas molecules have with the beam's components, but I'm not sure how that affects their mutual collisions.

Another angle: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be in a different state, perhaps more ionized, leading to a change in the collision cross-section. For example, if the gas molecules are ionized, their diameter effectively increases, leading to a larger σ. So σ increases, which would decrease λ: λ = 1/(n σ), so if σ increases without n changing, λ decreases.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed, n decreases, which would increase λ. So which effect dominates?

If the gas is ionized and expelled, n decreases, λ increases. If σ increases due to ionization, λ decreases. So which effect is more significant?

I'm not certain, but perhaps in an ultra-high vacuum, the effects of ionization and removal are more significant than the change in σ. So n decreases, λ increases. Thus, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But if that's the case, then looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path without the electron beam (λ1) is calculated using the formula based on the ideal gas law and the collision cross-section. When the electron beam is on, the gas is subjected to a higher electric field, causing the ions to drift, possibly leading to a lower effective pressure. Alternatively, the gas ions are attracted to the electron beam, leading to a lower density in the region the electron beam passes through.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a change in the ionization state of the gas, which affects the collision cross-section. For example, if the gas molecules are singly ionized, their effective diameter increases, which would decrease λ. But if they're being expelled, n drops, which increases λ.

But without knowing which effect is dominant, it's hard to say. However, the problem states that the temperature didn't change. So the only way λ changes is if n changes or σ changes.

If the gas is being ionized and expelled, n decreases. So λ increases, λ2 > λ1.

But the question is, what can we conclude? The options suggest that λ2 could be larger or smaller.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path of the gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. Wait, no, the formula is λ ∝ T / (P * d²). So if pressure drops, λ increases.

If the electron beam causes a drop in pressure (n decreases), λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, the options would suggest that λ2 is larger than λ1. Among the options, A and D suggest λ2 >= lambda1, but A is a lower bound, and D is a range.

But the problem states that Mike used the vacuum pumps and the pressure is <1e-9 Torr. When the beam is on, the pressure might be even lower, perhaps. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct answer would be option A or C, but based on reasoning, λ2 is larger. So options A or D.

But the problem says "mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same." So the change must be due to a change in n or σ.

But the problem doesn't give any information about the pressure changing. It just says that when the beam was off, the pressure was less than 1e-9 Torr. When the beam is on, the pressure might change slightly, but I'm not told if it's higher or lower.

Wait, another way to think: When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized. Once ionized, they might be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope and leave the compartment. This would decrease n, leading to a longer mean free path.

If n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

So among the options, A says lambda2 >= 1.22 * lambda1. But why 1.22?

Wait, perhaps there's a standard factor that comes into play here. For example, when considering electron scattering in a gas, the mean free path of the electrons is often given by λ_e = 1.22 * (P in Torr / T in K)^{-1} * 1e6 Å. But that's for electron mean free path.

Wait, but the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons'. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor is from the formula for the mean free path when considering both translational and rotational collisions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas's mean free path might be affected by the increased number of collisions with the electrons, but that's for the gas's cross-section. If the electrons are providing more collisions for the gas molecules, perhaps the effective number of collisions increases. But wait, the mean free path λ is the average distance between collisions among the gas molecules. If the gas molecules are colliding more with electrons, that doesn't affect their collisional mean free path among themselves. So λ for gas-gas collisions should remain the same. Hence, λ2 would be equal to λ1. But the problem says that λ2 is different, so that line of reasoning must be incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that when the electron beam is on, the gas's cross-section for electron scattering is much larger, leading to more scattering events, which the gas molecules experience as additional collisions. But this is for the gas's interaction with the electrons, not with other gas molecules. So it doesn't affect the gas's own mean free path.

Thus, perhaps there's no change in λ. So Mike's observation might be incorrect, which would suggest option B.

But the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1. So perhaps his determination of λ2 is correct, implying that the mean free path has changed. Thus, the mean free path must have changed due to some effect.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be moving faster due to the energy transfer from the electrons. But the problem says the temperature is the same, so that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become excited, leading to a higher effective cross-section for collisions. So σ increases, leading to a lower λ. Hence, λ2 < λ1.

In that case, option C would be correct.

But why would the cross-section increase? If the gas molecules are in a higher energy state (e.g., vibrationally excited), their effective diameter for collisions might increase, making σ larger. So λ would decrease, leading to λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure if that's a significant effect. Alternatively, ionization could cause an increase in σ.

So, if the gas molecules are ionized, their effective cross-section could be larger. So the mean free path would decrease. Thus, λ2 < λ1.

So, in that case, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But wait, another point: if the gas is ionized, the number density of neutral molecules decreases. So n decreases. So λ would increase. But if the cross-section σ increases, the effect on λ depends on which effect is more dominant.

If n decreases by a factor x and σ increases by a factor y, then λ would change by (x/y). So whether λ increases or decreases depends on whether x > y.

But without knowing the values of x and y, it's hard to say. So perhaps the dominant effect is the change in n. If n decreases because gas is being expelled, then λ increases.

So, going back, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 > λ1, so λ2 is greater than λ1.

But the options don't have just a simple λ2> λ1. The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 * λ1

B) λ2 = λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 * λ1

So if λ2 is larger than λ1, the possibilities are A or D.

But the question is, why the factor 1.22? 1.22 is approximately 4/π, which is about 1.27, so close to that. Alternatively, it might be related to the geometry of the collision, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is calculated as λ = L * sqrt(P/(T)) ), but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, the formula for mean free path in a gas is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter.

If the electron beam is causing the gas to ionize, perhaps the effective diameter d increases. So d increases, which would decrease λ. But if the pressure P decreases (because gas is being expelled), then λ would increase. So the net effect depends on which change is more significant.

But without knowing whether d increases more or P decreases more, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's own mean free path. Therefore, λ2 should be equal to λ1, as in option B. But the problem states that Mike found λ2 was different. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be in a different state, such as a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path could be different because the interactions are dominated by electromagnetic forces rather than collisions. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to a change in the effective pressure measured. For example, if the beam is causing the gas to expand, the effective pressure might decrease, leading to a longer mean free path.

But I'm not getting anywhere definitive. Let's try to think of the options again. The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22 * λ1

B) λ2 = λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22 * λ1

Based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas to be expelled, thus reducing n, which increases λ. So λ2 > λ1. So the only options that fit are A and D.

But what's the factor 1.22? Maybe it's a standard factor in electron microscopy for the mean free path when the beam is on. Alternatively, perhaps when considering electron scattering, the mean free path is 1.22 times longer than the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, the confusion arises because when the electron beam is on, the effective cross-section for electron scattering is higher, but that's for the electrons, not the gas.

Wait, perhaps the initial mean free path λ1 is for the gas molecules, and the observed λ2 is for the electrons. But the question says Mike observed the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So it's the gas's mean free path as deduced from the electron scattering.

In that case, the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas's effective cross-section to increase. So σ increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 < λ1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if the gas is being expelled, n decreases, leading to a longer λ. So which effect is more significant?

If the pressure is unchanged, but the effective cross-section increases due to ionization, then λ decreases. But if the pressure drops, λ increases. So it's a trade-off between n and σ.

But without more information, perhaps we can only conclude that λ2 is not equal to λ1, meaning that the correct answer is either A, C, or D.

But the problem says that the temperature remains the same. So any change in λ must come from a change in n or σ.

If the beam causes gas to be expelled, n decreases, λ increases. So λ2> λ1.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the gas to ionize, increasing σ, λ decreases.

But in an ultra-high vacuum, the dominant effect is likely to be the change in gas density, not the cross-section.

Therefore, λ2> λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But the question is whether λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1 (option A) or somewhere in between (option D).

But without knowing the exact change, perhaps the correct answer is C: λ2 < λ1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The mean free path is based on the gas's own collisions. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons. But the mean free path among the gas molecules is determined by their mutual collisions. So the presence of the electron beam shouldn't affect the mutual collisions, so λ should remain the same.

But the problem says that Mike found λ2 different. So perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is less than or greater than λ1, but which?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be heated, which would increase the average speed. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so that can't be.

Another possibility: perhaps the electron beam's magnetic field or electric field affects the gas molecules' movement, causing them to have a longer mean free path. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the reasoning that the electron beam causes gas to be expelled, leading to a lower n and thus a longer mean free path, λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why 1.22? Maybe because the effective cross-section for electron-gas interactions is higher, which the mean free path is calculated based on that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor 1.22 is part of the formula for the mean free path when considering electron scattering. For example, the mean free path for electrons in a gas is given by λ_e = 1.22 * (P / T)^(-1/2) * 1e6 Å. But that's for electrons, not the gas.

In any case, the options don't give a specific factor except A and D. Without more information, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path actually decreases because the gas molecules are more likely to scatter electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, but that's for the electrons.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure experienced by the gas molecules, causing their mean free path to be shorter. But that's unclear.

In the end, I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1, because the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more ionized, increasing their cross-section and thus reducing the mean free path. But I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum chamber when an electron beam is turned on. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is given by:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \cdot \sigma \cdot v_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, \(\sigma\) is the collision cross-section, and \(v_{\text{avg}}\) is the average molecular speed. For an ideal gas, \(n = \frac{P}{kT}\), where \(P\) is pressure, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is temperature.

2. **Effect of Electron Beam**:
   - The electron beam can cause ionization of gas molecules, increasing the effective collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)) due to changes in molecular size or charge.
   - Ionization may also lead to gas molecules being expelled from the compartment, reducing the number density (\(n\)).

3. **Pressure and Temperature**:
   - The problem states that the temperature remains constant, so \(v_{\text{avg}}\) does not change.
   - If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be expelled, \(n\) decreases, leading to an increase in \(\lambda\). Conversely, if ionization increases \(\sigma\), \(\lambda\) decreases.

4. **Trade-offs**:
   - A decrease in \(n\) (due to gas expulsion) increases \(\lambda\).
   - An increase in \(\sigma\) (due to ionization) decreases \(\lambda\).
   - The net effect depends on whether the reduction in \(n\) dominates over the increase in \(\sigma\).

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a significant increase in \(\lambda\). This would occur if gas expulsion dominates, leading to a substantial reduction in \(n\).
   - **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: Implies no change in \(\lambda\), which contradicts the problem statement that \(\lambda_2\) is different.
   - **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a decrease in \(\lambda\), which would occur if ionization increases \(\sigma\) more significantly than \(n\) decreases.
   - **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \cdot \lambda_1\))**: Suggests a moderate increase in \(\lambda\), indicating a partial reduction in \(n\) without reaching the full factor of 1.22.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The dominant effect is likely the increase in \(\sigma\) due to ionization, leading to a decrease in \(\lambda\). This aligns with **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**.
