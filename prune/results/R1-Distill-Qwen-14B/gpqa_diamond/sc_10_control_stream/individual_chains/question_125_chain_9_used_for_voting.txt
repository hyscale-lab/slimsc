Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is the same in all directions, so it's spherically symmetric. The force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because the potential is quadratic in r, like a spring.

The question asks two things: first, the energy of the third excited state, and second, how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think I remember that in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, no, wait—since it's isotropic, maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial part and angular parts. Or perhaps more accurately, since it's three-dimensional, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number or some combination of the quantum numbers.

Wait, for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta. But wait, let me think again. No, wait, that's for the isotropic 3D case. Each direction (x, y, z) contributes (n_x + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up: E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z determines the energy as E = (n + 3/2) ħω. But wait, sometimes I've seen the energy expressed in terms of the principal quantum number n which includes the radial and angular parts. Oh wait, no, I think in the three-dimensional case, the energy levels are defined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction is a 1D oscillator, and the total energy is the sum of the energies in each.

So the energy depends on the sum of n_x, n_y, and n_z. Each of these can be 0,1,2,... So the possible energies are E(n_x + n_y + n_z) = (n + 3/2) ħω, with n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. So the first excited state is the next one, then the second, then the third. So the third excited state would be the fourth energy level, counting from zero.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which is n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0). The first excited state is the lowest energy state with n=1, which can be achieved by increasing one of the quantum numbers by one. Then the second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3.

So for the third excited state, the sum n =3.

So the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's the first part of the question.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct ways can the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z sum up to 3? Each combination of n_x, n_y, n_z that adds up to 3 gives a different eigenstate, and these are non-degenerate except for the same sum.

Wait, no. Actually, the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy is the number of distinct ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers. So this is a combinatorics problem: find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x + y + z = n is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, this would be (3 + 2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, that's the number of states for each particular energy level, right? Because each (n_x, n_y, n_z) gives a distinct eigenstate with the same energy E=(n +3/2) ħω when n=3.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) is 10.

Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. That matches.

Option C says (9/2) ħω and 3. That's the number of quantum numbers, but the number of states is higher. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about this: each energy level in 3D harmonic oscillator is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So for each value of n, the degeneracy is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, that's (3+2 choose 2) = 10. So yes, the degeneracy is 10.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in the three spatial directions. The total energy is expressed as:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of distinct ways to distribute \( n \) quanta among the three directions, which is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the degeneracy of this energy level. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for \( n = 3 \) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** correctly states the energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the degeneracy 10.
- **Option C** incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3, which is the number of quantum numbers but not the number of eigenfunctions.
- **Options B and D** are incorrect because they involve unrelated expressions for energy and degeneracy.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

The first excited state is the lowest energy state with n=1, which can be achieved by increasing one of the quantum numbers by one. Then the second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3.

So for the third excited state, the sum n =3.

So the energy is E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's the first part of the question.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct ways can the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z sum up to 3? Each combination of n_x, n_y, n_z that adds up to 3 gives a different eigenstate, and these are non-degenerate except for the same sum.

Wait, no. Actually, the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy is the number of distinct ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers. So this is a combinatorics problem: find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x + y + z = n is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, this would be (3 + 2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions.

Wait, that's the number of states for each particular energy level, right? Because each (n_x, n_y, n_z) gives a distinct eigenstate with the same energy E=(n +3/2) ħω when n=3.

So putting it together, the energy is (9/2) ħω and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) is 10.

Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. That matches.

Option C says (9/2) ħω and 3. That's the number of quantum numbers, but the number of states is higher. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about this: each energy level in 3D harmonic oscillator is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So for each value of n, the degeneracy is (n + 2 choose 2). So for n=3, that's (3+2 choose 2) = 10. So yes, the degeneracy is 10.

So the correct answer is option A.
