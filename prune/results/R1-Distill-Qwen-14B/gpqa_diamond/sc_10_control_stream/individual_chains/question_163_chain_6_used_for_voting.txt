Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it should form a salt and water. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, right? So it should react with acid in a neutralization reaction.

The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, but H+ comes from the strong acid. So yeah, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the H+ needed is 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it's providing one H+ per molecule. The concentration is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So the volume needed can be found using the formula: moles = concentration * volume → volume = moles / concentration.

Wait, let me write that down: volume (in liters) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. Oh, but the options are like 28.05, 30.09, etc. So that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait another thing: the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the total volume might change a bit, but I think the problem assumes that the acid volume is added to the solution, making the total volume a bit more than 100 cm³. But wait, no, the total volume is already 100 cm³, so perhaps the acid is added to that. Hmm, but I think the problem is saying that the total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid is being added, so the volume of the acid is part of that. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after adding the acid and Fe(OH)3 will have a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid's volume added plus the volume of the solution plus any volume changes are all part of the 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the final volume, so the acid's volume is part of that.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation as I did before. Because regardless, the moles of H+ needed are 0.002808, and the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the closest option is C, which has 28.05 cm³.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions. So I need to find the concentration of Fe^3+ and then find the pH.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The solution after adding the acid will contain Fe^3+ and possibly excess H+. Oh, because the moles of H+ added are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, right? So all the Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, but then the solution's pH will depend on the concentration of Fe^3+ and any possible hydrolysis.

Wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it reacts with the strong acid, it forms Fe^3+ and water. But Fe^3+ in solution can hydrolyze, making the solution acidic. So the solution will have Fe^3+ which undergoes hydrolysis.

So to find the pH, we need to calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ and then find the pH based on its hydrolysis.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

Moles of Fe^3+ is same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. So concentration is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, wait. Let me check that:

0.1 g Fe(OH)3 → 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

After dissolving, all of this becomes Fe^3+.

So [Fe^3+] = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Fe^3+ is a cation that undergoes hydrolysis in water. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The hydrolysis constant (K) can be found using the K for Fe(OH)3's dissolution. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the hydrolysis.

But I might need to find the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I remember that for transition metal ions, their hydrolysis can be considered using the formula pH = (pKa + log c) / 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using the hydrolysis expression.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be represented as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Wait, but I don't remember the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of a salt of a weak base.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but when it reacts with acid, the solution becomes acidic. The Fe^3+ ions will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis can be considered as Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid in this context.

Wait, no, wait: Fe(OH)3 is a weak base usually, but when it's in solution as Fe^3+ (from acid), it can act as an acid. So the hydrolysis is the reverse of the base reaction.

Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be treated as a weak acid. Let me think. So the hydrolysis reaction would be:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

But I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Maybe it's better to write it as Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, perhaps I should find the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I can look up the K value. Wait, I think the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is around 1e-33, but I'm not confident. Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, actually, the pH can be found using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak base. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base (with Kb), the solution of Fe^3+ will be acidic. The pH can be found by considering the hydrolysis.

The formula for pH when a salt of a weak base is dissolved in water is:

pH = (pKa + log C) / 2

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a salt of a weak base, say B(OH)3, when it's dissolved in water, it can hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. But in this case, Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. So when Fe^3+ is in water, it can donate a proton, making the solution acidic.

So the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Ka = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+].

But I don't have the exact value of Ka for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe(OH)3's dissolution. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so its dissolution would be:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-

The K for this is the solubility product, Ksp. Let me think, I think the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-37 at 25°C. Wait, but that's the Ksp for the dissolution, which is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So if I'm considering the reverse, which is the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in water, the K would be the same as Ksp. Wait, no. Because the dissolution is Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-, so Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the K for this reaction would be Kw / Ksp.

Wait, let me think. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq); Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction would be Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + ... ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and doesn't appear in the K expression. So the K for the hydrolysis is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. Hmm, perhaps I can relate the two.

Alternatively, since the hydrolysis is Fe^3+ + H2O → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the hydrolysis can be treated as a weak acid, with some initial concentration.

So, initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let me let x be the concentration of H+ produced per liter. So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[H+] = x + any H+ from water, but since x is likely small compared to 1e-7, it's negligible.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x will be much smaller than 0.00936).

But wait, the reaction releases 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

Wait, maybe I should write the correct hydrolysis equation.

Let me think again. The correct hydrolysis equation for Fe^3+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for K would be [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't appear in the K expression. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. So Ksp = 6e-37.

The K for the hydrolysis reaction is K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from water, [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp: [Fe^3+][ (1e-14)/[H+] ) ]^3 = 6e-37.

Rearranging, [Fe^3+] = 6e-37 * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) ) → [Fe^3+] = 6e-37 * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) ) → [Fe^3+] = 6e5 [H+]^3.

But [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M. So 0.00936 = 6e5 * [H+]^3 → [H+]^3 = 0.00936 / (6e5) → 0.00936 / 6e5 = 1.56e-8 → [H+]^3 = 1.56e-8 → [H+] = (1.56e-8)^(1/3) ≈ 2.49e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈ 2.49e-3 M. Then pH = -log(2.49e-3) ≈ 2.60.

Wait, that's around pH 2.6, but let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, let me re-do the calculation.

Ksp = 6e-37 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

From the hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The K for hydrolysis (Kh) is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = ( (1e-7) )^3 / [Fe^3+] ? No, perhaps because I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, let me set up the equation again.

Hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+.

Equilibrium expression:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K_h.

But K_h is related to the solubility product.

Wait, the solubility product is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But from the hydrolysis, we have:

[H+] = 3x (assuming x is the extent of hydrolysis), and [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+] = 1e-14 / (3x).

So substituting into Ksp:

[Fe^3+] * (1e-14 / (3x))^3 = Ksp → [Fe^3+] = Ksp * (3x)^3 / (1e-42).

But [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, so:

0.00936 = (6e-37) * (3x)^3 / 1e-42 → 0.00936 = 6e-37 * 27 x^3 / 1e-42 → 0.00936 = (1.62e-35 x^3 ) → x^3 = 0.00936 / 1.62e-35 → x^3 ≈ 5.78e32 → x ≈ cube root(5.78e32) ≈ 3.87e10 M. That can't be right; that's impossible because the concentration can't be that high.

Wait, that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and it hydrolyzes to produce H+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Each mole of Fe^3+ produces 3 moles of H+. So the initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's let x be the amount that reacts.

So, [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x is likely small).

[H+] = 3x.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't appear in K. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp is for Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3OH^-. So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

So the K for hydrolysis is K_h = 1/(Ksp * Kw^3). Because Kw is [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the K expressions.

Let me write the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 as:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq) ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction is:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) ; K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. Let me write this as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Which can be rewritten as:

Fe^3+ + 3H+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ + 3H2O.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to relate K_h to Ksp and Kw.

So, given that:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

For the reverse reaction (the hydrolysis of Fe^3+), the K is 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+.

Which can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's omitted, so K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But how is this related to Ksp?

Well, Ksp is for the dissolution into Fe^3+ and OH^-.

So, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

If I take the hydrolysis reaction and reverse the dissolution:

Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) ; K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis involves H+.

Let me think of the hydrolysis in terms of H+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Which can be rewritten as: Fe^3+ + 3H+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3H2O.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the hydrolysis reaction in terms of the dissolution and the autoionization of water.

This is getting a bit complicated, perhaps I should find a different approach. Maybe I can find the pH using the formula for a weak acid solution.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis produces 'x' moles of H+ per liter.

So, [H+] = 3x (since each Fe^3+ gives 3 H+), and [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936 (since x is small compared to 0.00936).

The K for hydrolysis would be (3x)^3 / 0.00936 = K_h.

But I don't know K_h. Alternatively, I can find K_h using the Ksp and Kw.

Wait, I think K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Because, from the dissolution, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+], so Ksp = [Fe^3+][ (Kw / [H+] ) ]^3.

Rearranging, [Fe^3+] = Ksp * [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

So, [Fe^3+] = (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3.

But in the hydrolysis, [Fe^3+] is 0.00936, and [H+] is 3x.

So, 0.00936 = (Ksp / Kw^3) * (3x)^3.

Wait, but if I'm considering the hydrolysis, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+], so:

K_h = (3x)^3 / 0.00936.

But from the previous equation,

0.00936 = (Ksp / Kw^3) * (3x)^3 → (3x)^3 = 0.00936 * Kw^3 / Ksp.

Substituting into K_h:

K_h = (0.00936 * Kw^3 / Ksp) / 0.00936 → K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So, K_h = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 → (1e-42) / 6e-37 = approximately 1.666e-6.

So K_h ≈ 1.666e-5.

Wait, let me compute that again.

(1e-14)^3 is 1e-42.

6e-37 is Ksp.

So K_h = (1e-42) / (6e-37) ) = (1/6) * 1e-5 → approximately 1.6667e-6.

So K_h ≈ 1.6667e-6.

Now, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

We can set [H+] = 3x, and [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936.

So,

( (3x)^3 ) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 → (27x^3) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 → x^3 = (1.6667e-6 * 0.00936) ) / 27.

Calculate numerator: 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

Divide by 27: 1.56e-8 / 27 ≈ 5.78e-10.

So x^3 ≈ 5.78e-10 → x ≈ cube root(5.78e-10) ≈ 8.33e-4.

So [H+] = 3x ≈ 2.5e-3 M.

pH = -log10(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.60.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2.5e-3 is 0.0025.

Log10(0.0025) = log(2.5e-3) = log(2.5) + log(1e-3) → 0.39794 + (-3) → -2.60206.

So pH is 2.60.

Looking at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³.

Option B is pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm³.

Wait, our calculation gives pH ≈ 2.60, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69, but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate K_h.

K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kw^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp is given as 6e-37.

So K_h = 1e-42 / 6e-37 → (1/6) * 1e-5 → 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

So, [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → (3x)^3 = K_h * 0.00936 → 27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = approx 1.56e-8.

So x^3 = 1.56e-8 / 27 ≈ 5.78e-10 → x ≈ 8.33e-4.

So [H+] = 3x = 2.5e-3 → pH = 2.60.

Wait, but none of the options have pH 2.60. The closest is option B, pH 2.69, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to account for activity coefficients or more precise Ksp values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hydrolysis produces less H+ because the solution volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration is 0.00936 M, as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Ostwald dilution law for the hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K_h.

We have K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) = 1e-42 / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approximately 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → [H+] = cube_root( K_h * [Fe^3+] )

= cube_root( 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ) → cube_root( 1.56e-8 ) → approximately 2.49e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.49e-3) → log(2.49) is about 0.3969 → pH = 2.603.

So about 2.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K_h.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the hydrolysis is more significant, and [Fe^3+] is not approximately 0.00936.

Wait, let's try solving without making the approximation.

Let [H+] = 3x.

The equation is:

(3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x) ) = 1.6667e-6.

Expanding,

27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 (0.00936 - x )

→ 27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 - 1.6667e-6 x.

Compute 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

So,

27x^3 + 1.6667e-6 x - 1.56e-8 = 0.

This is a cubic equation. Let me try an approximate solution.

Assume x is much smaller than 0.00936, so 27x^3 ≈ 1.56e-8 → x^3 ≈ 5.77e-10 → x≈8.33e-4. So [H+] = 2.5e-3, as before.

But if x is not negligible, perhaps I should check.

Let me plug x=8.33e-4 into the equation.

27*(8.33e-4)^3 = 27*(5.78e-10) )=1.56e-8.

The term 1.6667e-6 * x = 1.6667e-6 * 8.33e-4 = approx 1.388e-9.

So equation becomes 1.56e-8 + 1.388e-9 ≈ 1.7e-8 on left side, which is bigger than 1.56e-8 on the right. So perhaps x is a bit smaller.

But this probably won't change the pH much. So I think our initial assumption is correct.

But looking at the options, the pH isn't matching. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the H+ needed for dissolving Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Each mole requires 3 moles H+ → 0.002808 mol H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 → 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³.

Which matches option C's volume of 28.05 cm³.

But according to our earlier calculation, the pH is about 2.60, but option C has pH 2.04. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Maybe the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is different.

Wait, I looked up that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-37, yes. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when Fe(OH)3 is added to the acid, the solution becomes a solution of Fe^3+ and excess H+.

Wait, wait a second. The initial reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

If we add exactly the amount of H+ needed, the solution would have [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M and [H+] from water only, which would be around pH 2.6.

But perhaps when you add a strong acid, the solution's H+ is mainly from the acid, not from the hydrolysis. Wait, but in this case, we're adding just enough H+ to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, so the only H+ comes from the acid and any hydrolysis.

Wait, wait! Oh, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved in the strong acid, the solution may have excess H+ from the acid. No, wait, no. Because the problem asks for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So, the acid's H+ is just enough to react with Fe(OH)3. So after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+? No, wait, because we're adding the minimum volume, the H+ is exactly enough to react with Fe(OH)3, so there would be no excess H+.

Wait, wait a minute. When you add acid to dissolve the base, the acid is in stoichiometric amount, so the solution after reaction would have Fe^3+ and any H+ from water.

No, wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Because the acid is monobasic and strong, the reaction goes to completion. So all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution has Fe^3+ and H+ from the acid in excess.

Wait, no, because the stoichiometric amount of acid is added. So after reaction, all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved into Fe^3+ and H2O. So the H+ comes from the acid: moles of H+ added is 0.002808 mol, which is 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3.

The volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so [H+] = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M.

But wait, no. Because the H+ comes from the acid, which is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. So after the reaction, the H+ concentration is 0.02808 M, but that's only the H+ from the acid. But wait, the Fe^3+ will hydrolyze to produce more H+.

So the H+ in solution is from two sources: the excess acid (but in this case, it's exactly the needed amount, so no excess) and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, no, because we're adding exactly the amount of acid needed to react with Fe(OH)3. So the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. So the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, that's a key point. So when you add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O goes to completion, and the resulting solution has Fe^3+ and water. The only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the [H+] is determined by the hydrolysis.

But earlier, when I calculated the pH based on hydrolysis, I got about pH 2.60, which is close to option B, which has pH 2.69.

Wait, let me think again. The volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so total volume is 100 cm³.

So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is in 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and the H+ comes from that.

So going back to the K_h calculation.

We have K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8 → [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) ≈ 2.49e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.60.

But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise Ksp value. Let me look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 × 10^-37 at 25°C.

So K_h = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) ) = (1e-42) / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct K_h is higher, which would lead to a higher [H+] and lower pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces more H+.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation without approximations.

Let me write the equation again:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M,

K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 * 9.36e-3 → 1.6667e-6 * 9.36e-3 = 1.56e-8.

So [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) ≈ 2.49e-3 M.

So pH = -log(2.49e-3) → log(2.49) is about 0.3969 → pH = 2.603.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option B (pH 2.69) and option C (pH 2.04).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction. Maybe the reaction produces more H+ because of the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction releases 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

Wait, no, that's what I already considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis, but I'm miscalculating the K_h.

Another thought: maybe the K_h is calculated differently.

Wait, from Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We can write [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3) ) ) = Kw^(1) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3) / (Ksp)^(1/3).

So [H+] = (Kw / Ksp )^(1/3) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14,

Ksp = 6e-37,

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = (1e-14 / 6e-37 )^(1/3) * (0.00936)^(1/3).

Calculate (1e-14 /6e-37) = (1/6) * 1e23 → approx 1.6667e22.

Cube root of 1.6667e22 → (1.6667e22)^(1/3) ≈ 2.58e7.

Cube root of 0.00936 → approx 0.21.

So,

[H+] ≈ 2.58e7 * 0.21 ≈ 5.42e6 M.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give a pH of about -6.7, which is impossible.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1e-14 /6e-37 ) = 1e-14 /6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e23 → 1.6667e22.

Cube root of 1.6667e22 is (1.6667e22)^(1/3) → Let's see, 1e22 is (1e7.333)^3 ≈ (1e7.333)^3 = 1e22.

So the cube root is approximately 2.58e7.

Then, [Fe^3+]^(1/3) = (0.00936)^(1/3) → 0.00936 is about 1e-2.027 → cube root is 1e-0.675 ≈ 0.21.

So [H+] = 2.58e7 * 0.21 ≈ 5.42e6 M. That's way too high, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem using the hydrolysis expression correctly.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K_h is [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

We have K_h = 1.6667e-6.

So,

[H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-8.

So, [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) → approx 2.49e-3 → pH ≈ 2.60.

So I think our initial calculation is correct. But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 1e-37, not 6e-37.

If Ksp = 1e-37, then K_h = (1e-14)^3 / 1e-37 = 1e-42 / 1e-37 = 1e-5.

Then, [H+]^3 = 1e-5 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-8.

So [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-8) ≈ 4.55e-3 → pH ≈ 2.34.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the acid is added, it contributes H+ which affects the pH.

Wait, but in the problem, we're adding the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the H+ comes from two sources: the acid and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, no, because the acid is added to exactly neutralize the Fe(OH)3. So all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, leaving only H+ from the hydrolysis.

So the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis.

But according to our calculations, that's pH ~2.6.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B with pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But our calculation for the volume is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But why is the pH so low?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the solution after the reaction has excess H+ from the acid. No, because we added exactly the amount needed for neutralization, so there's no excess H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not 1:3 but something else. Let me recheck.

Fe(OH)3 has the formula Fe(OH)3, which is a base. When it reacts with a strong acid, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Yes, so 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid needed: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 28.08 cm³ → which is option C's volume.

But the pH in option C is 2.04, which is much lower than our calculation of ~2.6.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the Ksp value. Let me look up the exact Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, I find that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-37, which matches what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the pH. Let me try a different approach.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me let x be the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts. Then,

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936.

[H+] = 3x.

The K_h expression is:

K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = (3x)^3 / 0.00936 = 27x^3 / 0.00936.

Set K_h = 1.6667e-6.

So,

27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-8.

x^3 = 5.78e-10 → x ≈ 8.33e-4.

[H+] = 3x = 2.5e-3 → pH = 2.60.

Still, no option matches. So perhaps there's an error in the K_h calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce OH- instead of H+.

But no, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so Fe^3+ should act as an acid, releasing H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the K_h is calculated differently. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should write the hydrolysis as Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

In that case, the stoichiometry is 1:1, and the K would be different.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me proceed.

If the reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+,

then K = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the Ksp.

Wait, Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-37.

Assuming that Fe(OH)^2+ is a step in the hydrolysis, perhaps the K for Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ can be found.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated, and I might be overcomplicating things.

Another thought: perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that can't be right because we've used exactly the needed amount of acid.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume. So when I added 28.08 cm³ of acid to 100 cm³ of solution, the total volume is 128.08 cm³. But the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps I should account for that.

Wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So if I add V cm³ of acid, then the total volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. So the initial solution is perhaps 100 cm³, and adding V cm³ of acid would make the total volume 100 + V cm³. But the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps V is the volume of acid added, making the total volume 100 cm³.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me re-read the question.

The problem says: "We would like to dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume."

So the solution after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So when the acid is added, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So the acid's volume is part of this 100 cm³.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the solution already has some volume before adding the acid. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution made by dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So the initial volume (before adding acid) plus the acid volume equals 100 cm³.

But it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³, so the volume of acid added plus the volume of the solution (water) is 100 cm³.

But without knowing the initial volume of the solution, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume of acid added is negligible compared to 100 cm³, so the total volume remains approximately 100 cm³.

But regardless, the calculation for the moles of H+ needed is 0.002808 mol, and the volume of 0.1 M acid is 28.08 cm³.

So the answer is option C, which has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But according to my calculations, the pH is around 2.6, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that would only be the case if the acid is in excess.

Wait, no, because we're adding the minimum amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation. Let me check again.

K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kw^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp = 6e-37 → K_h = 1e-42 / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 → 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

So, [H+] = cube_root( K_h * [Fe^3+] ) → cube_root(1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ) → cube_root(1.56e-8) → 2.49e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which has pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+.

Wait, 0.1 grams Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass: Fe = ~55.85 g/mol, O=16, H=1. So 55.85 + 3*(16+1) = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Molar mass correct.

Moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³. So option C's volume is 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

But the pH is 2.60, not matching any option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the pH in the options is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation.

Wait, perhaps the solution also contains some OH- from water, but that's negligible compared to H+ from the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H+ concentration includes both from the acid and the hydrolysis. But no, the acid is used up in the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid, but that would require adding more acid than needed.

But the problem states that we're adding the minimum amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so the H+ comes only from the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for a weak acid:

pH = ½ (pKa - log C)

Wait, but I don't know the pKa of the hydrolysis product. Alternatively, perhaps I can find pKa from K_h.

We have K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

If I treat this as K_a for a triprotic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each Fe^3+ contributes 3 H+, so the effective concentration is 3C, where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

So, [H+] = sqrt(3C * K_h).

Wait, perhaps that's another approach. Let me try.

Assume that each Fe^3+ releases 3 H+, so the concentration of H+ is 3√(C * K_h).

C is 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = 3√(0.00936 * 1.6667e-6 ) → 3√(1.56e-8 ) → 3 * 1.25e-4 → 3.75e-4.

pH = -log(3.75e-4 ) → log(3.75) is about 0.574 → pH = 3.426.

Still not matching any option.

This is getting frustrating. Perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the pH should be around 2.6, but option C has pH 2.04. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps the K_h is 1e-5.

If K_h = 1e-5,

[H+]^3 = 1e-5 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-8 → [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-8) ≈ 4.55e-3 → pH ≈ 2.34.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the K_h is 1e-3.

Then [H+]^3 = 1e-3 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-6 → [H+] ≈ 2.1e-2 → pH ≈ 1.68.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But according to my calculations, the pH should be around 2.6, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact expression without approximations.

Let me write the equation again:

[H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = 1.56e-8.

So,

[H+] = (1.56e-8 )^(1/3) ≈ 2.49e-3 → pH ≈ 2.60.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the pH in the options is rounded or calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the hydrolysis and only consider the H+ from the acid, which would give pH = 2.85 (from [H+] = 0.028 M), but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But no, because we've neutralized all the Fe(OH)3.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculations I did, which give volume 28.08 cm³ and pH 2.6. Since option C has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, and option B has 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69, I think the correct answer is option C, and possibly the pH is miscalculated in the options. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the pH is calculated without considering the hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but let's see.

[H+] = 0.02808 M → pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55 → pH ≈ 1.55, which is not an option.

So, I think the correct answer is option C, 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But I'm not confident about the pH part.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution and calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

### Step 1: Reaction and Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and a strong acid is:
\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
- The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3 \times (16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
  \]
- The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
  \[
  \text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Moles of H⁺ Required
From the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of Acid Required
The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume of acid required is:
\[
\text{Volume of acid} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Concentration of acid}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: pH of the Resulting Solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which undergo hydrolysis:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this hydrolysis is related to the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3.
\]
Given \(K_{sp} = 6 \times 10^{-37}\) and \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\), the hydrolysis constant (\(K_h\)) is:
\[
K_h = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-37}} = 1.6667 \times 10^{-6}.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the hydrolysis equilibrium:
\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]},
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K_h \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.6667 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (0.00936) = 1.56 \times 10^{-8}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt[3]{1.56 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 2.49 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(2.49 \times 10^{-3})} \approx 2.60.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with Options
- The calculated volume of acid is approximately \(28.08 \, \text{cm}^3\), which matches closely with option C (\(28.05 \, \text{cm}^3\)).
- The calculated pH is approximately \(2.60\), but none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is B (\(\text{pH} = 2.69\)).

Given the calculations, the correct answer is **option C**, as it provides the closest volume to the calculated value, even though the pH in the options does not perfectly align with the calculated value.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it should form a salt and water. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, right? So it should react with acid in a neutralization reaction.

The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Oh wait, but H+ comes from the strong acid. So yeah, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate that. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the H+ needed is 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so it's providing one H+ per molecule. The concentration is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So the volume needed can be found using the formula: moles = concentration * volume → volume = moles / concentration.

Wait, let me write that down: volume (in liters) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. Oh, but the options are like 28.05, 30.09, etc. So that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait another thing: the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the total volume might change a bit, but I think the problem assumes that the acid volume is added to the solution, making the total volume a bit more than 100 cm³. But wait, no, the total volume is already 100 cm³, so perhaps the acid is added to that. Hmm, but I think the problem is saying that the total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid is being added, so the volume of the acid is part of that. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after adding the acid and Fe(OH)3 will have a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid's volume added plus the volume of the solution plus any volume changes are all part of the 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the final volume, so the acid's volume is part of that.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation as I did before. Because regardless, the moles of H+ needed are 0.002808, and the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the closest option is C, which has 28.05 cm³.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions. So I need to find the concentration of Fe^3+ and then find the pH.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The solution after adding the acid will contain Fe^3+ and possibly excess H+. Oh, because the moles of H+ added are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, right? So all the Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, but then the solution's pH will depend on the concentration of Fe^3+ and any possible hydrolysis.

Wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it reacts with the strong acid, it forms Fe^3+ and water. But Fe^3+ in solution can hydrolyze, making the solution acidic. So the solution will have Fe^3+ which undergoes hydrolysis.

So to find the pH, we need to calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ and then find the pH based on its hydrolysis.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

Moles of Fe^3+ is same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. So concentration is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, wait. Let me check that:

0.1 g Fe(OH)3 → 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

After dissolving, all of this becomes Fe^3+.

So [Fe^3+] = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Fe^3+ is a cation that undergoes hydrolysis in water. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The hydrolysis constant (K) can be found using the K for Fe(OH)3's dissolution. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the hydrolysis.

But I might need to find the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I remember that for transition metal ions, their hydrolysis can be considered using the formula pH = (pKa + log c) / 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using the hydrolysis expression.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be represented as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Wait, but I don't remember the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the pH using the formula for the hydrolysis of a salt of a weak base.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but when it reacts with acid, the solution becomes acidic. The Fe^3+ ions will hydrolyze to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis can be considered as Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid in this context.

Wait, no, wait: Fe(OH)3 is a weak base usually, but when it's in solution as Fe^3+ (from acid), it can act as an acid. So the hydrolysis is the reverse of the base reaction.

Alternatively, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be treated as a weak acid. Let me think. So the hydrolysis reaction would be:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

But I'm not sure about the exact stoichiometry. Maybe it's better to write it as Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, perhaps I should find the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, I can look up the K value. Wait, I think the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is around 1e-33, but I'm not confident. Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, actually, the pH can be found using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak base. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base (with Kb), the solution of Fe^3+ will be acidic. The pH can be found by considering the hydrolysis.

The formula for pH when a salt of a weak base is dissolved in water is:

pH = (pKa + log C) / 2

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a salt of a weak base, say B(OH)3, when it's dissolved in water, it can hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. But in this case, Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. So when Fe^3+ is in water, it can donate a proton, making the solution acidic.

So the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Ka = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+].

But I don't have the exact value of Ka for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe(OH)3's dissolution. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so its dissolution would be:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-

The K for this is the solubility product, Ksp. Let me think, I think the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-37 at 25°C. Wait, but that's the Ksp for the dissolution, which is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So if I'm considering the reverse, which is the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in water, the K would be the same as Ksp. Wait, no. Because the dissolution is Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^-, so Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, the reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the K for this reaction would be Kw / Ksp.

Wait, let me think. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq); Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction would be Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + ... ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant and doesn't appear in the K expression. So the K for the hydrolysis is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. Hmm, perhaps I can relate the two.

Alternatively, since the hydrolysis is Fe^3+ + H2O → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the hydrolysis can be treated as a weak acid, with some initial concentration.

So, initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let me let x be the concentration of H+ produced per liter. So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[H+] = x + any H+ from water, but since x is likely small compared to 1e-7, it's negligible.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x will be much smaller than 0.00936).

But wait, the reaction releases 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

Wait, maybe I should write the correct hydrolysis equation.

Let me think again. The correct hydrolysis equation for Fe^3+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The expression for K would be [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K.

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't appear in the K expression. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. So Ksp = 6e-37.

The K for the hydrolysis reaction is K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from water, [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Substituting into Ksp: [Fe^3+][ (1e-14)/[H+] ) ]^3 = 6e-37.

Rearranging, [Fe^3+] = 6e-37 * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) ) → [Fe^3+] = 6e-37 * [H+]^3 / (1e-42) ) → [Fe^3+] = 6e5 [H+]^3.

But [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M. So 0.00936 = 6e5 * [H+]^3 → [H+]^3 = 0.00936 / (6e5) → 0.00936 / 6e5 = 1.56e-8 → [H+]^3 = 1.56e-8 → [H+] = (1.56e-8)^(1/3) ≈ 2.49e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈ 2.49e-3 M. Then pH = -log(2.49e-3) ≈ 2.60.

Wait, that's around pH 2.6, but let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, let me re-do the calculation.

Ksp = 6e-37 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

From the hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The K for hydrolysis (Kh) is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = ( (1e-7) )^3 / [Fe^3+] ? No, perhaps because I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, let me set up the equation again.

Hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3 H+.

Equilibrium expression:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K_h.

But K_h is related to the solubility product.

Wait, the solubility product is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But from the hydrolysis, we have:

[H+] = 3x (assuming x is the extent of hydrolysis), and [OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+] = 1e-14 / (3x).

So substituting into Ksp:

[Fe^3+] * (1e-14 / (3x))^3 = Ksp → [Fe^3+] = Ksp * (3x)^3 / (1e-42).

But [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, so:

0.00936 = (6e-37) * (3x)^3 / 1e-42 → 0.00936 = 6e-37 * 27 x^3 / 1e-42 → 0.00936 = (1.62e-35 x^3 ) → x^3 = 0.00936 / 1.62e-35 → x^3 ≈ 5.78e32 → x ≈ cube root(5.78e32) ≈ 3.87e10 M. That can't be right; that's impossible because the concentration can't be that high.

Wait, that can't be correct. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and it hydrolyzes to produce H+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Each mole of Fe^3+ produces 3 moles of H+. So the initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's let x be the amount that reacts.

So, [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x is likely small).

[H+] = 3x.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't appear in K. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp is for Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3OH^-. So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

So the K for hydrolysis is K_h = 1/(Ksp * Kw^3). Because Kw is [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the K expressions.

Let me write the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 as:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq) ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The reverse reaction is:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq) ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) ; K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. Let me write this as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Which can be rewritten as:

Fe^3+ + 3H+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ + 3H2O.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to relate K_h to Ksp and Kw.

So, given that:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

For the reverse reaction (the hydrolysis of Fe^3+), the K is 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ (aq) + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+.

Which can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's omitted, so K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But how is this related to Ksp?

Well, Ksp is for the dissolution into Fe^3+ and OH^-.

So, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

If I take the hydrolysis reaction and reverse the dissolution:

Fe^3+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) ; K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis involves H+.

Let me think of the hydrolysis in terms of H+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Which can be rewritten as: Fe^3+ + 3H+ + 3OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3H2O.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the hydrolysis reaction in terms of the dissolution and the autoionization of water.

This is getting a bit complicated, perhaps I should find a different approach. Maybe I can find the pH using the formula for a weak acid solution.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis produces 'x' moles of H+ per liter.

So, [H+] = 3x (since each Fe^3+ gives 3 H+), and [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936 (since x is small compared to 0.00936).

The K for hydrolysis would be (3x)^3 / 0.00936 = K_h.

But I don't know K_h. Alternatively, I can find K_h using the Ksp and Kw.

Wait, I think K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Because, from the dissolution, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+], so Ksp = [Fe^3+][ (Kw / [H+] ) ]^3.

Rearranging, [Fe^3+] = Ksp * [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

So, [Fe^3+] = (Ksp / Kw^3) * [H+]^3.

But in the hydrolysis, [Fe^3+] is 0.00936, and [H+] is 3x.

So, 0.00936 = (Ksp / Kw^3) * (3x)^3.

Wait, but if I'm considering the hydrolysis, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+], so:

K_h = (3x)^3 / 0.00936.

But from the previous equation,

0.00936 = (Ksp / Kw^3) * (3x)^3 → (3x)^3 = 0.00936 * Kw^3 / Ksp.

Substituting into K_h:

K_h = (0.00936 * Kw^3 / Ksp) / 0.00936 → K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So, K_h = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 → (1e-42) / 6e-37 = approximately 1.666e-6.

So K_h ≈ 1.666e-5.

Wait, let me compute that again.

(1e-14)^3 is 1e-42.

6e-37 is Ksp.

So K_h = (1e-42) / (6e-37) ) = (1/6) * 1e-5 → approximately 1.6667e-6.

So K_h ≈ 1.6667e-6.

Now, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

We can set [H+] = 3x, and [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936.

So,

( (3x)^3 ) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 → (27x^3) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 → x^3 = (1.6667e-6 * 0.00936) ) / 27.

Calculate numerator: 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

Divide by 27: 1.56e-8 / 27 ≈ 5.78e-10.

So x^3 ≈ 5.78e-10 → x ≈ cube root(5.78e-10) ≈ 8.33e-4.

So [H+] = 3x ≈ 2.5e-3 M.

pH = -log10(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.60.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

2.5e-3 is 0.0025.

Log10(0.0025) = log(2.5e-3) = log(2.5) + log(1e-3) → 0.39794 + (-3) → -2.60206.

So pH is 2.60.

Looking at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³.

Option B is pH 2.69 and 30.09 cm³.

Wait, our calculation gives pH ≈ 2.60, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69, but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate K_h.

K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kw^3 = (1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp is given as 6e-37.

So K_h = 1e-42 / 6e-37 → (1/6) * 1e-5 → 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

So, [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → (3x)^3 = K_h * 0.00936 → 27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = approx 1.56e-8.

So x^3 = 1.56e-8 / 27 ≈ 5.78e-10 → x ≈ 8.33e-4.

So [H+] = 3x = 2.5e-3 → pH = 2.60.

Wait, but none of the options have pH 2.60. The closest is option B, pH 2.69, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to account for activity coefficients or more precise Ksp values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hydrolysis produces less H+ because the solution volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration is 0.00936 M, as calculated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Ostwald dilution law for the hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium expression is [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = K_h.

We have K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) = 1e-42 / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approximately 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → [H+] = cube_root( K_h * [Fe^3+] )

= cube_root( 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ) → cube_root( 1.56e-8 ) → approximately 2.49e-3 M.

pH = -log(2.49e-3) → log(2.49) is about 0.3969 → pH = 2.603.

So about 2.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K_h.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the hydrolysis is more significant, and [Fe^3+] is not approximately 0.00936.

Wait, let's try solving without making the approximation.

Let [H+] = 3x.

The equation is:

(3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x) ) = 1.6667e-6.

Expanding,

27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 (0.00936 - x )

→ 27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 - 1.6667e-6 x.

Compute 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8.

So,

27x^3 + 1.6667e-6 x - 1.56e-8 = 0.

This is a cubic equation. Let me try an approximate solution.

Assume x is much smaller than 0.00936, so 27x^3 ≈ 1.56e-8 → x^3 ≈ 5.77e-10 → x≈8.33e-4. So [H+] = 2.5e-3, as before.

But if x is not negligible, perhaps I should check.

Let me plug x=8.33e-4 into the equation.

27*(8.33e-4)^3 = 27*(5.78e-10) )=1.56e-8.

The term 1.6667e-6 * x = 1.6667e-6 * 8.33e-4 = approx 1.388e-9.

So equation becomes 1.56e-8 + 1.388e-9 ≈ 1.7e-8 on left side, which is bigger than 1.56e-8 on the right. So perhaps x is a bit smaller.

But this probably won't change the pH much. So I think our initial assumption is correct.

But looking at the options, the pH isn't matching. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the H+ needed for dissolving Fe(OH)3.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Each mole requires 3 moles H+ → 0.002808 mol H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 → 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³.

Which matches option C's volume of 28.05 cm³.

But according to our earlier calculation, the pH is about 2.60, but option C has pH 2.04. So that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Maybe the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is different.

Wait, I looked up that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-37, yes. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when Fe(OH)3 is added to the acid, the solution becomes a solution of Fe^3+ and excess H+.

Wait, wait a second. The initial reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

If we add exactly the amount of H+ needed, the solution would have [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M and [H+] from water only, which would be around pH 2.6.

But perhaps when you add a strong acid, the solution's H+ is mainly from the acid, not from the hydrolysis. Wait, but in this case, we're adding just enough H+ to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, so the only H+ comes from the acid and any hydrolysis.

Wait, wait! Oh, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved in the strong acid, the solution may have excess H+ from the acid. No, wait, no. Because the problem asks for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So, the acid's H+ is just enough to react with Fe(OH)3. So after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and any excess H+? No, wait, because we're adding the minimum volume, the H+ is exactly enough to react with Fe(OH)3, so there would be no excess H+.

Wait, wait a minute. When you add acid to dissolve the base, the acid is in stoichiometric amount, so the solution after reaction would have Fe^3+ and any H+ from water.

No, wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Because the acid is monobasic and strong, the reaction goes to completion. So all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and the solution has Fe^3+ and H+ from the acid in excess.

Wait, no, because the stoichiometric amount of acid is added. So after reaction, all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved into Fe^3+ and H2O. So the H+ comes from the acid: moles of H+ added is 0.002808 mol, which is 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3.

The volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so [H+] = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M.

But wait, no. Because the H+ comes from the acid, which is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. So after the reaction, the H+ concentration is 0.02808 M, but that's only the H+ from the acid. But wait, the Fe^3+ will hydrolyze to produce more H+.

So the H+ in solution is from two sources: the excess acid (but in this case, it's exactly the needed amount, so no excess) and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, no, because we're adding exactly the amount of acid needed to react with Fe(OH)3. So the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. So the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, that's a key point. So when you add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O goes to completion, and the resulting solution has Fe^3+ and water. The only H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the [H+] is determined by the hydrolysis.

But earlier, when I calculated the pH based on hydrolysis, I got about pH 2.60, which is close to option B, which has pH 2.69.

Wait, let me think again. The volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so total volume is 100 cm³.

So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is in 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and the H+ comes from that.

So going back to the K_h calculation.

We have K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e-8 → [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) ≈ 2.49e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.60.

But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise Ksp value. Let me look up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.0 × 10^-37 at 25°C.

So K_h = (1e-14)^3 / (6e-37) ) = (1e-42) / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct K_h is higher, which would lead to a higher [H+] and lower pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis produces more H+.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation without approximations.

Let me write the equation again:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M,

K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

So [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = 1.6667e-6 * 9.36e-3 → 1.6667e-6 * 9.36e-3 = 1.56e-8.

So [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) ≈ 2.49e-3 M.

So pH = -log(2.49e-3) → log(2.49) is about 0.3969 → pH = 2.603.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option B (pH 2.69) and option C (pH 2.04).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction. Maybe the reaction produces more H+ because of the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction releases 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

Wait, no, that's what I already considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis, but I'm miscalculating the K_h.

Another thought: maybe the K_h is calculated differently.

Wait, from Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We can write [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

Then, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3) ) ) = Kw^(1) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3) / (Ksp)^(1/3).

So [H+] = (Kw / Ksp )^(1/3) * [Fe^3+]^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14,

Ksp = 6e-37,

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = (1e-14 / 6e-37 )^(1/3) * (0.00936)^(1/3).

Calculate (1e-14 /6e-37) = (1/6) * 1e23 → approx 1.6667e22.

Cube root of 1.6667e22 → (1.6667e22)^(1/3) ≈ 2.58e7.

Cube root of 0.00936 → approx 0.21.

So,

[H+] ≈ 2.58e7 * 0.21 ≈ 5.42e6 M.

Wait, that can't be right because that would give a pH of about -6.7, which is impossible.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute (1e-14 /6e-37 ) = 1e-14 /6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e23 → 1.6667e22.

Cube root of 1.6667e22 is (1.6667e22)^(1/3) → Let's see, 1e22 is (1e7.333)^3 ≈ (1e7.333)^3 = 1e22.

So the cube root is approximately 2.58e7.

Then, [Fe^3+]^(1/3) = (0.00936)^(1/3) → 0.00936 is about 1e-2.027 → cube root is 1e-0.675 ≈ 0.21.

So [H+] = 2.58e7 * 0.21 ≈ 5.42e6 M. That's way too high, which can't be correct. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem using the hydrolysis expression correctly.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K_h is [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

We have K_h = 1.6667e-6.

So,

[H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] → [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-8.

So, [H+] = cube_root(1.56e-8) → approx 2.49e-3 → pH ≈ 2.60.

So I think our initial calculation is correct. But since none of the options match exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 1e-37, not 6e-37.

If Ksp = 1e-37, then K_h = (1e-14)^3 / 1e-37 = 1e-42 / 1e-37 = 1e-5.

Then, [H+]^3 = 1e-5 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-8.

So [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-8) ≈ 4.55e-3 → pH ≈ 2.34.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the acid is added, it contributes H+ which affects the pH.

Wait, but in the problem, we're adding the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the H+ comes from two sources: the acid and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, no, because the acid is added to exactly neutralize the Fe(OH)3. So all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, leaving only H+ from the hydrolysis.

So the pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis.

But according to our calculations, that's pH ~2.6.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B with pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But our calculation for the volume is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But why is the pH so low?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the solution after the reaction has excess H+ from the acid. No, because we added exactly the amount needed for neutralization, so there's no excess H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not 1:3 but something else. Let me recheck.

Fe(OH)3 has the formula Fe(OH)3, which is a base. When it reacts with a strong acid, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Yes, so 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid needed: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 28.08 cm³ → which is option C's volume.

But the pH in option C is 2.04, which is much lower than our calculation of ~2.6.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the Ksp value. Let me look up the exact Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, I find that the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-37, which matches what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the pH. Let me try a different approach.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me let x be the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts. Then,

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936.

[H+] = 3x.

The K_h expression is:

K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = (3x)^3 / 0.00936 = 27x^3 / 0.00936.

Set K_h = 1.6667e-6.

So,

27x^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-8.

x^3 = 5.78e-10 → x ≈ 8.33e-4.

[H+] = 3x = 2.5e-3 → pH = 2.60.

Still, no option matches. So perhaps there's an error in the K_h calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce OH- instead of H+.

But no, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so Fe^3+ should act as an acid, releasing H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the K_h is calculated differently. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should write the hydrolysis as Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

In that case, the stoichiometry is 1:1, and the K would be different.

But I'm not sure about that. Let me proceed.

If the reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+,

then K = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the Ksp.

Wait, Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-37.

Assuming that Fe(OH)^2+ is a step in the hydrolysis, perhaps the K for Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ can be found.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated, and I might be overcomplicating things.

Another thought: perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that can't be right because we've used exactly the needed amount of acid.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume. So when I added 28.08 cm³ of acid to 100 cm³ of solution, the total volume is 128.08 cm³. But the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps I should account for that.

Wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So if I add V cm³ of acid, then the total volume is 100 cm³.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. So the initial solution is perhaps 100 cm³, and adding V cm³ of acid would make the total volume 100 + V cm³. But the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps V is the volume of acid added, making the total volume 100 cm³.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me re-read the question.

The problem says: "We would like to dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume."

So the solution after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So when the acid is added, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So the acid's volume is part of this 100 cm³.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the solution already has some volume before adding the acid. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution made by dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So the initial volume (before adding acid) plus the acid volume equals 100 cm³.

But it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³, so the volume of acid added plus the volume of the solution (water) is 100 cm³.

But without knowing the initial volume of the solution, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume of acid added is negligible compared to 100 cm³, so the total volume remains approximately 100 cm³.

But regardless, the calculation for the moles of H+ needed is 0.002808 mol, and the volume of 0.1 M acid is 28.08 cm³.

So the answer is option C, which has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But according to my calculations, the pH is around 2.6, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But that would only be the case if the acid is in excess.

Wait, no, because we're adding the minimum amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation. Let me check again.

K_h = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Kw = 1e-14 → Kw^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp = 6e-37 → K_h = 1e-42 / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 → 1.6667e-6.

That's correct.

So, [H+] = cube_root( K_h * [Fe^3+] ) → cube_root(1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 ) → cube_root(1.56e-8) → 2.49e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, which has pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+.

Wait, 0.1 grams Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass: Fe = ~55.85 g/mol, O=16, H=1. So 55.85 + 3*(16+1) = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

Molar mass correct.

Moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³. So option C's volume is 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

But the pH is 2.60, not matching any option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the pH in the options is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation.

Wait, perhaps the solution also contains some OH- from water, but that's negligible compared to H+ from the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the H+ concentration includes both from the acid and the hydrolysis. But no, the acid is used up in the reaction.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid, but that would require adding more acid than needed.

But the problem states that we're adding the minimum amount needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so the H+ comes only from the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for a weak acid:

pH = ½ (pKa - log C)

Wait, but I don't know the pKa of the hydrolysis product. Alternatively, perhaps I can find pKa from K_h.

We have K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6.

If I treat this as K_a for a triprotic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each Fe^3+ contributes 3 H+, so the effective concentration is 3C, where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

So, [H+] = sqrt(3C * K_h).

Wait, perhaps that's another approach. Let me try.

Assume that each Fe^3+ releases 3 H+, so the concentration of H+ is 3√(C * K_h).

C is 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+] = 3√(0.00936 * 1.6667e-6 ) → 3√(1.56e-8 ) → 3 * 1.25e-4 → 3.75e-4.

pH = -log(3.75e-4 ) → log(3.75) is about 0.574 → pH = 3.426.

Still not matching any option.

This is getting frustrating. Perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion that the correct answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Wait, but according to my calculations, the pH should be around 2.6, but option C has pH 2.04. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps the K_h is 1e-5.

If K_h = 1e-5,

[H+]^3 = 1e-5 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-8 → [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-8) ≈ 4.55e-3 → pH ≈ 2.34.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the K_h is 1e-3.

Then [H+]^3 = 1e-3 * 0.00936 = 9.36e-6 → [H+] ≈ 2.1e-2 → pH ≈ 1.68.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But according to my calculations, the pH should be around 2.6, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K_h calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the exact expression without approximations.

Let me write the equation again:

[H+]^3 = K_h * [Fe^3+] = 1.6667e-6 * 0.00936 = 1.56e-8.

So,

[H+] = (1.56e-8 )^(1/3) ≈ 2.49e-3 → pH ≈ 2.60.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, and the pH in the options is rounded or calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the hydrolysis and only consider the H+ from the acid, which would give pH = 2.85 (from [H+] = 0.028 M), but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But no, because we've neutralized all the Fe(OH)3.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the calculations I did, which give volume 28.08 cm³ and pH 2.6. Since option C has 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, and option B has 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69, I think the correct answer is option C, and possibly the pH is miscalculated in the options. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the pH is calculated without considering the hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but let's see.

[H+] = 0.02808 M → pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55 → pH ≈ 1.55, which is not an option.

So, I think the correct answer is option C, 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. But I'm not confident about the pH part.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution and calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

### Step 1: Reaction and Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and a strong acid is:
\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]
- The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3 \times (16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
  \]
- The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
  \[
  \text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Moles of H⁺ Required
From the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of Acid Required
The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume of acid required is:
\[
\text{Volume of acid} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Concentration of acid}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: pH of the Resulting Solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which undergo hydrolysis:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this hydrolysis is related to the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3.
\]
Given \(K_{sp} = 6 \times 10^{-37}\) and \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\), the hydrolysis constant (\(K_h\)) is:
\[
K_h = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-37}} = 1.6667 \times 10^{-6}.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the solution is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the hydrolysis equilibrium:
\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]},
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K_h \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.6667 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (0.00936) = 1.56 \times 10^{-8}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = \sqrt[3]{1.56 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 2.49 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(2.49 \times 10^{-3})} \approx 2.60.
\]

### Step 5: Matching with Options
- The calculated volume of acid is approximately \(28.08 \, \text{cm}^3\), which matches closely with option C (\(28.05 \, \text{cm}^3\)).
- The calculated pH is approximately \(2.60\), but none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is B (\(\text{pH} = 2.69\)).

Given the calculations, the correct answer is **option C**, as it provides the closest volume to the calculated value, even though the pH in the options does not perfectly align with the calculated value.

Answer: C
