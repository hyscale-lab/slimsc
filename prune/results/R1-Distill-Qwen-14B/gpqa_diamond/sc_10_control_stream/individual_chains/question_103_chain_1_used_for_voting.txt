Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ethanone part is a two-carbon ketone, right? That means the carbonyl group (C=O) is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO? No, wait, ethan-1-one is acetone: (CH3)2CO. Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is where the carbonyl is at position 1. So structure-wise, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the substituent is attached to the methyl groups. Wait, no, in the compound, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has a group that's connected to the ketone. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent that's a ketone (O=C-) attached to a CH2 group, but wait, no: wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one part is the ketone. So the substituent is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is: a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to a CH3 group on each side? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Ethane has two carbons. 1-ketone would be: O=C-CH3, but wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but if it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, then the substituent is at the 1 position of ethanone. So the molecule is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is in position 1 of ethane. So, structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro), and attached to the 1 position of ethanone. So the phenyl group is attached to a carbonyl group, which is connected to a methyl group. Wait, no: ethanone is (CH3)2CO, but perhaps in this case, the phenyl is attached directly to the carbonyl. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group.

So, to make this molecule, I need to start with benzene and add substituents in the correct positions. Let's think about the substituents: bromine at position 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone (acetyl group) at position 1? Wait, no: the substituents on the benzene are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, and the ketone is attached to the benzene ring via a single bond. So the positions are 3 and 5 relative to where the acetyl group is attached.

Wait, the way the naming works is that the substituents on the benzene are numbered relative to the point of attachment of the acetyl group. So the acetyl group is at position 1. Then, bromine is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (acetyl group), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

So, the plan is to add these groups to benzene in such a way that the directing effects of each group are considered. Because the order of adding substituents will determine where each new group attaches.

Let me think about the synthetic steps. The target molecule has three substituents: Br, NO2, and the acetyl group.

But wait, benzene is planar, so the positions are relative. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away), and nitro at position 5 (four away? Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 would all be meta to each other. So perhaps the substituents are in a meta arrangement.

Wait, but if I start with benzene and add the acetyl group first, then the next substituents will be directed by that. The acetyl group is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). So when I add the next group, say nitro, it would go meta to the acetyl group.

But let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. The acetyl group (COCH3) is an EWG, so it's meta-directing. Nitro groups are also EWGs, so meta-directing. Br is slightly deactivating and ortho/para-directing because it's an EWG but can also have some resonance effects.

Wait, but I need to introduce both Br and nitro groups. Hmm.

Let me plan out the steps. Starting with benzene.

First, perhaps I should add the acetyl group. Because if I add other groups first, they might interfere with the acetylation.

Wait, but acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Wait, no: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to benzene. Benzene is reactive enough for that. So step one could be Friedel-Crafts acylation: adding the acetyl group.

So first, benzene undergoes acylation with CH3COCl and AlCl3 as catalyst. That would give acetophenone, the benzene with an acetyl group at position 1.

Then, next step is to add nitro groups and bromine. But wait, the target has two substituents besides the acetyl group: Br and nitro.

But wait, in the target, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So let me think about how to get that.

After adding the acetyl group, the next substituent would be directed by the acetyl group. Since acetyl is meta-directing, any new substituent would go meta to it.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the Br is at position 3 and the nitro at 5, relative to the acetyl at position 1. So if I add the nitro group next, it would go meta to the acetyl, which would be position 3. But wait, that's where the Br is in the target. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add the Br first, then the nitro, but considering the directing effects.

Wait, let me think again about the order of adding substituents. Because the substituents added later are directed by the existing groups.

Option 1: Add acetyl first (since it's a strong EWG and meta-directing). Then, add nitro group in the meta position of acetyl. Then, add Br in the para position of nitro, which would be the meta position of acetyl? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added last. Because if I add nitro and Br first, perhaps their directing effects would allow for the acetyl to be added in the correct position.

But wait, nitro is a strong meta director, and Br is a para/ortho director.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group should be added first. Let me think: if I nitrate benzene, the nitro group is para to the acetyl if the acetyl is added later. Hmm, but the acetyl is a meta director, so if I add it after nitro, perhaps...

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan the steps in the order of the options given. Let me look at the options.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation); ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iv) Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?); v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let me think about the steps in Option A:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene becomes acetophenone.

2. Br2/FeBr3: this would be bromination. But acetophenone is meta directing, so the Br would add meta to the acetyl group. So acetophenone with Br at position 3.

3. HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Now, the directing groups are acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). The acetyl is the stronger director (since nitro groups are strong, but Br is less activating). Wait, but nitration is a strong reaction. In acetophenone, the acetyl is deactivating and meta-directing. So when nitrating, the incoming nitro group would be directed meta to the acetyl. But after adding Br, the substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (position 3), and now adding nitro. Hmm, but the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3. Where would nitro go?

Wait, with multiple substituents, the directing depends on the most powerful director. Acetyl is a strong meta director. Nitration is a strong reaction, so perhaps the nitro group would go meta to the acetyl, which is position 5? Because position 3 is already taken by Br. So the nitro would be at position 5. So after step iii, we'd have acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Wait, but that's our target! Then, why are there more steps?

Because in option A, after step iii, steps iv and v are done. Step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reduction. But wait, Fe/HCl is typically for hydrolysis, perhaps for nitro groups. Wait, maybe it's a reduction of nitro to amine. But if we have a nitro group, perhaps we don't want that. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, target has nitro group, Br, and acetyl. So perhaps in option A, after steps i, ii, iii, we have all three substituents. But step iv says Fe/HCl, which is for nitro group reduction to amine. But in our target, the nitro is present. So that would be a problem. So option A might not be the right one.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

So step 1: bromination of benzene. Benzene becomes bromobenzene.

Step 2: nitration. Br is a para/ortho director. So nitro would go para to Br, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So after nitration, meta to Br? Wait, no, Br is ortho/para directing. So nitro will go either para or ortho to Br. Let's say para, so nitro at position 4 relative to Br.

Now, step 3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed easily because the ring is deactivated. Acylation typically requires an activating group. So if we've already added Br, which is deactivating, the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So Friedel-Crafts may not work; it could fail. So option B might have a problem in step iii.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, step i: nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl. Hmm, this is a reducing condition. Fe and HCl is typically for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene would become phenylamine. But phenylamine is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, with phenylamine, which is activating, the acetyl would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. But then, step iv is Br2/FeBr3, which would add Br in the ortho/para positions relative to the existing groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the target structure again. After all, the target has nitro, Br, and acetyl groups in specific positions.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Step i: nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine, so we have aniline.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl is a diazotization condition, but without a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's forming a diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 is for the hydrolysis of diazonium salts. Wait, H3PO2 (phosphorus acid) is typically used in the Sandmeyer reaction to introduce Cl, Br, etc. But without a copper catalyst, maybe it's for hydrolysis. Wait, maybe the diazonium is being decomposed under these conditions, perhaps removing the amino group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not the correct option because introducing Br and acetyl in certain steps might not align with the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the correct order of adding substituents. Let's think about the directing effects and how each step would influence where the new group is added.

The target has three substituents: Br, nitro, and acetyl. The acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So, to get the substituents in the correct positions, perhaps the acetyl should be added first because it's a strong meta director. Then, the nitro group would be added meta to the acetyl (position 5), and the Br would be added meta to the nitro (position 1 +3?), but wait, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group should be added first, then Br, then acetyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, add nitro group in the meta position of acetyl.

3. Then, add Br in the meta position of nitro, which would be ortho to the acetyl.

Wait, but the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5 relative to acetyl at 1. So, if acetyl is at 1, nitro would go to 4, but that's not the case. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added after nitro and Br, but that's tricky since Friedel-Crafts needs an activated ring. If the ring is deactivated by nitro and Br, it's hard to add acetyl.

Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group. So if the ring is deactivated, it won't proceed. So if you have nitro groups (deactivating) on the ring, you can't do Friedel-Crafts anymore.

So maybe the acetyl group must be added before any deactivating groups like nitro or Br.

Thus, the acetyl should be added first. Then, nitro and Br in positions directed by the acetyl.

So, step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) to get acetophenone.

Step 2: Now, nitrate acetophenone. Since acetyl is meta-directing, nitro would go to position 4, which is meta to the acetyl (position 1). But in the target, nitro is at position 5. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, let's number the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, the positions adjacent are 2 and 6 (ortho), 3 and 5 (meta), and 4 (para).

So, after adding nitro, where would it go? It would be meta to the acetyl, which would be position 4? Wait, no: if the acetyl is at position 1, meta would be positions 3 and 5.

Wait, no. The meta positions to position 1 are positions 3 and 5.

So, when adding nitro, which is directed by the acetyl (meta), it would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say it goes to position 3. Then, where would Br go? It would be directed by the nitro group (since it's a meta director as well), but wait, Br is actually an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. So, if nitro is at position 3, and the acetyl at 1, then the Br would go ortho to nitro, which is position 2 or 4. But in the target, the Br is at position 3. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetyl is added, we brominate. Since acetyl is meta-directing, Br would add at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, when we nitrate, the acetyl is meta-directing, so nitro would go to position 5. That would give us acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Which is exactly the target.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromination: adds Br at position 3.

3. Nitration: adds nitro at position 5.

Wait, but after adding Br, when we nitrate, the substituents present are acetyl (1) and Br (3). So the directing would be a combination of both. Which group is more directive?

Wait, acetyl is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Br is a deactivating (but less than acetyl?), but ortho/para-directing. So in the presence of both, which group directs the incoming nitro group?

I think the strongest director would take precedence. Acetyl is a strong meta director. So nitration would occur meta to the acetyl. So, position 5 would be meta to 1, so nitro goes to 5. That fits our target.

So then, the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation.

ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3), which adds Br in meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), which adds nitro in meta to acetyl (position 5).

But wait, looking at the options, does any option follow this sequence?

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3; iii) CH3COCl.

Wait, that's adding Br first, then nitro, then acetyl. But after adding nitro and Br, adding acetyl may not be possible because the ring is deactivated.

So option B is not correct.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2; iii) HNO3.

So steps: acetyl, Br, nitro. Which would give the desired structure. So after step iii, we'd have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's the target. So why are there more steps? Because option A continues with steps iv to vii.

Wait, step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent. Fe/HCl is used to reduce nitro groups to amines. But in our target, we have nitro, so this step would be a problem. So option A would lead to amine instead of nitro.

So that's not good. So option A's steps are:

i) acetyl,

ii) Br,

iii) nitro,

iv) Fe/HCl (so nitro becomes NH2),

v) HNO3 again (adds another nitro? But where?)

vi) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization),

vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, but this seems to be going off track. So option A isn't working.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3 (nitration),

ii) Fe/HCl (reduce to amine),

iii) CH3COCl (acetylation? But with amine present, which is activating. So acetyl would go ortho or para to the amine.

iv) Br2 (bromination, which is now directed by acetyl and amine? Not sure.

But after step iii, if we have an acetyl group, which is a meta director, and the amine (from nitro reduction) is an ortho/para director. So the Br would likely go ortho or para to the amine, which is at position where the nitro was. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Option D: steps i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), iii) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), iv) H3PO2 (maybe decomposition of diazonium to form a hole?), v) Br2 (bromine addition), vi) CH3COCl (acetylation), vii) nitration again.

But after step ii, we have aniline. Step iii would form a diazonium salt. Step iv is H3PO2, which is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts to produce phenols. So step iv would convert the diazonium into a phenol group (-OH). Then, step v is Br2/FeBr3, which would brominate the phenol? But phenol is a strong activating group, so bromine would add ortho or para. Then, step vi is acetylation (Friedel-Crafts), which requires an activated ring. But if we have Br and OH groups, which are deactivating, Friedel-Crafts might not work. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add nitro groups, then Br, but that doesn't make sense because acetylation requires an activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl) to get aniline.

3. Acetylate: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is activating, so acetyl would add in ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but the target has acetyl in position 1, nitro in 5, Br in 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the target has acetophenone as the main group, perhaps the acetyl should be added first.

So:

1. Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Bromination: adds Br meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Nitration: adds nitro meta to acetyl (position 5).

So the three substituents are at 1,3,5.

But in the options, none of the options A to D have only these three steps. So perhaps the options include more steps, but some are unnecessary or perhaps involve other functional groups that are later modified.

Wait, looking at option B:

i) Br2 (adds Br),

ii) HNO3 (adds nitro),

iii) CH3COCl (adds acetyl).

But Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. After adding Br and nitro, the ring is deactivated, so step iii might not work. So that's a problem.

Option C:

i) HNO3 (nitro),

ii) Fe/HCl (reduce to amine),

iii) CH3COCl (acetyl),

iv) Br2,

v) HNO3,

vi) NaNO2,

vii) H3PO2.

But Friedel-Crafts after adding amine? Aniline is activating, so acetylation is possible.

So step i: nitro at position 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: acetylate. Since amine is activating, acetyl would go ortho or para to amine (which is position 1). So acetyl at position 3 or 5.

Wait, but the target has acetyl at 1, but in this case, the amine is at 1. So perhaps the acetyl would go to position 3.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Let's think about the target molecule. It has three substituents on the benzene ring: acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So perhaps in the correct sequence, the acetyl is added first, then Br, then nitro.

Which brings me back to option A: i) acetyl, ii) Br, iii) nitro. But then the problem is that option A has additional steps which would modify the nitro group, which we don't want.

Wait, what's the purpose of the other steps in the options?

Looking at option A, after steps i, ii, iii, the molecule has acetyl, Br, and nitro. So that's the target. But the option continues, so steps iv to vii are applied, which would change things.

So perhaps none of the options A-D directly produce the target in steps i-iii, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the target also has an ethan-1-one structure, which is the acetyl group. So the correct substituents are present, but perhaps the other steps in the options are introducing and then removing other groups.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is adding the nitro group first, then the acetyl, then bromine.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. If nitro is present, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts may not work. So perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding the acetyl, then nitro, then bromine, but then the nitro is reduced and then added again? That seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's try to think through option C's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl) → aniline.

iii) Acetylate using CH3COCl → acetophenone derivative. Wait, but aniline is at position 1. So acetylation would add acetyl in ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) relative to the amine.

Hmm, but in the target, the acetyl is at position 1. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iii, the acetyl is at position 3 relative to the amine at position 1. Then, step iv is Br2, which would be directed by the acetyl (now at 3) and the amine at 1.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by elimination.

The target has nitro, Br, and acetyl in a meta arrangement. To get this, the acetyl must be added first because it's a strong deactivating group that requires an active ring for its own addition.

Looking for the option that starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Only option A starts with acylation (step i), followed by bromination (step ii), then nitration (step iii). So after these three steps, we have the three substituents in correct positions.

But option A has more steps after that, which would interfere. So why are there more steps? Maybe those steps are to modify other functional groups.

Wait, maybe the steps after are for installing or eliminating other groups. Let's think: after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target structure. But then, what happens in steps iv and beyond?

Step iv: Fe/HCl. Fe and HCl is for reducing nitro groups to amines. But in the target, we have nitro, so this step would change it. That's not desired.

So perhaps the correct sequence isn't in the options as is, but perhaps the correct option is another.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step in the options.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. Since amine is activating, acetyl would add ortho or para to amine. So, acetyl at 3 or 5.

iv) Br2 → bromination directed by acetyl (meta) and amine (ortho/para). If acetyl is at 3, then Br would be at position 5 (meta to acetyl) or position 2 (ortho to acetyl, but that's meta to amine).

Wait, maybe Br adds at position 5.

v) HNO3 → nitration. The ring has substituents at 1 (amine), 3 (acetyl), and 5 (Br). So, the next nitration would be directed by the strongest director. Acetyl is a strong meta director. So nitro would go meta to acetyl, which is position 6 or 2. But position 2 is adjacent to amine (position 1), which is ortho/para director, but maybe the acetyl is stronger.

Alternatively, the acetyl directs the nitro to position 6, but position 5 is already occupied by Br.

Hmm, not sure.

But this seems to be getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should focus on the correct order of substituent addition.

The correct order is:

1. Acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromine via FeBr3 (meta direction).

3. Nitro via HNO3 (meta direction).

So the correct option would have these three steps in this order.

Looking at the options, option A does this, but then continues with other steps which would alter the structure.

So why are the options having more steps? Because perhaps some steps are for protection or for activating certain positions.

Wait, perhaps the additional steps are for installing and then removing certain groups. Wait, like in some cases, you might need to protect a group before adding another.

Wait, but the target doesn't have any other groups; it's just the three substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are for installing and then reactivating the ring. For example, sometimes you need to reduce a nitro group to an amine to make the ring more reactive again.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is present, so any reduction steps would be bad.

Wait, perhaps the options involve steps that mistakenly add and remove groups, but the correct option is the one where the substituents are added in the correct order without altering any after.

But in the options, all of them have more than three steps. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, let me think again.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce to amine (Fe/HCl) → amine at 1.

iii) Acetylation → acetyl at position 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Bromination → Br at position 5 (meta to acetyl, which is at 3).

Wait, that would give acetyl at 3, Br at 5, nitro at 1. Hmm, but the target has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added at position 5, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct. Let's think:

Option B:

i) Br2 → Br at position 1.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at position 4 (para to Br).

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl. But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hence, this step fails.

So option B isn't correct.

So perhaps the only option that starts with acetylation, followed by bromination, then nitration is option A. But in option A, after the initial three steps, step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce nitro to amine. That would change the structure, which we don't want.

Unless, perhaps, steps iv to vii are for removing some other groups. Wait, perhaps the steps are adding multiple groups, but only the final steps give the target structure.

Wait, maybe the initial steps in option A lead to the target, but the rest of the steps are for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl at 3 or 5 (ortho/para to amine).

iv) Br2 → Br at position 5 (meta to acetyl at 3) or position 2 (ortho to acetyl).

v) HNO3 → nitro at some position, but where?

But this seems to be adding and removing substituents, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to OH group.

Now, structure has OH at 1.

v) Br2 → Br adds ortho or para to OH (positions 2,4,6).

vi) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts acylation. OH is activating, so acetyl would add ortho or para to OH.

Assuming OH is at 1, acetyl could be at 3 or 5.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (OH), 3 (acetyl), and v?) Where would the nitro go?

But this seems to be a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps this is not the correct approach, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to think about the correct order again. The target has three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro.

The acetyl must be first because it's a strong deactivator, and Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So:

Step 1: Acetophenone.

Step 2: Bromination → Br at position 3.

Step 3: Nitration → nitro at position 5.

So, the correct sequence is i) acetyl, ii) Br, iii) nitro.

Looking for an option that has this sequence. Option A has this (i, ii, iii), but then continues with steps iv to vii.

But why are those steps necessary? Because the target is achieved after step iii. So perhaps the option is wrong because it includes unnecessary steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the subsequent steps are for another purpose. Wait, perhaps the nitro group was added in a different position and needs to be moved.

Wait, perhaps after adding nitro, another nitration is done, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii) in option A are for introducing and then removing some other functional groups. For example, perhaps the Fe/HCl is for reducing nitro to amine, but that's not desired.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck and should make a decision.

Based on the earlier analysis, the correct sequence is acetyl first, then Br, then nitro. So the option that starts with Friedel-Crafts, then bromination, then nitration is option A.

But option A's steps iv to vii might be extraneous, but perhaps they are part of a larger synthesis. Wait, perhaps the steps are for installing and then activating the ring again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not certain. I'm a bit confused because the initial three steps in option A would give the target, but the other steps would alter it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration step in option A. After adding acetyl and Br, would the nitration add the nitro group in the correct position?

In acetophenone, the acetyl is meta-directing. With Br already at position 3, when nitration occurs, the incoming nitro would be directed by the acetyl, which is stronger, so it would go to position 5. So after step iii, the target is achieved.

Then, steps iv to vii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium.

Hmm, but this seems to be altering the nitro group, which we don't want. So the target would be destroyed in steps iv.

So that can't be correct. So perhaps option A isn't the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let me check option D again.

Option D: steps i to iii:

i) nitro,

ii) Fe/HCl → amine,

iii) NaNO2 → diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to OH.

v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

Wait, after step iv, the structure is phenol (OH at position 1). Then, bromination would add Br ortho or para to OH, which are positions 2,4, or 6.

Then, acetylation would add acetyl ortho or para to OH. Suppose acetyl is added at position 3. Then, nitration would be directed by acetyl (meta) and OH (ortho/para). But I'm not sure.

This seems convoluted and doesn't lead directly to the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl at position 3 (meta to amine, which is at 1).

iv) Br2 → Br would add meta to acetyl (position 6), or ortho to amine (position 2). But acetyl is stronger.

v) HNO3 → nitration. Now, substituents are nitro at 1, acetyl at 3, Br at 6. Where would another nitro go? Maybe position 5, meta to acetyl.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the new nitro group? Not sure.

vii) H3PO2 → hydrolysis.

But this seems to be adding more groups and complicating the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of these, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of substituents. The target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl, Br, nitro.

So, each of the options must have three substitution steps. Let's see:

Option A: steps i, ii, iii add three groups (acetyl, Br, nitro). Then, steps iv-vii modify.

Option B: steps i adds Br, step ii adds nitro, step iii adds acetyl. But acetyl won't add as the ring is deactivated.

Option C: steps i adds nitro, step ii reduces to amine, step iii adds acetyl, step iv adds Br, step v adds another nitro. So now, four substituents? That's more than target.

Option D: steps i adds nitro, step ii reduces, step iii makes diazonium, step iv adds OH, step v adds Br, step vi adds acetyl, step vii adds nitro again. So target would have four substituents, which is not correct.

So, only option A's first three steps add the correct substituents. But the problem is steps iv and beyond.

Wait, perhaps the steps iv to vii in option A are for introducing and then removing a nitro group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option A, even though it has extra steps. Maybe the question is considering only the initial three steps, but that's not how the options are presented.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think about the possibility of using directing groups and activating/deactivating effects.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl group can be introduced after nitro and Br have been added. But the ring would be deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, but that would require the ring to be activated, which isn't possible after adding Br and acetyl.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct sequence is acetyl first, then Br, then nitro. The only option that does this is option A. But option A's steps iv to vii alter the structure, which we don't want. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group in option A is not in the correct position. Let me think again.

After adding acetyl (1), Br (3), and nitro (5), the structure is correct. So the first three steps in option A produce the target. But the option has more steps, which suggests that perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are for another purpose, such as protecting groups. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Since all the options seem to have more steps than needed, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are added in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully considered, as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like acetyl and nitro are meta-directing, while bromine, being a halogen, is ortho/para-directing.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine meta to the acetyl group, resulting in bromine at position 3.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group meta to the acetyl group, resulting in nitro at position 5. At this point, the target molecule is achieved.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl (reduction), HNO₃ (nitration), NaNO₂/HCl (diazotization), and H₃PO₂ (hydrolysis). These additional steps are unnecessary and would alter the target structure, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group para to bromine, resulting in nitro at position 4.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation attempts to add the acetyl group. However, the ring is now deactivated due to the presence of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed. This option fails.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group ortho or para to the amine. Assuming acetyl is added at position 3, the structure now has amine at 1 and acetyl at 3.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine meta to the acetyl group, resulting in bromine at position 6.
5. **Step v**: Nitration adds another nitro group, which would interfere with the target structure.
6. **Steps vi–vii**: Diazotization and hydrolysis further complicate the structure. This option does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Hydrolysis with H₃PO₂ converts the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination adds bromine ortho or para to the hydroxyl group, resulting in bromine at position 2 or 4.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group ortho or para to the hydroxyl group.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration adds another nitro group, which would interfere with the target structure. This option does not lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions must first introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration to achieve the correct substituent positions. Option A is the only one that follows this sequence in the first three steps. However, the additional steps in Option A (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the target structure. Despite this, Option A is the closest to the correct synthesis pathway.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ethanone part is a two-carbon ketone, right? That means the carbonyl group (C=O) is attached to a CH2 group. Wait, no, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO? No, wait, ethan-1-one is acetone: (CH3)2CO. Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is where the carbonyl is at position 1. So structure-wise, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO. So the substituent is attached to the methyl groups. Wait, no, in the compound, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has a group that's connected to the ketone. So the structure would be benzene with a substituent that's a ketone (O=C-) attached to a CH2 group, but wait, no: wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one part is the ketone. So the substituent is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is: a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to a CH3 group on each side? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Ethane has two carbons. 1-ketone would be: O=C-CH3, but wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but if it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, then the substituent is at the 1 position of ethanone. So the molecule is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to the carbonyl carbon, which is in position 1 of ethane. So, structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro), and attached to the 1 position of ethanone. So the phenyl group is attached to a carbonyl group, which is connected to a methyl group. Wait, no: ethanone is (CH3)2CO, but perhaps in this case, the phenyl is attached directly to the carbonyl. So the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3, where Ph is the 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl group.

So, to make this molecule, I need to start with benzene and add substituents in the correct positions. Let's think about the substituents: bromine at position 3, nitro at 5, and the ketone (acetyl group) at position 1? Wait, no: the substituents on the benzene are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, and the ketone is attached to the benzene ring via a single bond. So the positions are 3 and 5 relative to where the acetyl group is attached.

Wait, the way the naming works is that the substituents on the benzene are numbered relative to the point of attachment of the acetyl group. So the acetyl group is at position 1. Then, bromine is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (acetyl group), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

So, the plan is to add these groups to benzene in such a way that the directing effects of each group are considered. Because the order of adding substituents will determine where each new group attaches.

Let me think about the synthetic steps. The target molecule has three substituents: Br, NO2, and the acetyl group.

But wait, benzene is planar, so the positions are relative. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away), and nitro at position 5 (four away? Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 would all be meta to each other. So perhaps the substituents are in a meta arrangement.

Wait, but if I start with benzene and add the acetyl group first, then the next substituents will be directed by that. The acetyl group is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). So when I add the next group, say nitro, it would go meta to the acetyl group.

But let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. The acetyl group (COCH3) is an EWG, so it's meta-directing. Nitro groups are also EWGs, so meta-directing. Br is slightly deactivating and ortho/para-directing because it's an EWG but can also have some resonance effects.

Wait, but I need to introduce both Br and nitro groups. Hmm.

Let me plan out the steps. Starting with benzene.

First, perhaps I should add the acetyl group. Because if I add other groups first, they might interfere with the acetylation.

Wait, but acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. Wait, no: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to benzene. Benzene is reactive enough for that. So step one could be Friedel-Crafts acylation: adding the acetyl group.

So first, benzene undergoes acylation with CH3COCl and AlCl3 as catalyst. That would give acetophenone, the benzene with an acetyl group at position 1.

Then, next step is to add nitro groups and bromine. But wait, the target has two substituents besides the acetyl group: Br and nitro.

But wait, in the target, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So let me think about how to get that.

After adding the acetyl group, the next substituent would be directed by the acetyl group. Since acetyl is meta-directing, any new substituent would go meta to it.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the Br is at position 3 and the nitro at 5, relative to the acetyl at position 1. So if I add the nitro group next, it would go meta to the acetyl, which would be position 3. But wait, that's where the Br is in the target. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add the Br first, then the nitro, but considering the directing effects.

Wait, let me think again about the order of adding substituents. Because the substituents added later are directed by the existing groups.

Option 1: Add acetyl first (since it's a strong EWG and meta-directing). Then, add nitro group in the meta position of acetyl. Then, add Br in the para position of nitro, which would be the meta position of acetyl? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added last. Because if I add nitro and Br first, perhaps their directing effects would allow for the acetyl to be added in the correct position.

But wait, nitro is a strong meta director, and Br is a para/ortho director.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group should be added first. Let me think: if I nitrate benzene, the nitro group is para to the acetyl if the acetyl is added later. Hmm, but the acetyl is a meta director, so if I add it after nitro, perhaps...

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan the steps in the order of the options given. Let me look at the options.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation); ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination); iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration); iv) Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?); v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, let me think about the steps in Option A:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene becomes acetophenone.

2. Br2/FeBr3: this would be bromination. But acetophenone is meta directing, so the Br would add meta to the acetyl group. So acetophenone with Br at position 3.

3. HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. Now, the directing groups are acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). The acetyl is the stronger director (since nitro groups are strong, but Br is less activating). Wait, but nitration is a strong reaction. In acetophenone, the acetyl is deactivating and meta-directing. So when nitrating, the incoming nitro group would be directed meta to the acetyl. But after adding Br, the substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (position 3), and now adding nitro. Hmm, but the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3. Where would nitro go?

Wait, with multiple substituents, the directing depends on the most powerful director. Acetyl is a strong meta director. Nitration is a strong reaction, so perhaps the nitro group would go meta to the acetyl, which is position 5? Because position 3 is already taken by Br. So the nitro would be at position 5. So after step iii, we'd have acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Wait, but that's our target! Then, why are there more steps?

Because in option A, after step iii, steps iv and v are done. Step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reduction. But wait, Fe/HCl is typically for hydrolysis, perhaps for nitro groups. Wait, maybe it's a reduction of nitro to amine. But if we have a nitro group, perhaps we don't want that. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, target has nitro group, Br, and acetyl. So perhaps in option A, after steps i, ii, iii, we have all three substituents. But step iv says Fe/HCl, which is for nitro group reduction to amine. But in our target, the nitro is present. So that would be a problem. So option A might not be the right one.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

So step 1: bromination of benzene. Benzene becomes bromobenzene.

Step 2: nitration. Br is a para/ortho director. So nitro would go para to Br, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So after nitration, meta to Br? Wait, no, Br is ortho/para directing. So nitro will go either para or ortho to Br. Let's say para, so nitro at position 4 relative to Br.

Now, step 3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, bromobenzene is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed easily because the ring is deactivated. Acylation typically requires an activating group. So if we've already added Br, which is deactivating, the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So Friedel-Crafts may not work; it could fail. So option B might have a problem in step iii.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, step i: nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl. Hmm, this is a reducing condition. Fe and HCl is typically for the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So nitrobenzene would become phenylamine. But phenylamine is an activating group, so it's ortho/para directing.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, with phenylamine, which is activating, the acetyl would add in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. But then, step iv is Br2/FeBr3, which would add Br in the ortho/para positions relative to the existing groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the target structure again. After all, the target has nitro, Br, and acetyl groups in specific positions.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Step i: nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine, so we have aniline.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl is a diazotization condition, but without a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's forming a diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 is for the hydrolysis of diazonium salts. Wait, H3PO2 (phosphorus acid) is typically used in the Sandmeyer reaction to introduce Cl, Br, etc. But without a copper catalyst, maybe it's for hydrolysis. Wait, maybe the diazonium is being decomposed under these conditions, perhaps removing the amino group. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps D is not the correct option because introducing Br and acetyl in certain steps might not align with the target structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the correct order of adding substituents. Let's think about the directing effects and how each step would influence where the new group is added.

The target has three substituents: Br, nitro, and acetyl. The acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So, to get the substituents in the correct positions, perhaps the acetyl should be added first because it's a strong meta director. Then, the nitro group would be added meta to the acetyl (position 5), and the Br would be added meta to the nitro (position 1 +3?), but wait, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group should be added first, then Br, then acetyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then, add nitro group in the meta position of acetyl.

3. Then, add Br in the meta position of nitro, which would be ortho to the acetyl.

Wait, but the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5 relative to acetyl at 1. So, if acetyl is at 1, nitro would go to 4, but that's not the case. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is added after nitro and Br, but that's tricky since Friedel-Crafts needs an activated ring. If the ring is deactivated by nitro and Br, it's hard to add acetyl.

Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group. So if the ring is deactivated, it won't proceed. So if you have nitro groups (deactivating) on the ring, you can't do Friedel-Crafts anymore.

So maybe the acetyl group must be added before any deactivating groups like nitro or Br.

Thus, the acetyl should be added first. Then, nitro and Br in positions directed by the acetyl.

So, step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) to get acetophenone.

Step 2: Now, nitrate acetophenone. Since acetyl is meta-directing, nitro would go to position 4, which is meta to the acetyl (position 1). But in the target, nitro is at position 5. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, let's number the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, the positions adjacent are 2 and 6 (ortho), 3 and 5 (meta), and 4 (para).

So, after adding nitro, where would it go? It would be meta to the acetyl, which would be position 4? Wait, no: if the acetyl is at position 1, meta would be positions 3 and 5.

Wait, no. The meta positions to position 1 are positions 3 and 5.

So, when adding nitro, which is directed by the acetyl (meta), it would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say it goes to position 3. Then, where would Br go? It would be directed by the nitro group (since it's a meta director as well), but wait, Br is actually an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. So, if nitro is at position 3, and the acetyl at 1, then the Br would go ortho to nitro, which is position 2 or 4. But in the target, the Br is at position 3. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after acetyl is added, we brominate. Since acetyl is meta-directing, Br would add at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, when we nitrate, the acetyl is meta-directing, so nitro would go to position 5. That would give us acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Which is exactly the target.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromination: adds Br at position 3.

3. Nitration: adds nitro at position 5.

Wait, but after adding Br, when we nitrate, the substituents present are acetyl (1) and Br (3). So the directing would be a combination of both. Which group is more directive?

Wait, acetyl is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Br is a deactivating (but less than acetyl?), but ortho/para-directing. So in the presence of both, which group directs the incoming nitro group?

I think the strongest director would take precedence. Acetyl is a strong meta director. So nitration would occur meta to the acetyl. So, position 5 would be meta to 1, so nitro goes to 5. That fits our target.

So then, the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation.

ii) Bromination (Br2/FeBr3), which adds Br in meta to acetyl (position 3).

iii) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), which adds nitro in meta to acetyl (position 5).

But wait, looking at the options, does any option follow this sequence?

Looking at option B: i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3; iii) CH3COCl.

Wait, that's adding Br first, then nitro, then acetyl. But after adding nitro and Br, adding acetyl may not be possible because the ring is deactivated.

So option B is not correct.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2; iii) HNO3.

So steps: acetyl, Br, nitro. Which would give the desired structure. So after step iii, we'd have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). That's the target. So why are there more steps? Because option A continues with steps iv to vii.

Wait, step iv is Fe/HCl, which is a reducing agent. Fe/HCl is used to reduce nitro groups to amines. But in our target, we have nitro, so this step would be a problem. So option A would lead to amine instead of nitro.

So that's not good. So option A's steps are:

i) acetyl,

ii) Br,

iii) nitro,

iv) Fe/HCl (so nitro becomes NH2),

v) HNO3 again (adds another nitro? But where?)

vi) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization),

vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, but this seems to be going off track. So option A isn't working.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3 (nitration),

ii) Fe/HCl (reduce to amine),

iii) CH3COCl (acetylation? But with amine present, which is activating. So acetyl would go ortho or para to the amine.

iv) Br2 (bromination, which is now directed by acetyl and amine? Not sure.

But after step iii, if we have an acetyl group, which is a meta director, and the amine (from nitro reduction) is an ortho/para director. So the Br would likely go ortho or para to the amine, which is at position where the nitro was. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Option D: steps i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine), iii) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), iv) H3PO2 (maybe decomposition of diazonium to form a hole?), v) Br2 (bromine addition), vi) CH3COCl (acetylation), vii) nitration again.

But after step ii, we have aniline. Step iii would form a diazonium salt. Step iv is H3PO2, which is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts to produce phenols. So step iv would convert the diazonium into a phenol group (-OH). Then, step v is Br2/FeBr3, which would brominate the phenol? But phenol is a strong activating group, so bromine would add ortho or para. Then, step vi is acetylation (Friedel-Crafts), which requires an activated ring. But if we have Br and OH groups, which are deactivating, Friedel-Crafts might not work. Hmm.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add nitro groups, then Br, but that doesn't make sense because acetylation requires an activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine (using Fe/HCl) to get aniline.

3. Acetylate: Friedel-Crafts acylation. Aniline is activating, so acetyl would add in ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but the target has acetyl in position 1, nitro in 5, Br in 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the target has acetophenone as the main group, perhaps the acetyl should be added first.

So:

1. Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Bromination: adds Br meta to acetyl (position 3).

3. Nitration: adds nitro meta to acetyl (position 5).

So the three substituents are at 1,3,5.

But in the options, none of the options A to D have only these three steps. So perhaps the options include more steps, but some are unnecessary or perhaps involve other functional groups that are later modified.

Wait, looking at option B:

i) Br2 (adds Br),

ii) HNO3 (adds nitro),

iii) CH3COCl (adds acetyl).

But Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. After adding Br and nitro, the ring is deactivated, so step iii might not work. So that's a problem.

Option C:

i) HNO3 (nitro),

ii) Fe/HCl (reduce to amine),

iii) CH3COCl (acetyl),

iv) Br2,

v) HNO3,

vi) NaNO2,

vii) H3PO2.

But Friedel-Crafts after adding amine? Aniline is activating, so acetylation is possible.

So step i: nitro at position 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: acetylate. Since amine is activating, acetyl would go ortho or para to amine (which is position 1). So acetyl at position 3 or 5.

Wait, but the target has acetyl at 1, but in this case, the amine is at 1. So perhaps the acetyl would go to position 3.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Let's think about the target molecule. It has three substituents on the benzene ring: acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So perhaps in the correct sequence, the acetyl is added first, then Br, then nitro.

Which brings me back to option A: i) acetyl, ii) Br, iii) nitro. But then the problem is that option A has additional steps which would modify the nitro group, which we don't want.

Wait, what's the purpose of the other steps in the options?

Looking at option A, after steps i, ii, iii, the molecule has acetyl, Br, and nitro. So that's the target. But the option continues, so steps iv to vii are applied, which would change things.

So perhaps none of the options A-D directly produce the target in steps i-iii, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the target also has an ethan-1-one structure, which is the acetyl group. So the correct substituents are present, but perhaps the other steps in the options are introducing and then removing other groups.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is adding the nitro group first, then the acetyl, then bromine.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring. If nitro is present, which is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts may not work. So perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding the acetyl, then nitro, then bromine, but then the nitro is reduced and then added again? That seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C. Let's try to think through option C's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine (Fe/HCl) → aniline.

iii) Acetylate using CH3COCl → acetophenone derivative. Wait, but aniline is at position 1. So acetylation would add acetyl in ortho (2 or 6) or para (4) relative to the amine.

Hmm, but in the target, the acetyl is at position 1. So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after step iii, the acetyl is at position 3 relative to the amine at position 1. Then, step iv is Br2, which would be directed by the acetyl (now at 3) and the amine at 1.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by elimination.

The target has nitro, Br, and acetyl in a meta arrangement. To get this, the acetyl must be added first because it's a strong deactivating group that requires an active ring for its own addition.

Looking for the option that starts with Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Only option A starts with acylation (step i), followed by bromination (step ii), then nitration (step iii). So after these three steps, we have the three substituents in correct positions.

But option A has more steps after that, which would interfere. So why are there more steps? Maybe those steps are to modify other functional groups.

Wait, maybe the steps after are for installing or eliminating other groups. Let's think: after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target structure. But then, what happens in steps iv and beyond?

Step iv: Fe/HCl. Fe and HCl is for reducing nitro groups to amines. But in the target, we have nitro, so this step would change it. That's not desired.

So perhaps the correct sequence isn't in the options as is, but perhaps the correct option is another.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each step in the options.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetylation. Since amine is activating, acetyl would add ortho or para to amine. So, acetyl at 3 or 5.

iv) Br2 → bromination directed by acetyl (meta) and amine (ortho/para). If acetyl is at 3, then Br would be at position 5 (meta to acetyl) or position 2 (ortho to acetyl, but that's meta to amine).

Wait, maybe Br adds at position 5.

v) HNO3 → nitration. The ring has substituents at 1 (amine), 3 (acetyl), and 5 (Br). So, the next nitration would be directed by the strongest director. Acetyl is a strong meta director. So nitro would go meta to acetyl, which is position 6 or 2. But position 2 is adjacent to amine (position 1), which is ortho/para director, but maybe the acetyl is stronger.

Alternatively, the acetyl directs the nitro to position 6, but position 5 is already occupied by Br.

Hmm, not sure.

But this seems to be getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Maybe I should focus on the correct order of substituent addition.

The correct order is:

1. Acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Bromine via FeBr3 (meta direction).

3. Nitro via HNO3 (meta direction).

So the correct option would have these three steps in this order.

Looking at the options, option A does this, but then continues with other steps which would alter the structure.

So why are the options having more steps? Because perhaps some steps are for protection or for activating certain positions.

Wait, perhaps the additional steps are for installing and then removing certain groups. Wait, like in some cases, you might need to protect a group before adding another.

Wait, but the target doesn't have any other groups; it's just the three substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are for installing and then reactivating the ring. For example, sometimes you need to reduce a nitro group to an amine to make the ring more reactive again.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is present, so any reduction steps would be bad.

Wait, perhaps the options involve steps that mistakenly add and remove groups, but the correct option is the one where the substituents are added in the correct order without altering any after.

But in the options, all of them have more than three steps. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, let me think again.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce to amine (Fe/HCl) → amine at 1.

iii) Acetylation → acetyl at position 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Bromination → Br at position 5 (meta to acetyl, which is at 3).

Wait, that would give acetyl at 3, Br at 5, nitro at 1. Hmm, but the target has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So perhaps this isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added at position 5, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct. Let's think:

Option B:

i) Br2 → Br at position 1.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at position 4 (para to Br).

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl. But the ring is deactivated by Br and nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hence, this step fails.

So option B isn't correct.

So perhaps the only option that starts with acetylation, followed by bromination, then nitration is option A. But in option A, after the initial three steps, step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce nitro to amine. That would change the structure, which we don't want.

Unless, perhaps, steps iv to vii are for removing some other groups. Wait, perhaps the steps are adding multiple groups, but only the final steps give the target structure.

Wait, maybe the initial steps in option A lead to the target, but the rest of the steps are for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl at 3 or 5 (ortho/para to amine).

iv) Br2 → Br at position 5 (meta to acetyl at 3) or position 2 (ortho to acetyl).

v) HNO3 → nitro at some position, but where?

But this seems to be adding and removing substituents, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to OH group.

Now, structure has OH at 1.

v) Br2 → Br adds ortho or para to OH (positions 2,4,6).

vi) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts acylation. OH is activating, so acetyl would add ortho or para to OH.

Assuming OH is at 1, acetyl could be at 3 or 5.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (OH), 3 (acetyl), and v?) Where would the nitro go?

But this seems to be a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps this is not the correct approach, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me try to think about the correct order again. The target has three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro.

The acetyl must be first because it's a strong deactivator, and Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring.

So:

Step 1: Acetophenone.

Step 2: Bromination → Br at position 3.

Step 3: Nitration → nitro at position 5.

So, the correct sequence is i) acetyl, ii) Br, iii) nitro.

Looking for an option that has this sequence. Option A has this (i, ii, iii), but then continues with steps iv to vii.

But why are those steps necessary? Because the target is achieved after step iii. So perhaps the option is wrong because it includes unnecessary steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the subsequent steps are for another purpose. Wait, perhaps the nitro group was added in a different position and needs to be moved.

Wait, perhaps after adding nitro, another nitration is done, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii) in option A are for introducing and then removing some other functional groups. For example, perhaps the Fe/HCl is for reducing nitro to amine, but that's not desired.

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck and should make a decision.

Based on the earlier analysis, the correct sequence is acetyl first, then Br, then nitro. So the option that starts with Friedel-Crafts, then bromination, then nitration is option A.

But option A's steps iv to vii might be extraneous, but perhaps they are part of a larger synthesis. Wait, perhaps the steps are for installing and then activating the ring again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not certain. I'm a bit confused because the initial three steps in option A would give the target, but the other steps would alter it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the nitration step in option A. After adding acetyl and Br, would the nitration add the nitro group in the correct position?

In acetophenone, the acetyl is meta-directing. With Br already at position 3, when nitration occurs, the incoming nitro would be directed by the acetyl, which is stronger, so it would go to position 5. So after step iii, the target is achieved.

Then, steps iv to vii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium.

Hmm, but this seems to be altering the nitro group, which we don't want. So the target would be destroyed in steps iv.

So that can't be correct. So perhaps option A isn't the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let me check option D again.

Option D: steps i to iii:

i) nitro,

ii) Fe/HCl → amine,

iii) NaNO2 → diazonium.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to OH.

v) Br2 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → acetylation.

vii) HNO3 → nitration.

Wait, after step iv, the structure is phenol (OH at position 1). Then, bromination would add Br ortho or para to OH, which are positions 2,4, or 6.

Then, acetylation would add acetyl ortho or para to OH. Suppose acetyl is added at position 3. Then, nitration would be directed by acetyl (meta) and OH (ortho/para). But I'm not sure.

This seems convoluted and doesn't lead directly to the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine at 1.

iii) CH3COCl → acetyl at position 3 (meta to amine, which is at 1).

iv) Br2 → Br would add meta to acetyl (position 6), or ortho to amine (position 2). But acetyl is stronger.

v) HNO3 → nitration. Now, substituents are nitro at 1, acetyl at 3, Br at 6. Where would another nitro go? Maybe position 5, meta to acetyl.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the new nitro group? Not sure.

vii) H3PO2 → hydrolysis.

But this seems to be adding more groups and complicating the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is none of these, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of substituents. The target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl, Br, nitro.

So, each of the options must have three substitution steps. Let's see:

Option A: steps i, ii, iii add three groups (acetyl, Br, nitro). Then, steps iv-vii modify.

Option B: steps i adds Br, step ii adds nitro, step iii adds acetyl. But acetyl won't add as the ring is deactivated.

Option C: steps i adds nitro, step ii reduces to amine, step iii adds acetyl, step iv adds Br, step v adds another nitro. So now, four substituents? That's more than target.

Option D: steps i adds nitro, step ii reduces, step iii makes diazonium, step iv adds OH, step v adds Br, step vi adds acetyl, step vii adds nitro again. So target would have four substituents, which is not correct.

So, only option A's first three steps add the correct substituents. But the problem is steps iv and beyond.

Wait, perhaps the steps iv to vii in option A are for introducing and then removing a nitro group, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option A, even though it has extra steps. Maybe the question is considering only the initial three steps, but that's not how the options are presented.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think about the possibility of using directing groups and activating/deactivating effects.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl group can be introduced after nitro and Br have been added. But the ring would be deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last, but that would require the ring to be activated, which isn't possible after adding Br and acetyl.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the correct sequence is acetyl first, then Br, then nitro. The only option that does this is option A. But option A's steps iv to vii alter the structure, which we don't want. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group in option A is not in the correct position. Let me think again.

After adding acetyl (1), Br (3), and nitro (5), the structure is correct. So the first three steps in option A produce the target. But the option has more steps, which suggests that perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are for another purpose, such as protecting groups. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Since all the options seem to have more steps than needed, perhaps the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are added in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has the acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully considered, as electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like acetyl and nitro are meta-directing, while bromine, being a halogen, is ortho/para-directing.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine meta to the acetyl group, resulting in bromine at position 3.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group meta to the acetyl group, resulting in nitro at position 5. At this point, the target molecule is achieved.
4. **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve Fe/HCl (reduction), HNO₃ (nitration), NaNO₂/HCl (diazotization), and H₃PO₂ (hydrolysis). These additional steps are unnecessary and would alter the target structure, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group para to bromine, resulting in nitro at position 4.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation attempts to add the acetyl group. However, the ring is now deactivated due to the presence of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed. This option fails.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group ortho or para to the amine. Assuming acetyl is added at position 3, the structure now has amine at 1 and acetyl at 3.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine meta to the acetyl group, resulting in bromine at position 6.
5. **Step v**: Nitration adds another nitro group, which would interfere with the target structure.
6. **Steps vi–vii**: Diazotization and hydrolysis further complicate the structure. This option does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1 on benzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Hydrolysis with H₃PO₂ converts the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group at position 1.
5. **Step v**: Bromination adds bromine ortho or para to the hydroxyl group, resulting in bromine at position 2 or 4.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation adds the acetyl group ortho or para to the hydroxyl group.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration adds another nitro group, which would interfere with the target structure. This option does not lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions must first introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination and nitration to achieve the correct substituent positions. Option A is the only one that follows this sequence in the first three steps. However, the additional steps in Option A (iv–vii) are unnecessary and would alter the target structure. Despite this, Option A is the closest to the correct synthesis pathway.

**Answer: A**
