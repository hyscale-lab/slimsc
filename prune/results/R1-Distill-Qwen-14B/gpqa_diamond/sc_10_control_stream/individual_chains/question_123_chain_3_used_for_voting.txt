Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a supernova has occurred in our galaxy. A part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference, so that means they're not accelerating, they're moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Got it.

The problem states that from the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a really high speed—like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So this probably involves some relativistic effects? Or maybe not, maybe it's just a straightforward kinematic problem since the options are given in km and the time is 50 seconds. Hmm.

Wait, the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So it's a matter of figuring out the time dilation between the two frames because of their relative velocity.

Oh right, because if the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the galaxy, the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. But wait, the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find out how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame during that same interval, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. But actually, the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation. So the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta's clock as ticking slower.

Wait, but the problem says the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Because in special relativity, the relative velocities add up in a certain way, but for speeds much less than c, you can consider them the same magnitude but opposite directions.

So the gamma factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 60,000 km/s, let's compute v/c: 60,000 / 300,000 is 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

Gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Calculating sqrt(0.96): approximately 0.98. So 1 / 0.98 is about 1.0204. So gamma is roughly 1.0204.

Time dilation: the proper time (time in the moving frame) is related to the time in the stationary frame by t' = gamma * t. Or wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it would experience less time. So the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the ejecta's time (t'). So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Wait, let's get this right. Suppose I'm in the galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards me at speed v. So from my perspective, a clock on the ejecta ticks slower. So if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock (t'), then in my frame, more time has passed. How much more?

So t' is the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta). The galaxy's frame (rest frame) would measure a longer time, t = gamma * t'.

But wait, wait: No, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So for the ejecta, the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are at the same point in the ejecta's frame. But in the galaxy's frame, these events are moving, so the time between them is longer.

So the proper time t' is the time in the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. The galaxy's frame would measure t = gamma * t'.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 50 * 1.0204 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame (which is longer than the ejecta's time).

So distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ ?

60,000 *51.02 = let's calculate.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 *1.02=61,200.

So total is 3,000,000 +61,200= 3,061,200 km. Wait, that's 3,061,200 km. But looking at the options:

Option D) is 3,060,000 km. Close, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. Maybe I approximated too much.

v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

0.96= 96/100=24/25.

sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24)=4.89898 approx.

So sqrt(24)/5 is 0.979796. So gamma is 1/0.979796 ≈1.0203.

So gamma is approximately 1.0203.

So t = gamma * t' =1.0203 *50=51.015 seconds.

So time in galaxy's frame is approximately 51.015 seconds.

Distance is 60,000 km/s *51.015 s =60,000 *51.015.

Let me compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.

60,000 *0.015=900.

So 3,060,000 +900=3,060,900 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but 3,060,900 is a bit more than that. So perhaps the calculation needs to be more precise.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, which would be strange given the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but the options don't have 3,060,900. The closest option is D) 3,060,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and the ejecta is at rest.

But we're to find the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So, perhaps, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So the ejecta's time is 50 seconds, which corresponds to more time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and is just a straightforward velocity multiplied by time. Because if that's the case, then the distance would be 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But why would the problem mention that both are inertial frames if it's not a relativistic scenario? Maybe I have to consider the relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the fact that time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time.

So, perhaps, the correct approach is to calculate the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t', then multiply by v for the distance.

So gamma is about 1.0203, so t=50*1.0203=51.015 s.

Distance =60,000 *51.015=3,060,900 km.

But this isn't one of the options. The options are 2,940,000; 3,000,000; 2,880,000; 3,060,000.

So why is 3,060,000 an option? Perhaps because gamma was taken as (1 + (v/c)^2 ) or something else. Wait, perhaps we're supposed to calculate using a different approximation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, so we can ignore time dilation. Then, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time is 50 seconds. So distance is speed * time, 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But why would the problem then mention the frames of reference and that both are inertial? Because that suggests that they are moving relative to each other. But if we ignore relativity, then the time is the same in both frames. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, if we ignore relativity, the time experienced in each frame is the same, so the distance in the galaxy's frame is simply 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But the problem says that both are inertial frames, which is a relativistic concept. So, perhaps, the problem expects us to consider the time dilation.

Wait, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let's think again.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, in 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because the ejecta is moving, the time experienced would be longer. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving, so the proper time is less. So t' = t / gamma.

Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time between two events. So in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end) happen at the same place (since it's the ejecta moving), so t' is the proper time. The galaxy's frame, which sees the ejecta moving, would have a longer time.

So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So t = gamma * t' =1.0203 *50≈51.015 s.

So, the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.015 s =3,060,900 km.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.0204, leading to 51.02 seconds, so 60,000 *51.02=3,061,200. Hmm, which is 3,061,200. Closest option is D) 3,060,000.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, let's re-read the question.

The question says: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, the time is 50s in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find how much distance the ejecta covers in the galaxy's frame during that time. But because of time dilation, more time has passed in the galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame is longer.

So, the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.

But to find the galaxy's frame time, we can use the time dilation formula.

t = gamma * t'

So t' is 50s, so t = gamma *50.

Which is approximately 51.015 s.

So, distance is 60,000 *51.015=3,060,900 km.

Hmm, but the option D is 3,060,000, which is 3,060,000. So perhaps the calculation is to be done more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2 c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Calculating sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute it more precisely.

0.96 = (0.98)^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98.

Let me compute it: 

Let me find x where x^2 = 0.96.

x ≈ 0.9798.

Because 0.9798^2 = (approx) (0.98 -0.0002)^2 =0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004≈0.960008.

Which is a bit higher than 0.96, so let's adjust.

Let me try x=0.979796.

x^2 = (0.979796)^2.

Let me compute:

= (979796e-6)^2.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using binomial expansion for sqrt(0.96).

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 -0.04) ≈1 - (0.04)/(2*1) - (0.04)^2/(8*1^3) + ... 

But that might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, since 0.96 = 24^2 / 25^2, because 24^2=576, 25^2=625. No, 576/625 is 0.9216, which is not 0.96. Oops, that's wrong.

Wait, 0.96 = 96/100=24/25. So sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is about 4.89898.

So sqrt(24)/5=4.89898/5≈0.979796.

So, gamma=1/0.979796≈1.020305.

So gamma is approximately 1.020305.

So t=gamma *50=1.020305 *50=51.01525 seconds.

So distance =60,000 *51.01525=?

60,000 *50=3,000,000.

60,000*1.01525=60,000*(1 +0.01525)=60,000 +60,000*0.01525.

60,000 *0.01525=915.

So total is 3,000,000 +915=3,000,915.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 60,000 *1.01525=60,000 *1 + 60,000*0.01525.

Which is 60,000 +915=60,915 km/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. 60,000 km/s multiplied by 1.01525 s gives 60,000 *1.01525 =60,915 km/s*s? No, no, units are km/s * s → km.

Wait, 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.01525 s is:

60,000 *51.01525 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.01525=60,000 *0.015=900, and 60,000 *0.00025=15. So 900 +15=915.

So total is 3,060,000 +915=3,060,915 km.

So approximately 3,060,915 km. But the options don't have that; the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the intended approach is to use a linear approximation for gamma, considering that v is 0.2c, and gamma is approx 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Let me compute that.

v²/(2c²) = (0.2c)^2/(2c²) )= (0.04 c² )/(2 c² )= 0.04/2=0.02.

So gamma ≈1 +0.02=1.02.

So t=1.02 *50=51 s.

Distance=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So option D.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So the problem might be intended to use this approximation, leading to option D.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D) 3,060,000 km.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the galaxy. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's reference frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativity of Time**: Since the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames moving relative to each other, time dilation must be considered. The time experienced in the galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]

3. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:
   Using \( t = \gamma t' \):
   \[
   t = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.015 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}
   \]

5. **Closest Option**:
   The calculated distance (\( 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option \( \text{D} \), \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This slight discrepancy arises from approximations in the calculation of \( \gamma \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Wait, that's a really high speed—like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So this probably involves some relativistic effects? Or maybe not, maybe it's just a straightforward kinematic problem since the options are given in km and the time is 50 seconds. Hmm.

Oh right, because if the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the galaxy, the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation.

So we need to find out how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame during that same interval, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time. But actually, the time experienced in each frame is different due to time dilation. So the galaxy's frame would see the ejecta's clock as ticking slower.

Wait, but the problem says the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy. So from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Because in special relativity, the relative velocities add up in a certain way, but for speeds much less than c, you can consider them the same magnitude but opposite directions.

So the gamma factor, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 60,000 km/s, let's compute v/c: 60,000 / 300,000 is 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

Gamma would be 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Calculating sqrt(0.96): approximately 0.98. So 1 / 0.98 is about 1.0204. So gamma is roughly 1.0204.

Time dilation: the proper time (time in the moving frame) is related to the time in the stationary frame by t' = gamma * t. Or wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it would experience less time. So the time in the galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the ejecta's time (t'). So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Wait, let's get this right. Suppose I'm in the galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards me at speed v. So from my perspective, a clock on the ejecta ticks slower. So if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock (t'), then in my frame, more time has passed. How much more?

So t' is the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta). The galaxy's frame (rest frame) would measure a longer time, t = gamma * t'.

But wait, wait: No, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So for the ejecta, the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are at the same point in the ejecta's frame. But in the galaxy's frame, these events are moving, so the time between them is longer.

So the proper time t' is the time in the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. The galaxy's frame would measure t = gamma * t'.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0204 * 50 ≈ 50 * 1.0204 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. From the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame (which is longer than the ejecta's time).

So distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ ?

60,000 *51.02 = let's calculate.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 *1.02=61,200.

So total is 3,000,000 +61,200= 3,061,200 km. Wait, that's 3,061,200 km. But looking at the options:

Option D) is 3,060,000 km. Close, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, let me recheck the gamma calculation. Maybe I approximated too much.

v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

0.96= 96/100=24/25.

sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24)=4.89898 approx.

So sqrt(24)/5 is 0.979796. So gamma is 1/0.979796 ≈1.0203.

So gamma is approximately 1.0203.

So t = gamma * t' =1.0203 *50=51.015 seconds.

So time in galaxy's frame is approximately 51.015 seconds.

Distance is 60,000 km/s *51.015 s =60,000 *51.015.

Let me compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000.

60,000 *0.015=900.

So 3,060,000 +900=3,060,900 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but 3,060,900 is a bit more than that. So perhaps the calculation needs to be more precise.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering relativity, which would be strange given the speed is 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, but the options don't have 3,060,900. The closest option is D) 3,060,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and the ejecta is at rest.

But we're to find the distance the ejecta moves in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So, perhaps, the time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So the ejecta's time is 50 seconds, which corresponds to more time in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and is just a straightforward velocity multiplied by time. Because if that's the case, then the distance would be 60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But why would the problem mention that both are inertial frames if it's not a relativistic scenario? Maybe I have to consider the relative velocity and time dilation.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the fact that time in the galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time.

So, perhaps, the correct approach is to calculate the time in the galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma * t', then multiply by v for the distance.

So gamma is about 1.0203, so t=50*1.0203=51.015 s.

Distance =60,000 *51.015=3,060,900 km.

But this isn't one of the options. The options are 2,940,000; 3,000,000; 2,880,000; 3,060,000.

So why is 3,060,000 an option? Perhaps because gamma was taken as (1 + (v/c)^2 ) or something else. Wait, perhaps we're supposed to calculate using a different approximation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, so we can ignore time dilation. Then, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, and the time is 50 seconds. So distance is speed * time, 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But why would the problem then mention the frames of reference and that both are inertial? Because that suggests that they are moving relative to each other. But if we ignore relativity, then the time is the same in both frames. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, if we ignore relativity, the time experienced in each frame is the same, so the distance in the galaxy's frame is simply 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But the problem says that both are inertial frames, which is a relativistic concept. So, perhaps, the problem expects us to consider the time dilation.

Wait, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let's think again.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, in 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the galaxy's frame? Because the ejecta is moving, the time experienced would be longer. So the galaxy's frame sees the ejecta moving, so the proper time is less. So t' = t / gamma.

Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time between two events. So in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end) happen at the same place (since it's the ejecta moving), so t' is the proper time. The galaxy's frame, which sees the ejecta moving, would have a longer time.

So t = gamma * t'.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So t = gamma * t' =1.0203 *50≈51.015 s.

So, the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.015 s =3,060,900 km.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

So perhaps the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.0204, leading to 51.02 seconds, so 60,000 *51.02=3,061,200. Hmm, which is 3,061,200. Closest option is D) 3,060,000.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't make sense because the question specifies the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, let's re-read the question.

The question says: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So, the time is 50s in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find how much distance the ejecta covers in the galaxy's frame during that time. But because of time dilation, more time has passed in the galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: since the ejecta is moving at v towards the galaxy, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame is longer.

So, the distance is v multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame.

But to find the galaxy's frame time, we can use the time dilation formula.

t = gamma * t'

So t' is 50s, so t = gamma *50.

Which is approximately 51.015 s.

So, distance is 60,000 *51.015=3,060,900 km.

Hmm, but the option D is 3,060,000, which is 3,060,000. So perhaps the calculation is to be done more precisely.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2 c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Calculating sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute it more precisely.

0.96 = (0.98)^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98.

Let me compute it: 

Let me find x where x^2 = 0.96.

x ≈ 0.9798.

Because 0.9798^2 = (approx) (0.98 -0.0002)^2 =0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004≈0.960008.

Which is a bit higher than 0.96, so let's adjust.

Let me try x=0.979796.

x^2 = (0.979796)^2.

Let me compute:

= (979796e-6)^2.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using binomial expansion for sqrt(0.96).

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 -0.04) ≈1 - (0.04)/(2*1) - (0.04)^2/(8*1^3) + ... 

But that might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, since 0.96 = 24^2 / 25^2, because 24^2=576, 25^2=625. No, 576/625 is 0.9216, which is not 0.96. Oops, that's wrong.

Wait, 0.96 = 96/100=24/25. So sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5.

sqrt(24) is about 4.89898.

So sqrt(24)/5=4.89898/5≈0.979796.

So, gamma=1/0.979796≈1.020305.

So gamma is approximately 1.020305.

So t=gamma *50=1.020305 *50=51.01525 seconds.

So distance =60,000 *51.01525=?

60,000 *50=3,000,000.

60,000*1.01525=60,000*(1 +0.01525)=60,000 +60,000*0.01525.

60,000 *0.01525=915.

So total is 3,000,000 +915=3,000,915.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 60,000 *1.01525=60,000 *1 + 60,000*0.01525.

Which is 60,000 +915=60,915 km/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. 60,000 km/s multiplied by 1.01525 s gives 60,000 *1.01525 =60,915 km/s*s? No, no, units are km/s * s → km.

Wait, 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.01525 s is:

60,000 *51.01525 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.01525=60,000 *0.015=900, and 60,000 *0.00025=15. So 900 +15=915.

So total is 3,060,000 +915=3,060,915 km.

So approximately 3,060,915 km. But the options don't have that; the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the intended approach is to use a linear approximation for gamma, considering that v is 0.2c, and gamma is approx 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Let me compute that.

v²/(2c²) = (0.2c)^2/(2c²) )= (0.04 c² )/(2 c² )= 0.04/2=0.02.

So gamma ≈1 +0.02=1.02.

So t=1.02 *50=51 s.

Distance=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km. So option D.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So the problem might be intended to use this approximation, leading to option D.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D) 3,060,000 km.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the galaxy. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) pass in the ejecta's reference frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativity of Time**: Since the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames moving relative to each other, time dilation must be considered. The time experienced in the galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]

3. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:
   Using \( t = \gamma t' \):
   \[
   t = 1.0203 \times 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.015 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.015 \approx 3,060,900 \, \text{km}
   \]

5. **Closest Option**:
   The calculated distance (\( 3,060,900 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option \( \text{D} \), \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This slight discrepancy arises from approximations in the calculation of \( \gamma \).

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
