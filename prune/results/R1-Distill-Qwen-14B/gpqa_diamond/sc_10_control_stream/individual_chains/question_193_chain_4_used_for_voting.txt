Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, or d = 1/plx. Wait, so parallax is inversely proportional to distance. That's right.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to plx^-5. Because 1 over plx to the fifth is the same as plx to the negative fifth. So N ∝ plx^{-5}.

But I need to find how N changes with distance. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. Let me write that out. plx = 1/d, so plx^{-5} would be (1/d)^{-5} which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, that seems straightforward.

Wait no, wait a second. Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But I think I need to be careful here. The number of stars per unit volume, perhaps? Or maybe the number in a certain range. Because if N varies as d^5, that's a big increase as you go further, which doesn't make sense because density of stars decreases with distance from the Galactic center, but wait, maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, the question specifies "per unit range of distance, r." So perhaps it's the number of stars in a shell at distance r, with thickness dr. Oh, that makes more sense. So imagine you're looking at a thin slice or shell at a distance r, how many stars are there in that shell as r increases.

In that case, I think the number density in 3D space would be something like N ∝ r^2, due to the surface area of a sphere. But wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a volume depends on the density, and the volume. If the density is uniform, then the number would scale with volume, which is r^3. But if the density decreases, the scaling changes.

Wait, but in this problem, the number N is given to vary as 1/plx^5. So let's re-express everything in terms of distance d, since plx is 1/d.

So N ∝ plx^{-5} → N ∝ (1/d)^{-5} → N ∝ d^5.

Wait, that suggests that as d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5, which is a very steep rise. But in reality, the number of stars in a region should decrease with distance because they are spread out more, but maybe this is in a specific part of the sky where the distribution is different.

But the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So perhaps for each unit distance r, how does N change as r increases.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number of stars. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r+dr is dN = N(r) * 4π r² dr. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4π r² dr, multiplied by the number density (stars per volume).

Wait, but in this problem, the number of stars varies as plx^{-5} = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me approach it step by step.

First, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d: plx = 1/d.

The number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. So,

N ∝ (1/plx)^5 = (d)^5.

So N = K * d^5, where K is a constant.

But wait, that would mean that as the distance increases, the number of stars increases, which seems counterintuitive because stars are typically more concentrated in the plane of the galaxy and nearby. But perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number per unit distance. Hmm.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then for each increment in d, the number of stars increases by d^5. But that's not per unit distance. Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars per unit volume. Because the number of stars per unit volume would be density, and the number in a shell would be density multiplied by the volume of the shell.

Wait, let me think again.

The problem says N varies with plx as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ plx^{-5}.

But plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius d would be N_shell = N(d) * 4π d² dr. Wait, no. Because N(d) is the number of stars per unit volume? Or is N(d) the total number up to distance d?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about what N represents. The question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/plx is d, so N ∝ d^5.

But wait, if N is the number of stars in a region, perhaps as a function of distance. But wait, the number of stars in a region (like a volume) at a certain distance, or perhaps the number per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number. Let me denote the number of stars per unit volume as n. Then n ∝ d^5.

But wait, number density is stars per unit volume, so n = N/(volume). If n ∝ d^5, then the number of stars in a volume would be N = n * volume.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the number of stars in an infinitesimal shell dr at distance d.

The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dr.

If n ∝ d^5, then substituting, the number in the shell would be (K d^5) * 4π d² dr = K *4π *d^7 dr.

Wait, but that can't be right because d^7 is a very high power. So number in the shell would increase as d^7, which seems too steep. But the question gives options up to r^5, so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup. Let me re-express the given relation.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Parallax plx = 1/d, so 1/plx = d.

So N ∝ d^5.

So the number of stars increases as the distance increases, which is surprising. But perhaps in this scenario, the star count increases with distance.

Wait, the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the number per unit distance, not per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a certain solid angle, like per unit distance. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is considering a region of fixed solid angle, and as you go further, the number of stars in that solid angle varies with distance.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if you have a fixed area on the sky (which is a solid angle), then the number of stars in that area as a function of distance.

So for a fixed solid angle Ω, the number of stars would be the number density multiplied by the volume, but the volume in that solid angle is a function of distance.

Wait, the volume for a given solid angle Ω is roughly Ω * (d)^3, but wait, for a thin shell, the volume would be Ω * (4π) [but wait, perhaps the volume per unit distance is Ω * 4π r² dr. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a fixed solid angle is proportional to the distance to the fifth power.

Wait, but let me approach this differently.

The number of stars in a given volume is N = n * V, where n is the number density and V is the volume.

If N varies as d^5, which would be the case if n is constant, then V would be proportional to d^3 (since V = (4/3)π d^3 for a sphere). So N = n * (4/3 π d^3) → N ∝ d^3.

But the given relation is N ∝ d^5, which would require n ∝ d^2.

Wait, so if n is the number density, and it's proportional to d^2, then N = n * V = d^2 * (4/3 π d^3) ) → N ∝ d^5. That works.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if the number of stars in a region varies as d^5, then the number as a function of distance per unit range would be the derivative, perhaps.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's the number per unit distance, or the rate of change of N with respect to r.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So the number per unit distance would increase as d^4. But that's not one of the options. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait, but the options are all in terms of r, not d. So perhaps I should just express everything in terms of r instead of d.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model it.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

If we have a region of fixed solid angle Ω, then the number of stars in that region at distance d would be N = K * d^5, where K is some constant.

But wait, that can't be correct because as d increases, the volume increases, but the number of stars in a fixed solid angle should decrease if the density decreases. Wait, but perhaps in this case, the density is increasing with distance, which is contrary to the usual case. But the problem gives this relation, so I have to go with it.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx is smaller (larger distance), N increases.

So for a fixed solid angle, the number of stars observed increases as you look further away, which would imply that the number density is increasing with distance. But that's not typical in the galaxy, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, that's the case.

Now, the question is, how does N change with distance. So perhaps we're to express the change in N when you move to a distance r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

Wait, but the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases as r^5. So the answer would be B.

But earlier I thought maybe it's the number in a shell, which would be proportional to r^7. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the number of stars and the distance more carefully. Let me frame it in terms of variables.

Let me define N as the number of stars in a region of the sky, and d as the distance. The problem states that N ∝ 1/plx^5, but plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

So N = K d^5, where K is a proportionality constant.

Then, the change in N with distance would be dN/dr = 5 K d^4. That means for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars increases by 5 K d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4.

But that's not one of the options. The options don't have r^4 as the answer for per unit distance; option C is r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how N changes with distance, which could be interpreted as the function N(r) itself. So if N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the answer would be option B.

But I'm getting a bit confused about what exactly is being asked.

The question says: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, perhaps the term "per unit range of distance" implies the number of stars per unit distance. So if N(r) is the number of stars in a region, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5 K r^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r, which would be dN = (number density) * (volume of shell). So if number density is n(r) = K r^5, then the number in the shell is n(r) * 4 π r^2 dr = K r^5 * 4 π r^2 dr = 4 π K r^7 dr. So dN = (4 π K) r^7 dr. So the number in the shell increases as r^7, which isn't one of the options either.

But this is getting more confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in the region varies as the fifth power of the distance. So when distance increases, the number increases as r^5. So the answer would be option B: ~ r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the rate at which N increases, which would be the derivative. As I thought earlier, dN/dr = 5 K r^4, so that's proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. The question's wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the functional form of N(r), which is r^5. So the answer would be B.

But I need to make a decision. Let me read the question again.

"how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Ah, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. So for each additional unit of distance, how many more stars are there. So that would be the derivative, dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C: ~ r^4.

But wait, another way to approach this: perhaps N is the number of stars per unit volume, but that's not what the question says. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

So if the number of stars (total in a region) is N, and N ∝ d^5, then the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is given as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, so the number in a volume would be (d^5) * (volume), which would be d^5 * (4/3 π d^3) ) = (4/3 π) d^8. So that's not matching the options either.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the key is that parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5 → d^5. So N varies as d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the relationship is N ∝ r^5, so the answer is B.

But looking at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So if N is proportional to r^5, the answer is B.

But earlier I thought about the derivative, which would be 5 r^4, but the question is about how the number changes, not the rate of change.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, perhaps it's the number per unit distance. So if N is the total number, then per unit distance, it's N(r) per dr, which would be the derivative, and that's proportional to r^4.

But I'm not sure. The wording is a bit ambiguous. If the number of stars in a region (fixed solid angle?) increases as r^5, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4.

But the options have r^5 (B) and r^4 (C). So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the number of stars as a function of distance, not per unit. So if N ∝ r^5, the change with distance is proportional to r^5. So the answer would be B.

I'm a bit torn, but I'll go with the initial approach that N ∝ r^5, so the answer is B.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can rewrite the relationship as \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This phrasing suggests the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \propto r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the closest match is \( \sim r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

However, there is ambiguity in interpreting the question. If the question is asking for the functional form of \( N(r) \) itself, then \( N \propto r^5 \), which corresponds to option B. Despite this ambiguity, the phrasing "per unit range of distance" strongly suggests the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), making \( \sim r^4 \) the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

Wait no, wait a second. Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. But I think I need to be careful here. The number of stars per unit volume, perhaps? Or maybe the number in a certain range.

The problem says N varies with plx as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ plx^{-5}.

But plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius d would be N_shell = N(d) * 4π d² dr. Wait, no. Because N(d) is the number of stars per unit volume? Or is N(d) the total number up to distance d?

So for a fixed solid angle Ω, the number of stars would be the number density multiplied by the volume, but the volume in that solid angle is a function of distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a fixed solid angle is proportional to the distance to the fifth power.

Wait, but let me approach this differently.

The number of stars in a given volume is N = n * V, where n is the number density and V is the volume.

If N varies as d^5, which would be the case if n is constant, then V would be proportional to d^3 (since V = (4/3)π d^3 for a sphere). So N = n * (4/3 π d^3) → N ∝ d^3.

But the given relation is N ∝ d^5, which would require n ∝ d^2.

Wait, so if n is the number density, and it's proportional to d^2, then N = n * V = d^2 * (4/3 π d^3) ) → N ∝ d^5. That works.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if the number of stars in a region varies as d^5, then the number as a function of distance per unit range would be the derivative, perhaps.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's the number per unit distance, or the rate of change of N with respect to r.

So N = K d^5, where K is a proportionality constant.

Then, the change in N with distance would be dN/dr = 5 K d^4. That means for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars increases by 5 K d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d^4.

But that's not one of the options. The options don't have r^4 as the answer for per unit distance; option C is r^4.

Wait, perhaps the term "per unit range of distance" implies the number of stars per unit distance. So if N(r) is the number of stars in a region, then the number per unit distance would be dN/dr, which is 5 K r^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r, which would be dN = (number density) * (volume of shell). So if number density is n(r) = K r^5, then the number in the shell is n(r) * 4 π r^2 dr = K r^5 * 4 π r^2 dr = 4 π K r^7 dr. So dN = (4 π K) r^7 dr. So the number in the shell increases as r^7, which isn't one of the options either.

But this is getting more confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in the region varies as the fifth power of the distance. So when distance increases, the number increases as r^5. So the answer would be option B: ~ r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the rate at which N increases, which would be the derivative. As I thought earlier, dN/dr = 5 K r^4, so that's proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. The question's wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the functional form of N(r), which is r^5. So the answer would be B.

But I need to make a decision. Let me read the question again.

"how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Ah, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. So for each additional unit of distance, how many more stars are there. So that would be the derivative, dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C: ~ r^4.

But wait, another way to approach this: perhaps N is the number of stars per unit volume, but that's not what the question says. The question says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5.

So if the number of stars (total in a region) is N, and N ∝ d^5, then the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is given as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, so the number in a volume would be (d^5) * (volume), which would be d^5 * (4/3 π d^3) ) = (4/3 π) d^8. So that's not matching the options either.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the key is that parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5 → d^5. So N varies as d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the relationship is N ∝ r^5, so the answer is B.

But looking at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So if N is proportional to r^5, the answer is B.

But earlier I thought about the derivative, which would be 5 r^4, but the question is about how the number changes, not the rate of change.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm, perhaps it's the number per unit distance. So if N is the total number, then per unit distance, it's N(r) per dr, which would be the derivative, and that's proportional to r^4.

But I'm not sure. The wording is a bit ambiguous. If the number of stars in a region (fixed solid angle?) increases as r^5, then the number per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4.

But the options have r^5 (B) and r^4 (C). So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the number of stars as a function of distance, not per unit. So if N ∝ r^5, the change with distance is proportional to r^5. So the answer would be B.

I'm a bit torn, but I'll go with the initial approach that N ∝ r^5, so the answer is B.


The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can rewrite the relationship as \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This phrasing suggests the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \propto r^4.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the closest match is \( \sim r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

However, there is ambiguity in interpreting the question. If the question is asking for the functional form of \( N(r) \) itself, then \( N \propto r^5 \), which corresponds to option B. Despite this ambiguity, the phrasing "per unit range of distance" strongly suggests the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), making \( \sim r^4 \) the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C
