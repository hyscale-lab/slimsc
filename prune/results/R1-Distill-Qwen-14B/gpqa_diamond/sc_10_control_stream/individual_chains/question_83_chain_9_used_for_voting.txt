Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Let me start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution. So, when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be concentration multiplied by volume in liters. Oh wait, units are cm³, which is the same as mL, so 20 mL. So moles are 0.05 M (which is 0.05 mol/L) times 0.02 L, which is 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 40 mL, so the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. Moles is still 0.001, and new volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate how much NaOH is needed. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH would also be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So at equivalence point, 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the problem asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So in the solution, we'll have some amount of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) from the NaOH.

At 25% titration, let me think. The moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, adding 0.00025 mol of OH- would convert 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is initial diluted volume (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH added, so 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

To find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73 (since Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73). Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately: 1.85e-5. Log(1.85)=0.267, so -5 + 0.267 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So plugging in the concentrations: pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.25. Now, let's check the options: option A says 4.26, which is close. Option D is 4.57, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer solution and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 mL. So moles are indeed 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Then, when 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So that's correct.

So the moles of HA and A^- are 0.00075 and 0.00025, respectively. When calculating concentrations, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333, so log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25. So around 4.25, which is approximately 4.26 when rounded, so option A is 4.26. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the ratio exactly. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3, so the ratio is exactly 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) which is approximately -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which rounds to 4.25. So the option with 4.26 is A. So for the first part, the pH is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol (since we started with 0.001 mol of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus 10 mL of NaOH (since 25% is 2.5 mL, equivalence is 10 mL). So 50 mL total volume, 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate ions is moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw/Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, which would mean the hydrolysis doesn't produce a lot of OH-, so the pH would be just slightly above 7? Wait, but wait: Wait, no, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in solution it should react with water to produce OH-.

Wait, but if Kb is 5.4e-10, which is very small, so the hydrolysis is minimal, so the pH might not be too far from 7. Let me compute it accurately.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

Let x be the concentration of OH- formed. So:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is so small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the options for equivalence point are A) 8.52, B)6.73, C)7, D)6.92.

Hmm, my calculation gives pH around 9.02, which isn't an option. But none of the options have a pH above 8.5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up on the concentration. Wait, at equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, in 50 mL, so 0.02 M. That's correct.

So according to this, the pH should be around 9.02. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: wait, is the solution at equivalence point a 0.02 M solution of acetate? Because sodium acetate is a salt, and it dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

Wait, but perhaps I didn't account for activity coefficients or something else, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Maybe I should try using the formula for pH at equivalence point for weak acids.

Wait, for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, at equivalence, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, so pOH is about 4.98 → pH=9.02. Hmm.

But none of the options have a pH above 8.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe I should consider that the solution is at 25%, but wait no, the question says at equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73. So Kb for acetate is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 5.405e-10. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without the approximation. So:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - (Kb * 0.02) = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*Kb*0.02)]/(2)

Plugging in Kb=5.405e-10:

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *5.405e-10 *0.02 = approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) = the second term dominates, so sqrt is about sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.575e-6 ] / 2 → approximate because the other root is negative.

So x ≈ (6.57e-6)/2 → 3.285e-6.

Wait, that's different from the earlier 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH = -log(3.285e-6) ≈ 5.484 → pH = 14 -5.484 =8.516, which is approximately 8.52. That's option A's equivalence pH: 8.52.

Wait, so why did the approximation give a different answer? Because Kb is so small, the assumption that x << 0.02 is not valid? Wait, but 3.285e-6 is 3.285e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.285e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. Wait, no, 3e-6 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold. So why the discrepancy?

Oh wait, I must have miscalculated when I didn't make the approximation. Let me re-express the quadratic equation more accurately.

Let me compute x using the quadratic formula without approximation.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) = 0.

The discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*(5.405e-10 *0.02) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)≈ 6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2. The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515, which is approximately 8.52. So that's option A's equivalence point pH.

So, putting it all together. At 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52. So option A would be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Henderson-Hasselbalch gave 4.25, which is 4.26 rounded. And the equivalence is 8.52. So option A matches.

But wait, I thought earlier that the equivalence pH was around 9, but that was under the incorrect assumption of using the approximation. The exact calculation gives 8.52, which is option A's equivalence point.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forms:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ion in water is governed by:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \(x\) be the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) ions at equilibrium. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately \(4.26\), and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Let me start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution. So, when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be concentration multiplied by volume in liters. Oh wait, units are cm³, which is the same as mL, so 20 mL. So moles are 0.05 M (which is 0.05 mol/L) times 0.02 L, which is 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 40 mL, so the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. Moles is still 0.001, and new volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's calculate how much NaOH is needed. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH would also be 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So at equivalence point, 10 mL of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the problem asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added. So in the solution, we'll have some amount of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) from the NaOH.

At 25% titration, let me think. The moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, adding 0.00025 mol of OH- would convert 0.00025 mol of acetic acid to acetate. So moles of acetic acid left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is initial diluted volume (40 mL) plus 2.5 mL NaOH added, so 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

To find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73 (since Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73). Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately: 1.85e-5. Log(1.85)=0.267, so -5 + 0.267 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately 4.73.

So plugging in the concentrations: pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, at 25% titration, the pH is around 4.25. Now, let's check the options: option A says 4.26, which is close. Option D is 4.57, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer solution and use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me recheck. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 mL. So moles are indeed 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Then, when 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So that's correct.

So the moles of HA and A^- are 0.00075 and 0.00025, respectively. When calculating concentrations, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333, so log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25. So around 4.25, which is approximately 4.26 when rounded, so option A is 4.26. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the ratio exactly. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3, so the ratio is exactly 1/3. So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) which is approximately -0.4771. So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529, which rounds to 4.25. So the option with 4.26 is A. So for the first part, the pH is around 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution is now a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are 0.001 mol (since we started with 0.001 mol of acetic acid). The total volume is 40 mL (diluted acetic acid) plus 10 mL of NaOH (since 25% is 2.5 mL, equivalence is 10 mL). So 50 mL total volume, 0.05 L.

The concentration of acetate ions is moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw/Ka. Since Ka is 1.85e-5, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, that's a very small Kb, which would mean the hydrolysis doesn't produce a lot of OH-, so the pH would be just slightly above 7? Wait, but wait: Wait, no, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in solution it should react with water to produce OH-.

Wait, but if Kb is 5.4e-10, which is very small, so the hydrolysis is minimal, so the pH might not be too far from 7. Let me compute it accurately.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

Let x be the concentration of OH- formed. So:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Since Kb is so small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the options for equivalence point are A) 8.52, B)6.73, C)7, D)6.92.

Hmm, my calculation gives pH around 9.02, which isn't an option. But none of the options have a pH above 8.5. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up on the concentration. Wait, at equivalence, the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol, in 50 mL, so 0.02 M. That's correct.

So according to this, the pH should be around 9.02. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: wait, is the solution at equivalence point a 0.02 M solution of acetate? Because sodium acetate is a salt, and it dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

Wait, but perhaps I didn't account for activity coefficients or something else, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Maybe I should try using the formula for pH at equivalence point for weak acids.

Wait, for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, at equivalence, the solution is a solution of the conjugate base. So, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, so pOH is about 4.98 → pH=9.02. Hmm.

But none of the options have a pH above 8.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe I should consider that the solution is at 25%, but wait no, the question says at equivalence point.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73. So Kb for acetate is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 5.405e-10. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without the approximation. So:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - (Kb * 0.02) = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² +4*Kb*0.02)]/(2)

Plugging in Kb=5.405e-10:

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *5.405e-10 *0.02 = approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) = the second term dominates, so sqrt is about sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x ≈ [ -5.405e-10 + 6.575e-6 ] / 2 → approximate because the other root is negative.

So x ≈ (6.57e-6)/2 → 3.285e-6.

Wait, that's different from the earlier 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 3.285e-6 → pOH = -log(3.285e-6) ≈ 5.484 → pH = 14 -5.484 =8.516, which is approximately 8.52. That's option A's equivalence pH: 8.52.

Wait, so why did the approximation give a different answer? Because Kb is so small, the assumption that x << 0.02 is not valid? Wait, but 3.285e-6 is 3.285e-6, and 0.02 is 2e-2, so 3.285e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. Wait, no, 3e-6 is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold. So why the discrepancy?

Oh wait, I must have miscalculated when I didn't make the approximation. Let me re-express the quadratic equation more accurately.

Let me compute x using the quadratic formula without approximation.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) = 0.

The discriminant D= (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*(5.405e-10 *0.02) = (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)≈ 6.576e-6.

So x= [-5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6]/2. The positive root is (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515, which is approximately 8.52. So that's option A's equivalence point pH.

So, putting it all together. At 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52. So option A would be the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the Henderson-Hasselbalch gave 4.25, which is 4.26 rounded. And the equivalence is 8.52. So option A matches.

But wait, I thought earlier that the equivalence pH was around 9, but that was under the incorrect assumption of using the approximation. The exact calculation gives 8.52, which is option A's equivalence point.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and forms:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.25.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The hydrolysis of acetate ion in water is governed by:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \(x\) be the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) ions at equilibrium. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \(K_b\) is very small, \(x \ll 0.02\), so:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately \(4.26\), and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately \(8.52\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
