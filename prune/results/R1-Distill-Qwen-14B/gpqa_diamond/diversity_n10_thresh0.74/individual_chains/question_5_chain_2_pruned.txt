Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem says we have a quantum mechanical operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator P is like a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the components are P_x, P_y, P_z, and the operator in the direction n would be P · n. So the operator we're considering is P · n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, maybe? Because any direction in the x-z plane can be represented in spherical coordinates with φ = 0 or π, but wait, since it's in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π, but the polar angle θ is what defines the direction. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the unit vector is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since φ is 0 here because it's in the x-z plane.

So the operator P
