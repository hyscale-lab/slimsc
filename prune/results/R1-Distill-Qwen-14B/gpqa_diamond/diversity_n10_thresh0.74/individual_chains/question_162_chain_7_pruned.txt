Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a metric in general relativity or differential geometry, and I need to figure out the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. Oh right, sometimes metrics are written in terms of coordinates, and the denominators might hint at a specific geometry.

I remember that for a pseudosphere, or a hyperboloid, the metric can have terms that resemble a hyperbolic space. But wait, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for a hyperboloid of one sheet. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, a pseudosphere might refer to a space with constant negative curvature. 

Wait, the form of the metric here looks a bit like the metric for a sphere, but with a minus sign perhaps? Or maybe not. Let me think. The standard metric for a sphere of radius a in 2D is ds² = (a²/(a² - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), but I don't think that's exactly the case here.

Let me look at the given metric again. It's ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). That suggests that the metric is only defined where x² + y² < 4, so the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So maybe this is a compact space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, so the radius is given as 2. Hmm, but how does that tie into the metric?

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is in a certain coordinate system, and I need to find the area using the metric. The area of a surface in 2D is given by the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but that's for the area element. But wait, here we're dealing with a 2D metric, so the area would be an integral over x and y of the area element.

Wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant. Let me calculate the determinant of this metric. The metric tensor in 2D has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x^2 - y^2), and g_yy is the same. The off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero because the metric is diagonal: (dx² + dy²) multiplied by the factor. So the metric tensor is diagonal, with entries g_11 = 32/(4 - r^2) and g_22 the same, where r² = x² + y².

So the determinant g = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, but the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) would be 32/(4 - r²). Because sqrt(g) = sqrt( (32/(4-r²))^2 )
