Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. They're asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30 degrees, and what form f has.

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at the equator, right? So for a dipole, the radiation is strongest at 90 degrees, and falls off as you go towards the poles (0 or 180 degrees). The pattern is sin(theta) squared or something like that.

Wait, no. Wait, the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2. So the maximum is at theta = 90 degrees, which is the equator of the dipole. So at theta = 0 (along the dipole axis), the radiation is zero. So in that case, the maximum power would be when sin theta is 1, so at 90 degrees.

Wait, but the question here is about a spheroid charge distribution. Spheroid can be prolate or oblate. But the symmetry is along the z-axis. So perhaps it's a dipole-like radiation. Hmm.

But wait, the problem states that the maximum power is A. So f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So f would have a maximum at some angle theta. If the spheroid is symmetric along z, the maximum power would be at theta=90 degrees, like the dipole case.

Wait, but the question says the maximum is A. So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle multiplied by the solid angle? Or is A the total power? Wait, the question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". Wait, the question says "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of lambda and theta". So f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum of f is A? Or the maximum total power
