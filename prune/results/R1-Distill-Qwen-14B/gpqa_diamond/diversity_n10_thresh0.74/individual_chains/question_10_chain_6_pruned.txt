Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see what the question says.

The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D. Wait, the options are labeled a to d, and the possible answers are options A to D, which correspond to a, b, c, d. So each letter option (a-d) is a possible exoplanet, and the answer is choosing which of those is the highest density.

Let me read the options again.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. I remember Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is mass over volume. If the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is the same as Earth, that suggests the volume is larger. Because density = mass/volume. So if mass doubles but density stays same, volume doubles. So radius should be bigger, since volume depends on radius cubed. So this planet has higher mass but same density as Earth. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Composition affects density because composition determines the mass to volume ratio. Earth's composition is mostly rock and metal. So if a planet has same composition, its density should be similar to Earth's. Because density is determined by the materials it's made of. So if it's 5 times more massive but same composition, its radius must be larger. Let's think: mass scales with radius cubed if density is same. So Earth's mass is M, radius R. If another planet has 5M, then radius would be cube root(5) times larger, approximately 1.7 times. So this planet's density would be same as Earth, 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. Because density isn't just mass, it's mass per unit volume. So if it's half the mass but same composition, the volume would be smaller. Let's see: mass is (1/2) M. Volume scales with radius^3. So the radius would be cube root(1/2) which is about 0.7
