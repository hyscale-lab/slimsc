Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, the dipole transition rules.

So, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions (which I think this is about) state that the change in the angular momentum quantum number (l) can be ±1. And the magnetic quantum number (m) can change by 0, ±1. Also, the principal quantum number (n) can change by ±1, I think. But wait, the transition must involve a photon emission or absorption, so the energy difference must be correct.

Wait, but the question says it's a two-step process. So from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

Let me outline the possible steps. Starting at n=3, l=0 (s orbital). So first transition, from n=3 to a lower n, say n=2. Because going to n=1 in one step would require a larger change in n, which might not be allowed. Wait, no, in the selection rules, n can change by any integer, but transitions with Δn = ±1 are more probable? Or is the selection rule for electric dipole transitions Δn = ±1? Hmm, I think the main selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. For Δn, it doesn't have a strict selection rule except that it can't be zero, but usually, the transitions are from higher to lower n by emitting a photon, and Δn can be any positive or negative integer, but the probability depends on the matrix elements. But for hydrogen, the energy levels are such that you can't go from 3 to 1 in one dipole transition because the energy difference would require a photon with a certain wavelength, but perhaps the matrix elements would be zero? Let me think.

Wait, the dipole transition's matrix element depends on the integral of the wavefunctions and the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to r times a spherical harmonic, I think. So the matrix element <n', l', m' | r Y
