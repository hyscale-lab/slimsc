Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, which are different organic compounds.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other options don't have amines, it's probably an O-H group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1—that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest some sort of aromatic ring, perhaps with substituents that have conjugated double bonds, like a carbonyl.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This is a broad singlet. Aromatic protons usually don't go this high. Oh wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Wait, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm and would be broad because it's exchanging. So this might be a carboxylic acid group.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton from something else, but in this case, the peak is at 10.5, which is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The integration shows two protons each, so perhaps two sets of doublets, which suggests para substitution. Like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having two protons each as doublets. Wait, no, for a para-substituted group, perhaps each substituent is a single group with two Hs, or maybe it's a substituent that causes splitting into doublets. Alternatively, it's a substituent that's attached to the ring, leading to two sets of doublets. Wait, another thought—maybe it's a para-dimethyl substituent? Or perhaps a substituent like a carbonyl group.

Wait, no, looking back, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid (which is usually around 1700 but can be lower if conjugated). Wait, wait, no. Wait, carboxylic acids have higher wavenumber for C=O, around 1700. Maybe 1720 is more like an ester or a ketone? But the 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid. Hmm, conflicting info perhaps.

Wait, another possibility is that the IR peak at 1720 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring. Maybe a benzene ring with a carbonyl substituent. Wait, wait, but then the NMR data—what's the 10.5 ppm? If it's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone, but no, ketones don't have protons attached. Wait, maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenol OH is usually around 5-7 ppm and broader, but in this case, the 10.5 is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe the compound is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached. For example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group, maybe in a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but let's look at the other NMR data. At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. Hmm, maybe a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. So maybe a CH attached to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group. And 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)—a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe as a branch. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, like an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl and a branching chain. For example, perhaps a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is connected to a branched chain.

Wait, so the 10.5 ppm is probably the carboxylic acid proton. Then, the IR at 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl. Then the NMR shows a benzene ring with two substituents each causing the doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents would cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. So for example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, you might have two sets of doublets. But that's not exactly this case.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. Let's say the benzene ring has a carbonyl group (like a ketone) in the para position. But then, where is the carboxylic acid?

Wait, maybe the structure is a substituted benzoic acid. For example, 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Then the IR would have a strong carbonyl peak from the acid, but wait, the IR has 1720 which is more typical for an ester or a ketone. Because carboxylic acids usually have a C=O around 1700 cm-1, but maybe this is a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm in the NMR is a broad peak, which aligns with a carboxylic acid. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Now, the substituent on the benzene ring. Let me think about the NMR. The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests two substituents on the ring, each in a para position. Wait, but benzene is symmetric. So if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two substituents, each in para, but perhaps it's a single substituent that's in the para position, and the deshielding of the protons is causing two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's not directly on the ring but attached to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CO-OH. Let me think, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and a branching chain. For example, something like (para-substituted) benzene with a side chain that has a carbonyl, and then some branching.

Looking at the NMR's 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH(CH2CH3) group, perhaps, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that is a ketone, but that doesn't align with the 10.5 ppm peak.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group. For example, benzene with a propanoic acid substituent. So the structure would be benzene with a -CH2-CO-OH group attached in the para position.

Wait, but in that case, the 1H NMR would have the carboxylic acid proton at 10.5, and the aromatic protons
