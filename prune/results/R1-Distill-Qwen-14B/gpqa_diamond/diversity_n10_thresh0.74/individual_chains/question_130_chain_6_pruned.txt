Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting objects using ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second to the first energy level. But in this case, it's being absorbed. So the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, meaning we observe this absorption line in the quasar's spectrum.

Redshift, z, is the measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). Right?

The rest wavelength for Lyman alpha is about 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. But wait, the question says the clouds absorb at 1216 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait: no, wait a second. Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So yes, 121.6 nm = 1216 A.

But wait, if the hydrogen is neutral, it's in the intergalactic medium or something. So when the quasar's light passes through this hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at its rest wavelength, 1216 A, but if the cloud is moving away or the universe is expanding, that wavelength is shifted.

Now, the question is about the redshift needed for the absorption line to be in the optical range detectable by a ground-based telescope.

Wait, but optical telescopes have a certain wavelength range. I think visible light is about 400-700 nm. So we're talking about the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line being within this range.

So the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121
