Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let's start by breaking down each piece of information given.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and it's 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the molecular weight, so that suggests the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The peak at 158 could be something else, maybe a fragment or an isotope. Alternatively, if there's a chlorine in the molecule, the molecular ion might be around 156 and 158 because chlorine has isotopes. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance for both isotopes (about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37). So if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would show peaks at m/z 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). So that might fit. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate that: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is about 35, O is 16*2=32. 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. Oh, so molecular weight is 156. That matches the m/z. The other peak at 158 would be Cl-37, so 12 +5 would be same, 37 instead of 35. So 156 and 158 would be molecular ions. So that fits.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2 as well. Same molecular weight 156. So same as A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula for that is C6H5ClO2(COCl?), wait, no. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is OCl-CO-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5COClO? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: chloroformate ester. Structure is O=C(OCl)-O-Ph? No, wait, chloroformate is OC(O)Cl. So the formula would be C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So molecular formula would be C7H5ClO3. Let's compute: C7 is 84, H5 is 5, Cl is 35, O3 is 48. 84+5=89 +35=124 +48=172. That's higher than 156, so probably not. But wait, the molecular ion is at 156, so C can't be the answer because its molecular weight is higher. So C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is also C7H5ClO2, same as A and B. So molecular weight 156 again.

So all A, B, D have molecular weight 156. So the molecular ion makes sense for each.

Next, let's look at the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak is from 3500 to 2700. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500. Alcohols also have a broad O-H stretch. So could be either.

But there's also a strong sharp peak at 17
