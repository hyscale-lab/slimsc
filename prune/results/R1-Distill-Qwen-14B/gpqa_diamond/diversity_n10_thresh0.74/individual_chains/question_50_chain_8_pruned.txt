Okay, so I have this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams are used to visualize particle interactions and their contributions to processes. Each diagram has vertices and propagators, and the number of loops is related to the complexity of the diagram.

The question says that my colleague has a note with a "size estimate" that looks like a formula involving some constants. The formula is alpha cubed times g squared times sqrt(2), multiplied by 8, and then divided by (4 pi)^6, all multiplied by (Q/M)^2.

I think the key here is to figure out how the number of loops relates to the factors in the formula. I remember that loop integrals in Feynman diagrams often involve factors of 4 pi and the loop momentum, which comes from the integration in the calculation. Also, each loop typically contributes a factor of (4 pi)^something, depending on the dimension.

Wait, let me think about how the loop order affects the scaling. I'm pretty sure that each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4 pi)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Since this is four-dimensional spacetime (as the theory is on 4D spacetime), d=4. Each loop would then contribute (4 pi)^2, because 4/2 is 2. 

So, looking at the formula, there's a denominator of (4 pi)^6. If each loop contributes (4 pi)^2, then the number of loops would be 6 divided by 2, which is 3. So three loops.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The denominator in the formula is (4 pi)^6, and each loop brings in (4 pi)^2. So the number of loops would be 6/2=3. That makes sense.

Let me think about other factors. The formula also includes alpha^3 and g^2. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is related to the electric charge in QED. In QED, a loop diagram like a photon vacuum polarization has a single loop, and the amplitude would have factors like alpha/(4 pi) each. So higher loops would involve higher powers of alpha and more denominators of 4 pi.

Wait, but the formula here has (4 pi)^6 in the denominator. If each loop brings (4 pi)^2, then 3 loops would mean 3 factors of (4 pi)^2
