Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so that should simplify things a bit because the initial momentum is zero.

Wait, the reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Right, and the pion is stationary. So I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But since the pion is at rest, the total energy released is its rest mass energy, minus the rest mass of the products.

Wait a second, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. But what about the neutrino? Oh, neutrinos are super light. I think for this problem, we can consider the neutrino's rest mass to be negligible. So the neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its kinetic energy.

So the total energy before decay is just the pion's rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy goes into the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the pion is at rest, the decay products must have opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I think I can model this using the conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu is approximately its kinetic energy, which is the same as its total energy.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. This should equal the initial energy, which is the pion's rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. The rest energy of the muon is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu, where K_mu is its kinetic energy.

Similarly
