Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I need to figure out what's happening here. Let me read through the problem again.

Mike designed a high-resolution TEM that operates at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around. But some gas particles are still there, as detected by the mass spectrometer. 

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on things like the pressure, volume, and temperature of the compartment. But then, when he started the electron beam, something interesting happened. The mean free path changed to λ2, even though the temperature stayed the same. So why would λ2 be different from λ1?

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It's calculated using the formula λ = 1/(√2 n σ), where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d^2 n), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules. But maybe more relevant is the formula involving pressure and molar properties.

Oh, right, the mean free path can also be expressed as λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d^2 P), where P is the pressure. Or wait, another formula I think is λ = (P * L) / (N), where L is the volume, but that might be for flow. Wait no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of ideal gas laws.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles. So n, the number density, is n = P/(k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. So substituting into the mean free path formula, λ = 1/(√2 n σ) becomes
