Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

So the problem says: An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Alright, let's start by jotting down the given data:

- Initial rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So, the rest energy Mc² is 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV/c².

- The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.

- After fission, two fragments: let their rest masses be m1 and m2. It's given that one is twice the other. Let me assume m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 * m2.

- The sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Hmm, but wait, M is the initial mass, and the sum is 99% of M. So some mass is lost as binding energy or something? Or maybe the energy from the fission goes into kinetic energy. But I remember that in fission, the mass of the products is less than the initial, hence energy is released.

Wait, but the problem gives the rest mass energies. Let me clarify. The initial nucleus has rest mass energy 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments have rest mass energies adding up to 0.99 * 300 GeV, which is 297 GeV. So the mass 'lost' is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy, I suppose.

Wait, but the question is about the kinetic energy of just the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to find T1 correctly using relativistic calculations and subtract the non-relativistic (classical) approximation.

Wait, but how does the mass relate here? Let me think. The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2.

But wait, since the rest masses are m1 and m2, and we know m1 = 2 m2. Let's compute their rest masses first.

We have m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 = 2 m2.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the first equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M => 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99/3) M.

So m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 2 * 0
