Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this electron microscopy question. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal here is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because having fewer gas particles would improve the electron microscopy by reducing scattering, right? But Mike's mass spectrometer detected some gas particles still present. So even though the vacuum is super high, there are a few gas molecules around.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. So, in this ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is super low, so λ1 must be quite large. Because when pressure is low, the mean free path increases since molecules don't bump into each other as often.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something about the mean free path. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature stayed the same, so that factor doesn't change. Hmm, why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path is primarily determined by the gas density, which depends on pressure. Oh wait, but the pressure is the same as before because the vacuum pumps are probably running and the system has stabilized. So why did the mean free path change? Unless there's another factor.

Wait, the question says that when the electron beam is on, some gas molecules might be getting excited or ionized. Because the electron beam has a high energy, it can interact with the gas molecules. Those high-energy electrons might cause gas molecules to ionize or even get removed from the compartment.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, it's a source of electrons. These electrons could collide with the gas molecules, causing them to ionize. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, which affects how the electrons in the microscope scatter. Wait, no, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. So perhaps the ionization affects the collisions.

Wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the gas is ionized, the interactions change. But wait, in the presence of an electron beam, some gas particles might get ionized. So, the number density of neutral gas molecules might decrease, but the ionized ones could behave differently.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, λ1 was based on all the gas particles, including any ions. Oh, but when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas particles are more likely to be ionized, and ions interact differently with the electron beam.

Wait, but the question states that the mean free path of the gas molecules (probably the neutral ones) changes. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing additional scattering.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons from the beam could be colliding with the gas molecules. That would add to the collision events, effectively increasing the number of collisions the gas molecules undergo. So, the mean free path λ would decrease because the gas molecules are colliding more often—either with each other or with the electrons from the beam.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is calculated based on the collision rate between gas molecules. If the electron beam introduces another source of collisions (like gas molecules colliding with electrons), then the effective mean free path might be shorter. Because now the gas molecules are more likely to collide with the electron beam's particles (if any) or perhaps their own movement is affected.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing more scattering of the gas particles, making their mean free path shorter because the beam-induced collisions are adding to the usual ones.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is usually calculated considering only collisions between the gas molecules themselves. If the electron beam introduces another type of collision (like gas molecules hitting beam electrons), then each gas molecule would experience more frequent collisions, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So, in the presence of the electron beam, the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1 because the gas molecules are colliding more often—either with each other or with the electrons in the beam.

So, the original λ1 was determined without the beam, so it's the mean free path under static vacuum conditions. But when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to collide with electrons from the beam, so λ2 becomes less than λ1.

So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1. Looking at the options:

Option C) λ2 < λ1.

So the answer should be C.


Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV, where vacuum pumps create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr). Despite this, some gas molecules remain in the sample compartment, and Mike calculates their mean free path as λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the temperature remains constant.

The mean free path (λ) is primarily determined by the gas density, which depends on pressure. In the ultra-high vacuum, λ1 is large because the low pressure minimizes collisions between gas molecules. However, when the electron beam is turned on, the high-energy electrons interact with the gas molecules, potentially ionizing them or causing additional collisions. These interactions increase the effective collision rate for the gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path (λ2) compared to λ1.

Thus, the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors that reduce the mean free path, resulting in λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
