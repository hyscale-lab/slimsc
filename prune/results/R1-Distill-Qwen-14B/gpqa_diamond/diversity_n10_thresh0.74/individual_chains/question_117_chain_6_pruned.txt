Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember correctly, refers to compounds that have chiral centers, meaning they are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These compounds are also known to be optically active because they can rotate plane-polarized light.

Let me look at the options one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Hmm, biphenyl rings. So, this is a structure where two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. Now, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that could make the molecule chiral, then it would have optical isomerism. Let me visualize this. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, so each benzene ring has two nitro groups and one ester group. Wait, 6,6'-dinitroâ€”so each ring has a nitro at position 6, and 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each ring has a carboxylate ester at position 2. 

Wait, for a biphenyl compound to have optical isomerism (enantiomers), it needs to have a plane of symmetry or not. If the substituents are arranged asymmetrically about the central bond, the molecule could be chiral. So, if the substituents on each ring are such that the two rings are mirror images of each other but the molecule as a whole isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral. 

In this case, each ring has two nitro groups (at 6 and 6') and two ester groups (at 2 and 2'). Wait
