Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me think through what I remember. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this is about the Boltzmann distribution, I think.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k*T) ). But wait, the problem states that the energy difference is given. So, if E is the higher energy level, then for star_1, the population is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I think that means the number of atoms in that specific higher energy level is twice as much in star_1. So, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, maybe the excitation is the probability, so maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2.

But the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? Because the iron atoms' energy levels are the same, regardless of the star. So E_j and E_i are the same for both stars, but their temperatures T1 and T2 are different.

So the ratio of the populations would be (n1)/(n2) = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T1) ) / (g_j/g_i * exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T2) ) )? Wait, no. Because for each star, the ratio within itself would be based on their own temperature.

Wait, let me correct. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But the question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n1_upper / n2_upper = 2. But wait, that's not the same as the ratio between the ratios. Let me think:
