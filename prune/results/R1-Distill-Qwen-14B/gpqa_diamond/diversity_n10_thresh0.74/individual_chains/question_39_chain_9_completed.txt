Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, none of the particles were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So they only exist between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalizable. Because in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle somewhere must be 1. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given here is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So the function is a complex number. The absolute square would be the square of the modulus, right? So the modulus is sqrt( (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ). Because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, actually, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

But wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So when you compute the modulus squared, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Because modulus squared is (Re ψ)^2 + (Im ψ)^2.

So the integral of this over all x where the particle exists (x from 1 to 3) should be 1.

But wait, the question says that when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3. Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that region. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|^2 dx should equal 1.

So the integral would be the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, because the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Oh wait, no, 0.5 squared is 0.25. So yes.

So the integral becomes:

∫ from 1 to 3 [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can break this into two integrals:

a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let's compute each part.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

Evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ from 1 to3 dx is 2 (since 3-1=2). So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding these together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

I need to calculate that. Let's get the approximate value.

ln(2) is about 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So a² is approximately 0.7202. Therefore, a is the square root of that.

What's the square root of 0.7202?

Well, sqrt(0.72) is roughly 0.8485, because 0.85^2 is 0.7225, which is a bit higher. Let me check: 0.8485^2 = (0.8 + 0.0485)^2 = 0.64 + 2*0.8*0.0485 + (0.0485)^2 ≈ 0.64 + 0.0776 + 0.00235 ≈ 0.71995, which is close to 0.7202. So a is approximately 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is the closest.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.

So the wave function is given, and the integral of |ψ|² must be 1. I correctly computed the modulus squared by squaring real and imaginary parts and adding them. Then I broke the integral into two parts and correctly calculated each. The first integral was ln(2), the second gave 0.5. So solving for a² gives 0.5 / ln(2), which is about 0.72, so a is about sqrt(0.72) ≈ 0.848, so 0.85 is correct. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two separate integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_1^3 = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 dx = 3 - 1 = 2
   \]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
