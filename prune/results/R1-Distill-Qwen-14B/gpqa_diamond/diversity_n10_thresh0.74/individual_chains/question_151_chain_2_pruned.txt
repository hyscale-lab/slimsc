Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I need to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0.

Hmm. I think in quantum mechanics, when you have an observable represented by a matrix, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible measurement results. Then, the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue, after projecting the state onto them.

Wait, but maybe I should check if P is a Hermitian matrix because observables must be Hermitian. Let me look at P.

First, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out to check if it's Hermitian. For P to be Hermitian, each element P_ij must equal the complex conjugate of P_ji.

Looking at the elements:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

So P is real, so the complex conjugate is the same. Let's check if P is symmetric. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) is same. (2,3) is also 1/sqrt(2), and (3,2) is same. (1,3) and (3,1) are both 0. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So it's a valid observable.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. Then, the probability of getting 0 is the sum of the squared amplitudes of the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But wait, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvalues first. Let me find the characteristic equation for P.

The matrix P:

0   1/√2   0
1/√2 0   1/√2
0   1/√2   0

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

-λ     1/√2      0
1/√2  -λ      1/√2
0      1/√2    -λ

Calculating the determinant:

|P - λI| = -λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ] .

Wait, expanding the determinant. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to notice some pattern. The matrix seems to be symmetric, and perhaps tridiagonal. Maybe it's a circulant matrix or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by looking for symmetries or considering eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that P looks like a graph Laplacian or some similar structure. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

Let me compute the determinant of (P - λI):

The matrix is:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 * something.

Wait, expanding along the first row:

det = (-λ) * det(minor at 1,1) - (1/√2) * det(minor at 1,2) + 0 * det(...)

Minor at (1,1) is the submatrix:
[ -λ   1/√2 ]
[ 1/√2  -λ ]

Its determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2
