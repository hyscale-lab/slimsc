Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They give the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the solution conditions are such that the EDTA is in its correct form, maybe deprotonated enough to form the complex.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So, the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. The solution has a complex, Ca-EDTA, which is at 0.02 M. I think I need to consider the dissociation of this complex. If the complex dissociates, it would release Ca²+ ions and EDTA^4- ions.

The reaction for the dissociation should be something like: Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

Wait, but the formation constant K is given. Formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ Ca-EDTA. The formation constant Kf would be [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, we're looking at the dissociation, which is the reverse reaction. So the dissociation constant Kd would be the reciprocal of Kf. So Kd = 1/Kf. Since Kf is 5e10, Kd would be 2e-11.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Formation constant Kf is [complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So if the complex is Ca-EDTA, then Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So the dissociation would have Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA] = 1/Kf ≈ 2e-11.

So, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA. Assuming it dissociates a little bit,
