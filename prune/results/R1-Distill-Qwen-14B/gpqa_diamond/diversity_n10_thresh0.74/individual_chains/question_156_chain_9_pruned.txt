Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about two reactions with different starting alkenes and then analyzing the products using HPLC. So, first, I'll try to understand what each reaction does.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

Since the starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the two substituents (CH2CH2 groups) opposite each other, the epoxidation would form an epoxide. Now, I think that with mCPBA, the reaction typically proceeds with an electrophilic addition, where the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the more substituted oxygen ends up on the more substituted carbon. But wait, for trans alkenes, the epoxide formation might lead to a trans epoxide as well? Hmm, maybe I should think about the specific product.

Wait, no. Wait, when an alkene with E geometry reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed has the two new oxygen atoms from the same face of the double bond? Or opposite? Oh, right, peracid addition is a concerted process, so the peracid adds across the double bond with the oxygen adding to each carbon from the same face. So for a trans double bond, the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. Let me draw it mentally.

(E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is between C4 and C5. The groups on either side are CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but wait, octene is C8, so maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, no, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH
