Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). Hmm. 

I remember that in two dimensions, the energy levels often depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, the potential here seems to have a radial part and an angular part, right? So maybe I can separate the problem into radial and angular components.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor that. Oh, I see: (1/2 + (3/2)cos²θ) multiplied by kr². So that's like kr² [ (1/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ] or something? No, wait, (1/2)kr² is the first term, and the second is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So combining terms: V(r,θ) = kr² (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) = kr² [ (3 cos²θ +1 ) / 2 ].

Hmm. So the potential is a function of r and cosθ. Let me think about whether this system is separable. For the Schrödinger equation, if the potential allows for separation into r and θ parts, then the solution can be written as a product of radial and angular parts. 

Wait, the given potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ can be rewritten as kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ). Alternatively, factor out (1/2) to get (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the potential in terms of polar coordinates. The particle is moving in two dimensions, so using polar coordinates (r, θ) makes sense. The Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is known, but when the potential depends on r and θ, it can complicate things. But if the potential can be written as a sum of functions each depending only on r or θ, then the equation might separate.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to rewrite the potential in terms
