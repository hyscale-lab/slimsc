Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, maybe exoplanet studies or stellar spectroscopy. 

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. The key thing is that each spectrograph has a brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16. So, a star must be bright enough (apparent V magnitude) to be seen by both.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me read the question again. Oh right, ESPRESSO observes stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means V ≤17, because lower magnitude is brighter. Wait, no, brighter stars have lower magnitude numbers. So, 'brighter than 17 mag' means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because if a star is at 16 mag, it's brighter than 17. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V ≤17. For HIRES, apparent V ≤16. So, any star that is brighter than mag 16 can be seen by both? Or wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So to be detected by both, the star must have apparent V mag ≤16, because that's the limit for both. Because if a star is 16 mag, HIRES can see it, and ESPRESSO can also see it (since 16 is <=17). But if a star is 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't, because HIRES only goes to 16. So, only stars with apparent V ≤16 can be detected by both.

But wait, some stars have their apparent magnitudes affected by extinction, right? Like dust in the interstellar medium would make them appear dimmer (higher magnitude). Oh, the question mentions that for Star3 and Star4, there's E(B-V) given. So I need to calculate their actual apparent magnitudes after accounting for extinction.

Let
