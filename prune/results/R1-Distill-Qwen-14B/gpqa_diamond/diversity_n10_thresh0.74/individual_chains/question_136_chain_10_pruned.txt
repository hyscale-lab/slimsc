Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my multivariable calculus, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. That means the vector field f is pointing radially outward or inward, and its magnitude decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

The integral we need to evaluate is the volume integral of the divergence of f over the sphere of radius R. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. So, ∇·f would give us a scalar field that's the divergence at each point.

Wait, but I'm supposed to integrate the divergence over the entire volume of the sphere. Hmm, maybe there's a theorem that relates volume integrals of divergence to something on the surface. Oh right! That's the Divergence Theorem, or Gauss's Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a region is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that region. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector on the surface.

Wait, but since the problem is asking for the volume integral, perhaps I should compute it directly, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the flux through the surface and see what that gives. Let me think.

Wait, but wait a minute. The vector field f has a magnitude of 1/r² and only a radial component. So, in spherical coordinates, f(r) can be written as f(r) = (some coefficient) * r̂ / r². Since the magnitude is 1/r², and it's radial, the coefficient must be 1. So, f(r) = r̂ / r².

Wait, but wait again. If the vector field is radial and the magnitude is 1/r², then yes, f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So, in spherical coordinates, this is straightforward.

Now, I need to compute the divergence of f. I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that only has a radial component (i.e., A_θ = 0 and A_φ = 0) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r). So, in this case, A_r is 1/r², so:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] = (1/r²) d/dr [1]. Because r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So, ∇·f = 0.

Wait, that's strange. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin? Because at r=0, the function isn't defined. So, for all points except r=0, ∇·f is zero.

So, if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere (assuming R is not zero), then the volume integral of the divergence over any region that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But wait, our sphere
