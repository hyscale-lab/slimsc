Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles move, their lifetime gets longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is τ₀, which is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So, the observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Right, γ is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But since the particle is moving at a high speed (given the energy is 27 GeV, way higher than its rest mass), v is approximately c. So, we can approximate γ using the relativistic energy formula.

Energy E is gamma times m c squared. So, gamma is E/(m c²). Or wait, E is given in GeV, and mass is also in GeV. Oh, wait, since E = γ m c², then γ = E / (m c²). But since m is given in GeV/c², perhaps the units will cancel out. Let's think.

Wait, the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². The energy E is 27 GeV. So, gamma would be E / (m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91.

So, gamma is approximately 7.91. Therefore, the observed lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.33e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why do we need the lifetime? Because the decay length is important. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, decay length L is v * τ. Since v is approximately c, L ≈ c * τ.

But wait, the question is
