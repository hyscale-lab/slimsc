Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means there's an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane ring. Then, at the 1-position (the same carbon as the aldehyde?), there's a substituent. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, that might mean a CH2 group connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. So, the core is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde (-CHO) group. Attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring (cyclohexyl) and also to an -OH group. So, the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2-cyclohexyl and a -CHO group on the same carbon, and a hydroxyl on the CH2.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, it's cyclohexane-ethynyl, which would be like CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane.

I need to find a reaction pathway to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the steps involved.

First, I should consider what transformations are needed. The ethynyl group is a triple bond, so perhaps we can do some addition or substitution reactions. The target has an aldehyde group and a cyclohexylmethyl group with a hydroxyl.

Wait, how do I get from ethynyl to aldehyde? One common way to introduce an aldehyde group is through oxidation. But wait, maybe the triple bond can be functionalized first.

Alternatively, maybe we can perform a hydration of the triple bond. Let me think: when you have an alkyne, like ethynylcyclohexane, you can add water via acid-catalyzed hydration to form a ketone. Because alkyne hydration typically gives ketones. So, for example, if you have R-C≡C-R', adding water under acidic conditions (like HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O) would give R-C(OH)-C(OH)-R', but wait, no, actually, hydration of an alkyne (triple bond) under acid conditions typically gives a ketone. So, if the triple bond is at the end (like in ethynylcyclohexane), which is a terminal alkyne, adding water would give a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylpropanal? Wait, no, wait. Terminal alkynes (like HC≡C-R) when hydrated give R-C(O)H, that is, a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-C≡CH) would become cyclohexane-C(O)CH3? No, wait, wait. The triple bond is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group. Wait, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, right? So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is CH2-C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH2 group? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's cyclohexane attached directly to the triple bond, like cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. So, the triple bond is at the end. So, when we add water, via acid-catalyzed hydration (like H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O), the triple bond would add an H and OH across it, leading to a ketone.

Wait, not quite. Let me think: terminal alkynes (like HC≡C-R) when hydrated under acidic conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) typically form ketones. The mechanism would be addition of water across the triple bond to form a ketone. So, for ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH), upon hydration, it would form cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H. Wait, that would be a ketone, cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H, but wait, that's not right. Because the addition would put an OH on one side and an H on the other. So, in this case, perhaps the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)-H, but that's a ketone. But wait, the target has an aldehyde group. So, how do we go from a ketone to an aldehyde?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about deprotonation and other reactions. Another approach could be alkyne reduction. For example, using H2 with a catalyst like Pd to reduce the triple bond to a single bond. But wait, the triple bond is in ethynylcyclohexane, which is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, if we reduce the triple bond to CH2-CH2, that would turn it into cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, when reduced with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Reducing the triple bond would give cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? But that would be cyclohexane with a propyl group. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps it's cyclohexane with a CH2CH2CH3 group. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the triple bond is between two carbons, so CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH2 upon hydrogenation? No, wait, hydrogenation would add H across the triple bond. So, the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond (C-C) with two H's added. So, CH2-C≡CH would become CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right. Wait, another thought: if you have CH2-C≡CH and you reduce the triple bond to a single bond, you get CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's more like propyl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The triple bond is between two carbons. So, the group is CH2-C≡CH. Upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that would be a single bond, but perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 if hydrogenated all the way. Wait, no. Let's try to imagine: the triple bond is between two carbons. So, each carbon in the triple bond has two H's when it's a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R). So, when we hydrogenate a triple bond, each carbon gains two more H's, turning it into a single bond with four substituents. Wait, no. Let me think: for a triple bond, each carbon is sp-hybridized. Upon hydrogenation to a single bond, each carbon becomes sp3. So, for the group CH2-C≡CH, when hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the group becomes CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because that would require adding two H's to each carbon of the triple bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the reduction of an alkyne. For example, ethyne (HC≡CH) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd becomes ethane (CH3-CH3). Similarly, if we have CH2-C≡CH, hydrogenation would add H's across the triple bond, turning it into CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, that can't be right because that would imply three CH2 groups. No, wait, the structure is CH2-C≡CH. So the triple bond is between the central carbon and the CH2 group. So, after hydrogenation, the central carbon would have four single bonds: two CH2 groups on either side, and two H's from hydrogenation. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me represent it more clearly.

Structure of ethynylcyclohexane: cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a triple bond (C≡CH). So, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

When we hydrogenate this with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not possible because that would require adding two H's to each carbon of the triple bond. So, maybe it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that would imply three CH2 groups in a row, which isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't seem right because the starting material is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation of the triple bond in CH2-C≡CH would lead to CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would make it a propyl group. Wait, no, that's not correct because the triple bond is between two carbons. So, CH2-C≡CH would after hydrogenation become CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a single bond, so maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a propyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible reactions.

Another approach: perhaps the starting material undergoes elimination or substitution. Alternatively, maybe a Grignard reaction or another nucleophilic addition.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexylmethyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps we can form some kind of substitution where a group is introduced that includes the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a ketone via hydration. Then, we could perform some kind of alkylation to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, let me think again. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The core is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so the aldehyde is at position 1 (assuming the cyclohexane is a six-membered ring). Then, at position 1, there's a CH2 group that's connected to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

So, the target has the structure: cyclohexane with a -CHO group at one carbon and a -CH2-OH and a -CH2-cyclohexyl group also at the same carbon.

Wait, no, more accurately, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a -CH2-OH and a -CH2-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

So, another way to look at it: the carbon that has the aldehyde (-CHO) also has a CH2 group attached, which is further connected to a cyclohexane ring and an -OH group.

So, perhaps to build this, we can start from ethynylcyclohexane, functionalize the triple bond, and then perform some kind of alkylation or oxidation.

Let me consider the steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → something → introduce a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone).

2. Introduce substituents to the same carbon as the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can perform a Grignard reaction. But how?

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be converted into a ketone first. So, if we use acid-catalyzed hydration (like H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O) on ethynylcyclohexane, we'd get a ketone. So, the product would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H. Wait, no, because the starting material is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, hydration would add an H and an OH across the triple bond. Wait, if it's a terminal alkyne (CH2-C≡CH), then hydration would give CH2-C(OH)-CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the hydration of a terminal alkyne. For a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, hydration with H2SO4 and HgSO4 (acidic conditions) would add H and OH across the triple bond, giving R-C(O)-H. So, in the case of ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH), the hydration would give cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H. So, a ketone. Wait, that would make sense. So, the product after hydration would be cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)Me? No, wait, the starting material is CH2-C≡CH, so the product would be CH2-C(O)H. So, after hydration, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H, which is a ketone.

But the target has an aldehyde group, not a ketone. Hmm. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Another approach: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a propargyl alcohol or something else, then oxidized.

Wait, another possibility is that the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde via some other method. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group can be used in a substitution to introduce a new group. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne, maybe we can do a substitution where the triple bond is replaced by an OMe group or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is reduced to a single bond to form a propyl group. Then, perhaps we can perform some kind of oxidation or alkylation.

Wait, let's try this: first, reduce the triple bond to a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane (CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane) becomes CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane. But that's a propyl group. So, the structure would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a single bond, so perhaps we can then perform some kind of oxidation. Like, oxidizing the end of the propyl group to an aldehyde.

Wait, how do you oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde? Typically, you can use oxidizing agents like CrO3 under certain conditions, but that usually goes all the way to carboxylic acid. Alternatively, use a milder oxidizing agent to stop at the aldehyde stage.

But if I have a propyl group attached to cyclohexane, perhaps I can perform an oxidation at the end to make an aldehyde. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but then I need to introduce the cyclohexylmethyl group with a hydroxyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility of adding a cyclohexyl group via some kind of alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is to first reduce the triple bond to a single bond, then perform an oxidation to introduce the aldehyde group, and then perform some kind of addition to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options and see what each sequence does.

Looking at the options:

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O
Wait, that seems to have a typo (two step 3s). Maybe it's a mistake. But I'll note that.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Hmm. So each option has a different sequence. Let's break down what these reagents do.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, especially in elimination reactions. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So step 1 in option A and C is probably an alkylation, maybe adding a methyl group.

Li in liquid NH3 is a strong reducing agent, used for Birch reductions or for dehalogenation, perhaps for elimination reactions. O3 is ozone, used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup after ozonolysis, perhaps to avoid overoxidation.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, could cause elimination or deprotonation, maybe for epoxide openings or for saponification.

H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydration of alkynes to ketones.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group or another substituent.

2. Reduction or hydrogenation.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond.

4. Workup and possibly further reactions.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde and hydroxyl. So perhaps that cyclohexyl group comes from an alkyne being cleaved and then reconnected. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexane is opened via some ring-opening reaction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring with a CH2-C≡CH substituent.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → maybe adds a methyl group to the alkyne.

But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So, perhaps this step is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But where? If the alkyne is terminal, perhaps the proton is abstracted from the sp-hybrid carbon, making it a strong base, and then methyl chloride would methylate it. So, CH2-C≡CH → upon treatment with NaNH2 and CH3Cl, perhaps becomes CH2-C≡CCH3. Wait, that would be a methyl group added to the triple bond. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that's hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding H's. So, the structure would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's a longer chain. But wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (C≡C) would add two H's to each carbon, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 would become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make it a four-carbon chain? No, perhaps that's cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is cyclohexane with a butyl group.

Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. But in this case, after hydrogenation, all double bonds are gone. Wait, unless there's a double bond formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps there's a double bond that I haven't considered. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation step is a different catalyst, or perhaps the initial step forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me go back to the steps.

Another approach: the target requires a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2 group, along with a hydroxyl group on that same CH2. So, perhaps the CH2 group is formed via some kind of cleavage or addition.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then perhaps subjected to some kind of cyclopropanation or alkyne addition to introduce the cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is functionalized to form a carbonyl, then some kind of alkylation introduces the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material (ethynylcyclohexane) is first converted into a propargyl alcohol, then subjected to some reaction to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first reduced to a cis double bond via catalytic hydrogenation with Lindlar's catalyst, then ozonolysis is used to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me think: suppose we hydrogenate the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane to a cis-alkene using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst (which is poisoned to give cis addition). Then, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So, hydrogenation would give CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to cyclohexane, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated in such a way that it becomes a cis double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the steps in option D.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonates something and adds a methyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, which could deprotonate an acidic proton. Methanol is a methylating agent, but in this case, it's the solvent. So maybe it's an alkylation where a methyl group is added.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong reducing agent, perhaps for Birch reduction or for elimination.

Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, which would break double bonds.

Then step 4: NH4OH, which could be a workup or for acid workup.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is adding a methyl group to the alkyne, making it CH2-C≡C-OCH3? No, methanol might not methylate directly. Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol are used for some kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation of the alkyne to form a strong base, which then reacts with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct method is to first perform a hydration of the triple bond to form a ketone, then perform a reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, then oxidize that to an aldehyde. But I'm not sure how the cyclohexyl group would come into play.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the correct option's steps.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct sequence involves:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Reduction of the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde.

Let me think about option C.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation of the alkyne. So, ethynylcyclohexane → (after alkylation) becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 (but attached to cyclohexane). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → reduces the triple bond to a single bond. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. Hmm.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But wait, that requires a double bond. So, unless the previous step forms a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything. Hmm, maybe I'm mistaken about the second step. Wait, the second step is H2 and Pd-calcium carbonate. So, that's a catalyst for hydrogenation, which typically reduces triple bonds to single bonds. So, after hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so the structure would have a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 substituent.

But then, where's the double bond needed for ozonolysis? That doesn't add up. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence involves forming a double bond after alkylation.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about how to introduce the cyclohexyl group. Maybe through a ring-opening or some kind of substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to alkylate the alkyne, making it CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. Then, hydrogenated (H2/Pd) to make CH2-CH2-CH3 attached, but that doesn't form a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first step is adding a methyl group, making CH2-C≡C-CH3, then performing an elimination reaction to form a double bond.

Wait, but after alkylation, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3. Then, perhaps upon treatment with a strong base like NaNH2, it could eliminate to form a double bond. But that seems unlikely unless there's a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a deprotonation and alkylation, forming a substituted alkyne. Then, step 2 is a reduction to form a trans double bond, or maybe a cis double bond.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of a different angle.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring attached via a CH2 group to the same carbon as the aldehyde. That CH2 group also has a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps that CH2 group is formed via some kind of carbonyl addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to a Grignard reaction to add the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, let's think about it step by step.

1. Ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH) is treated with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration to form cyclohexane-CH2-C(O)H, which is a ketone.

2. Then, perhaps perform a reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But that doesn't help in forming an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe perform an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But without a primary alcohol, that's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule's structure again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the aldehyde is at position 1, and the same carbon has a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl substituents.

So, perhaps this CH2 group is formed by some kind of alkylation or addition after forming the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

- Reduce the triple bond to a double bond.

- Then, perform some kind of addition to introduce the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but how do you reduce a triple bond to a double bond? Using H2 with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2 (no, that's when fully hydrogenated). Wait, no, if you use a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, you hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. Reducing it with Lindlar's would give CH2-CH2-CH2? No, perhaps it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't form a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong again. Let's think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a substituent of CH2-C≡CH. So, when you hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond using Lindlar's catalyst, you'd get cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not correct because that's a single bond. Wait, perhaps the product is CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't make a double bond. I think I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative plan: Let's consider the options and their possible outcomes.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylates the alkyne to CH2-C≡C-CH3 (so, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane).

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, so the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but there's no double bond here, so ozonolysis can't occur. So this step wouldn't do anything, which doesn't make sense.

So option C might not be correct.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonates the alkyne and adds a methyl group from methanol. But I'm not sure how this would proceed.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → a strong reducing agent. Maybe it's used for Birch reduction or to reduce a ketone to an alcohol.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which requires a double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup.

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Alkylation of the alkyne.

- Reduction to form a double bond.

- Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

- Workup.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step adds a methyl group, making the alkyne longer, then step 2 forms a double bond, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the correct sequence involves converting the triple bond into a carbonyl group, then introducing the cyclohexyl group via some kind of alkylation.

But I'm not seeing the connection. Let me think about the target again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the same carbon as the aldehyde has a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe the CH2 group is the result of a reduction of a carbonyl group. So, perhaps you first form a ketone, then reduce it to an alcohol, then introduce the cyclohexyl group via some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl (ketone), then subjected to some kind of alkylation to add both the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

But I'm not quite getting it. Let's think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylates the alkyne to make it longer.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps reduces something, maybe the alkyne to a trans double bond.

3. O3/H2O → cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup, perhaps to form aldehydes.

So, let's imagine:

Ethynylcyclohexane → after step 1, becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3 (ethyl group added).

Step 2: Li in NH3 → reduces the triple bond to a trans double bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 (but that's a single bond; no, wait, if you reduce the triple bond to a double bond, it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 reduces the triple bond to a double bond (using Li/NH3?), so it becomes CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So, cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, then step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So, the structure would break into two carbonyls. But the target has only one aldehyde group, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps adds a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent, but maybe in this context, it's used for deprotonation followed by some reaction.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the target again.

The target is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1: a CH2 group bearing a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol. But the primary alcohol would have to be attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → hydration to form a ketone.

2. Reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol.

3. Oxidation of the secondary alcohol to a ketone again? Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an aldehyde directly. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the triple bond is subjected to a cyanohydrin reaction, introducing an alcohol and a nitrile group, which can be further processed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used in a substitution reaction to introduce the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think about each step in the options.

Option C:

After step 1 (NaNH2, methyl chloride), the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. But without a double bond, nothing happens. So this option may not be correct.

Option B:

Step 1: alkylation to make CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → reduces alkyne to a trans double bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond.

Step 3: ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyls. So, the structure would have two carbonyl groups.

But the target only has one aldehyde. Hmm.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2, methanol → perhaps adds a methyl group or hydroxyl.

Not sure. Then, step 2: Li/NH3 → perhaps forms a double bond.

Step 3: ozonolysis → cleaves into carbonyls.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

Not quite seeing it.

Option A:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → adds methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 → strong base, maybe elimination.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

But I'm not sure how this sequence would build the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Perform ozonolysis (but that requires a double bond, so maybe another step forms it).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkylate the alkyne, then reduce it to a double bond, then perform ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then introduce the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Another angle: the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That suggests that the aldehyde is formed from an oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps a primary alcohol is formed by some reduction, then oxidized.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → reduce triple bond to a primary alcohol.

But how? Maybe via hydration to a ketone, then reduction to the secondary alcohol, but that doesn't give a primary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I can't form a primary alcohol directly from ethynylcyclohexane.

Another thought: Maybe the triple bond is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then subjected to some reaction.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should try to look for the correct option based on the reagents.

Looking at the target, the substituent is a cyclohexyl (hydroxymethyl), which suggests that the cyclohexyl group is added via some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a cis-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and introduce the cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a trans-alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups, which are then worked up to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Given all this, I think the correct option is C.

Wait, why? Let me think again.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylates the alkyne, making CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but without a double bond, this step does nothing. So perhaps my earlier assessment is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the step after hydrogenation forms a double bond. How?

Wait, if after alkylation, the structure is CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane, and then step 2 is hydrogenation with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's, which would reduce the triple bond to a cis-double bond.

Wait, but the step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is for full hydrogenation to a single bond. So, that would not leave a double bond.

So, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the correct sequence involves a Grignard reaction after forming a ketone.

So, step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → hydration to ketone.

Step 2: Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

But I don't see any option that includes a Grignard reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps deprotonates and adds a methyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → reduces to form a double bond or something else.

3. Ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's hard to say.

After all this thinking, I'm inclined to choose option C. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option B is the right one.

Wait, option B's steps:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → forms CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/NH3 → perhaps deprotonates and forms a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not sure how that would form the target.

Wait, perhaps after ozonolysis, the molecule is cleaved into two aldehydes, and then the cyclohexyl group is added.

I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1, and the same carbon also bears a CH2 group substituted with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride likely alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: H2/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, possibly for elimination or deprotonation.
   - Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O hydrates the alkyne to form a ketone.
   - However, this sequence does not clearly explain how the aldehyde group and the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group are introduced. Additionally, there appears to be a typo in the steps (two step 3s).

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming a longer chain.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong reducing agent, possibly reducing the alkyne to a cis-alkene.
   - Step 3: O3/H2O cleaves the double bond via ozonolysis, forming carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH4OH likely serves as a workup step.
   - While this sequence introduces carbonyl groups, it does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group is added to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride alkylate the alkyne, forming CH2-C≡C-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
   - Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate reduces the triple bond to a single bond, forming CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to cyclohexane.
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, this step would not cleave anything.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but its role is unclear in this context.
   - This sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule, as ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after step 2.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol likely deprotonate and add a methyl group.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 is a strong reducing agent, possibly forming a double bond.
   - Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S cleaves the double bond via ozonolysis, forming carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH4OH serves as a workup step.
   - This sequence is unclear in how it introduces the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group and the aldehyde.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly explains the formation of the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite some uncertainties in the sequence.
