Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I need to find how N changes with distance. Parallax is related to distance, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, more accurately, plx (in parsecs) is 1/d where d is in parsecs. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So given N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx with 1/d, because plx = 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait, that's the same as d^5. Oh, wait no, wait. Let me recheck. Let me write this out.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx = 1/d. So substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Hmm, but wait, the question is about how N changes with distance—so does that mean the number of stars per unit distance? Or the total number in a range?

Wait, the question says "how does the number
