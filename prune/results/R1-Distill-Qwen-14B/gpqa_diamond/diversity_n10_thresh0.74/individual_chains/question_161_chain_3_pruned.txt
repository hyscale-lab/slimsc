Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to achieve an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The reason for such a vacuum is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam, right? But even then, some gas particles are still present, as detected by the mass spectrometer.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which he called λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the volume of the sample compartment, pressure, and temperature. Wait, I remember that the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the temperature. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure.

So, before the electron beam was initiated, the mean free path was λ1. But when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The temperature remained the same, according to the scenario. So the change in mean free path must be due to something else.

Hmm, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, wait! When the electron beam is active, especially at such high voltages (1000 kV is pretty high), the electrons have a lot of energy. They can interact with the gas molecules in the compartment. 

I think that when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules in the vacuum chamber might get ionized. Because high-energy electrons can knock electrons off gas atoms, creating ions. So, instead of neutral gas molecules, you have charged particles—ions—floating around.

Now, what's the difference between neutral gas molecules and ions in terms of scattering electrons? Well, charged particles (ions) would have a stronger Coulomb interaction with the electron beam. Wait, but electrons have a negative charge, and ions are positively charged. So, the ions would be more likely to scatter the electrons, right? Because the Coulomb force between electrons and ions would be stronger than with neutral molecules.

Wait, but wait. How does that affect the mean free path? The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. If the scattering is more efficient (i.e., higher cross-section for scattering), then the mean free path decreases. Because the particles collide more frequently.

So, if the electron beam is causing more scattering events, then λ2 would be smaller than λ1. Because more collisions mean shorter average path lengths.

But wait, I should think about the factors that influence λ. The mean free path equation is λ = 1/(n*σ), where n is the number density of scattering particles and σ is the scattering cross-section.

In the initial state (before the beam), the particles are neutral gas molecules.
