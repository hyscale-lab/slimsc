Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be a higher energy state. I think in such models, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, the question specifically mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor is a simpler model where the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond vibrations, which probably ties into the vibrational energy as well.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, no, the fundamental state might just be the lowest vibrational state, and the rotational state could be different. Or maybe in the non-rigid rotor, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Wait, no, maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level with v=0 and the lowest rotational J. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0, and the rotational states are separate. So the molecule in the fundamental state would have both v=0 and J=0, I think.

The question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest possible energy state. So what's the next state? The next lowest energy state could either be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy?

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. For vibration, E_vib = (ℏω/2) (2v +1), I think. Or is it (hν/2) or something else? Wait, I remember the harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) hν. So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν.
