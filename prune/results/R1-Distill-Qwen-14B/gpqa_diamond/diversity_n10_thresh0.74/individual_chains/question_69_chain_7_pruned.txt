Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime of τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given in meters, so I think it's about the distance the particles travel before decaying, which relates to the resolution of the detector.

Wait, right. When a particle decays, the particles produced travel some distance before being detected. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when observed from the lab frame, their lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the distance they travel depends on their speed, which is related to their energy.

So, to find the minimum resolution, I think we need to calculate the average distance the particles travel before decaying. Then, the resolution should be such that it can detect this distance, meaning the particles' tracks are longer than the resolution, allowing us to observe the decay.

Wait, but the question is about observing at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, that makes me think about the decay length and the detector's resolution. The probability of observing a decay is related to the ratio of the decay length (how far the particle travels) to the detector's resolution. Or maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's about the fraction of decays that have decay lengths longer than the detector's resolution.

Wait, perhaps the fraction is determined by the decay probability. The decay probability is based on the particle's lifetime and the time it spends before decaying. Since the lifetime is τ, the probability that the particle decays before traveling a certain distance depends on the velocity and the lifetime.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ are produced when X⁰ decays. The X⁰ is moving with a certain velocity when it decays. The lifetime τ is in the X⁰ rest frame. So, from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to gamma (γ) factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), where E is the energy of the X⁰ particle.

Wait, the energy of X⁰ is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. So, gamma would be E/(m c²). Since in natural units, c=1, so gamma = E/m.

So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me compute that: 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 is about 3.41*7=23.87, plus 0.9*3.41=3.069, so 26.939. So 7.9 gives about 26.939 GeV. So 27 is just a bit higher, like about 7.92 or so. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So τ_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So tau_lab = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The lifetime in the lab frame is longer, so the particles Y and Z will travel a longer distance before decaying. But wait, no. The X⁰
