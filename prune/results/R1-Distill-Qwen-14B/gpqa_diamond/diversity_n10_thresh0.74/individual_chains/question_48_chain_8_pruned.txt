Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through each step carefully.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The first step is treating it with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Hmm, when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, I think it's a halohydrin formation, but wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition reaction. Oh right! Cyclohexanone can undergo a halogenation via the enol mechanism. So, bromine adds to the carbonyl group. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, another possibility is that cyclohexanone undergoes a bromination via a different pathway. Wait no, I think when ketones are treated with bromine in a non-polar solvent, it's a addition to the carbonyl group, but maybe more accurately, it's a dihalide addition? Or wait, isn't bromine in a more polar solvent like a ketone's typical environment, which is maybe a ring-opening if it's cyclic ether, but no, cyclohexanone is a ketone. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the opening of the carbonyl group?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha-bromination. Oh wait, but that reaction usually involves carboxylic acids, not ketones. Wait, perhaps it's a different
