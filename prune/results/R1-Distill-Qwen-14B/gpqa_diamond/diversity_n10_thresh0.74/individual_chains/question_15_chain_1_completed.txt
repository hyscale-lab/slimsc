Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit rusty on the factors that affect the probability of a transit happening.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's laws. Oh wait, the period is shorter, so the planet is closer in.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. If a star is more massive, it's usually bigger, but maybe in this case, Planet_1's star hasn't expanded yet because maybe it's younger, while Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might mean it's starting to expand. So, same radii but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out the transit probability formula. I think the probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit relative to the star's distance.

Wait, the transit probability (P) for a planet is roughly (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by something related to the orbital distance. Or was it (R_p / R_s) divided by (a_p / R_s) or something else? Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the impact parameter term.

Wait, maybe I should think about the transit probability formula. From what I remember, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * ( (a_p) / (2 * R_s) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The transit probability depends on whether the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. For a given star and planet, the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a_p / (R_s * sqrt( ... ))).

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_p) / (R_s) ) * (something else). Alternatively, I remember transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p), or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh, right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p). Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the solid angle that allows the planet to pass in front.

Wait, the actual formula, I think, is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (2 / a_p) * (R_s / a_p), no, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the orbital geometry.

Wait, the probability is given by the area where the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight, divided by the total possible area. The planet's orbit is a circle with radius a_p. The area where the planet's disk would cross the star's disk is a circle of radius (a_p - R_s) or something? Wait, no, that's not correct. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a_p ), but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (2 R_s) / a_p ). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) ), which would be (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s). Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the orbital distance in units of the star's radius. So a_p is in terms of R_s.

Wait, let me think about what I should derive. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit relative to the star's size. So, higher probability when the planet is bigger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer in (so a_p is smaller). Because if the planet is in a tighter orbit, the chance that its path crosses our line of sight is higher.

So, the transit probability formula is P ∝ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p), because as a_p increases, the probability decreases. Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p) because a_p is the semi-major axis. Let me make it more precise.

Wait, I found in my notes that the probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (π R_s^2) / (π (a_p)^2) ) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, the area of the orbit is π a_p². The area where the transit can happen is the area of the star, which is π R_s². So the probability would be (R_s² / a_p²) * (R_p² / R_s²) ) = (R_p² / a_p²). So P = (R_p^2) / (a_p^2). But that can't be right because it doesn't include R_s. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, another approach. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from the planet's position to the area of the planet's orbit. So, the area of the star from the planet's perspective is π (R_s / a_p)^2. The area of the planet's orbit is π a_p^2. So the probability is (π (R_s^2 / a_p^2)) / (π a_p^2) ) = (R_s^2) / (a_p^4). But that seems unlikely. I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p). Let me think in terms of geometry. The planet transits when its orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The condition for a transit is that the planet's orbital distance a_p must be such that the planet's path across the star is possible. The probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

Alternatively, the formula I found somewhere is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a_p ). Because a_p is the semi-major axis, so when a_p is smaller, the probability is higher. Let me see if that makes sense. For a planet close in (small a_p), higher chance of transit. For a larger planet (R_p bigger), higher probability. For a larger star (R_s bigger), lower probability.

Yes, that makes sense. So P ∝ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

Wait no, if P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p), then for larger a_p, P decreases, which is correct. For smaller R_p, P decreases. For larger R_s, P decreases, which is correct.

So the formula is P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've heard it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), which would be (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s). That matches what I just thought.

So, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

So, the probability depends on the planet's radius squared, divided by the star's radius times the planet's semi-major axis.

But wait, in the question, they have given the radii of the host stars. So, for each planet, I can compute their transit probability using this formula.

Wait, but in the question, do we know the radii of the planets? No, we don't. The question says both planets have the same mass, but their radii aren't provided. Hmm, but the formula includes R_p, the planet's radius. Since the question doesn't give R_p for either planet, perhaps the ratio of transit probabilities can be determined without knowing the exact R_p.

Wait, wait. If the two planets have the same mass, but their radii can vary. But since the question is about transit probability, which depends on planet's size, perhaps the problem assumes that both planets have the same radius? Or maybe the transit probability is based on the planet-to-star radius ratio, which might be different for each system.

Wait, the question states that both planets have the same masses. But mass doesn't directly translate to radius because planets can have different densities. But without knowing their radii, the problem might not require their actual R_p values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and assuming other factors are the same, except for a_p and R_s.

Wait, the options don't involve knowing the exact R_p, so perhaps the formula doesn't directly require R_p. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, but since R_p is same for both planets (same mass but not necessarily the same radius—wait, same mass but different composition could have same radius, but the question doesn't state that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question says the planets have the same mass, but perhaps I don't need their individual radii because I'm comparing the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2 for each planet. But without knowing R_p, perhaps the question is implying that R_p is the same for both planets. Because if they have the same mass but different radii, that complicates things, but since the question doesn't specify, perhaps I'm to assume R_p is same for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p) as I thought earlier. So, given that, I can compute the ratio of P1 to P2.

Let me denote the parameters:

For Planet_1:
- Mass same as Planet_2: M_p1 = M_p2
- Period P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is three times shorter than P2)
- Host star mass M_s1 = 2 M_s2
- Host star radii R_s1 = R_s2 = same.

Wait, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) a³. But since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate P² ∝ a³ / M_s.

So, for Planet_1 and Planet_2, P1 = P2 / 3.

So, (P1)^2 / (P2)^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

But P² ∝ a³ / M_s.

So, (a1³ / M_s1) / (a2³ / M_s2) ) = (P1²) / (P2²) ) = 1/9.

So, (a1³ / (2 M_s2)) ) / (a2³ / M_s2) ) = 1/9.

Simplify:

(a1³) / (2 M_s2) ) * ( M_s2 / a2³ ) ) = 1/9.

So, (a1³) / (2 a2³) ) = 1/9.

Multiply both sides by 2:

a1³ / a2³ = 2/9.

Take cube root:

a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So, a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is P1 and P2.

Assuming that the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a_p ), but earlier I thought it might be (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p). Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) ) = (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a_p) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p).

Wait, assuming that the probability P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (R_s a_p ), then for each planet:

P1 = (R_p1²) / ( R_s1 a1 )

P2 = (R_p2²) / ( R_s2 a2 )

Since both planets have same mass, but R_p could be different. But the question doesn't specify R_p, so perhaps the problem is assuming that R_p is the same for both. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the given information and I'm missing it.

Wait, the question doesn't give R_p for the planets. Hmm. So perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that the planet-to-star radius ratio is the same for both, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, the host stars have same radius R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

Because the host stars have same radii.

So, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So, in the transit probability formula, R_s is the same for both.

So, P1 = (R_p1^2) / ( R_s a1 )

P2 = (R_p2^2) / ( R_s a2 )

So, the ratio P1/P2 = (R_p1² / a1) / ( R_p2² / a2 ) )

But since we don't know R_p1 and R_p2, but we know the masses are the same. But mass doesn't directly tell us about radius. So, perhaps this approach is not feasible.

Wait, but the question states that both planets have the same mass, but I don't know their radii. So, unless they have the same radius, which isn't given, I can't compare R_p1 and R_p2.

Hmm, perhaps the question is making an assumption that for the same mass, the radius is the same. But that's not necessarily true. Or perhaps the question is considering only the (R_p/R_s)^2 term, and not involving a_p. But that can't be right because the a_p affects the probability.

Alternatively, maybe the transit probability is independent of a_p. No, that doesn't make sense because closer planets have higher transit probabilities.

Wait, there's another possible approach. The transit probability can also be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p), which is (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s). Since R_s is the same for both, the ratio of probabilities is (R_p1^2 / a1) / (R_p2^2 / a2) ).

But without knowing R_p1 and R_p2, it's impossible to compute this ratio.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question gives that both planets have the same mass, but host stars with same radii. So, perhaps the transit probability is higher for the planet with a smaller a_p, because it's closer in, making it more likely to transit.

But with the same R_s, but different a_p.

Wait, but what's the formula again? Let me check another source in my mind. Oh, another formula I remember is the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter term.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the planet's orbital distance relative to the star's size. The probability is highest when the planet's orbital distance is small compared to the star's size. So, a_p being smaller would increase the probability.

Wait, but in this case, a1 is about 0.6 times a2. So, a1 is smaller, meaning Planet_1 is closer. So, for the same R_p and R_s, Planet_1 would have a higher transit probability because a_p is smaller.

But R_p is not the same. Oh, wait, the problem says both have same mass, which doesn't directly give R_p, but perhaps for the same mass, the radius is the same? No, because a more massive planet can have a larger radius but same mass if it's less dense, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide R_p for either planet. So, perhaps the question is considering only the (R_p / R_s)^2 term, but that's not the case because a_p is also a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that for the same mass, the radius is same. Because if two planets have same mass, perhaps their radii are the same, assuming same composition. So, R_p1 = R_p2.

If that's the case, then the ratio of probabilities P1/P2 = (R_p1² / (R_s a1 )) / (R_p2² / (R_s a2 )) ) = (a2) / (a1 ), since R_p1=R_p2 and R_s same.

From earlier, a1/a2 ≈ 0.606. So, a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So, P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) ≈ 1.65.

Which would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. But wait, according to the options, which option says that?

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times.

So, according to this, the probability of Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of ~1.65. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

But wait, the initial formula I used assumed that R_p is same for both. But the question doesn't state that. So perhaps this assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is only dependent on (R_p / R_s)^2. But that can't be right because a_p also affects the probability. So, without knowing R_p, perhaps the question is making another approximation.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the transit probability formula again.

Another source says that the probability of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) )

Which simplifies to P = (R_p²) / ( a_p R_s )

So, as before.

So, for each planet, P1 and P2.

Given that R_s is the same for both (since both host stars have same radius), the ratio P1/P2 is (R_p1² / a1) / (R_p2² / a2) )

But since we don't know R_p1 and R_p2, we can't directly compute this.

Wait, but the problem states that both planets have the same mass. But mass doesn't directly give radius. So, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the (R_p / R_s)^2 term is the same for both, implying R_p1 = R_p2, which would make sense only if the planets have the same radius, which we don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming that the planets have the same radius, so R_p1 = R_p2.

If that's the case, then the ratio P1/P2 is (1/a1)/(1/a2) ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So, P1 is 1.65 times P2, so Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So, researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Given P1 is 1/3 of P2's period, so P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M_s.

So, for Planet_1, P1 = P2/3.

So, (P1)^2 = (P2/3)^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So, (a1^3 / M_s1) = (a2^3 / M_s2) * (P1^2 / P2^2) )

Wait, let's be precise.

From Kepler's law, (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M_s + M_p)) ≈ 4π²/(G M_s).

Assuming M_p is negligible.

So, P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s.

So, for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

(P1^2) / (a1^3) = (P2^2) / (a2^3) ) * ( M_s2 / M_s1 )

Because M_s1 is 2 M_s2.

So,

(P1^2) / (a1^3) = (P2^2) / (a2^3) ) * ( M_s2 / (2 M_s2) ) )

Simplify:

(P1^2)/(a1^3) = (P2^2)/(a2^3) * (1/2).

But P1 = P2/3.

So,

( (P2/3)^2 ) / a1^3 = (P2^2)/(a2^3) * (1/2 )

Divide both sides by P2^2:

(1/9) / a1^3 = 1/(a2^3) * (1/2 )

Multiply both sides by a2^3 * 9:

a2^3 = ( a1^3 * 9 ) / 2.

Take both sides to the power 1/3.

a2 = a1 * (9/2)^(1/3).

Which is a2 = a1 * (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65.

So, a1 = a2 / 1.65 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So, a1 is about 0.606 a2.

Which brings us back to the ratio a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So, if R_p is same, P1/P2 = a2/a1 = 1.65. So, P1 is 1.65 times P2. So, Planet_1 has higher probability.

Therefore, the researchers should prefer Planet_1, and the correct option is C.

Wait, but another thought: the star's mass affects the Hill sphere or the planet's orbit, but I think I've accounted for that in the Kepler's law calculation.

So, the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s a_p}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a_p \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. The key factors affecting transit probability are the planet-to-star radius ratio \((R_p / R_s)^2\) and the orbital distance \( a_p \). A smaller \( a_p \) increases the probability, while a larger \( R_p \) or smaller \( R_s \) also enhances it.

### Given Information:
1. **Planet_1 and Planet_2** have the same mass but unknown radii.
2. **Planet_1** has an orbital period three times shorter than **Planet_2** (\( P_1 = P_2 / 3 \)).
3. The host star of **Planet_1** has twice the mass of the host star of **Planet_2** (\( M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2} \)).
4. Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{s1} = R_{s2} = R_s \)).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Distances Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_s}
\]

For **Planet_1** and **Planet_2**:

\[
\frac{P_1^2}{a_1^3} = \frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{M_{s2}}{M_{s1}}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = P_2 / 3 \) and \( M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2} \):

\[
\frac{(P_2 / 3)^2}{a_1^3} = \frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{P_2^2}{9 a_1^3} = \frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Cancel \( P_2^2 \) and rearrange:

\[
\frac{1}{9 a_1^3} = \frac{1}{2 a_2^3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Comparing Transit Probabilities
The transit probability for each planet is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_p^1^2}{R_s a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R_p^2^2}{R_s a_2}
\]

Taking the ratio:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R_p^1^2 / a_1}{R_p^2^2 / a_2}
\]

Assuming the planets have the same radius (\( R_p^1 = R_p^2 \)):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, **Planet_1** has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of **Planet_2**.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prefer observing **Planet_1**, as it has a higher transit probability (~1.65 times) compared to **Planet_2**.
