Okay, so I have this question about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there's a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit two lighter particles E and V each. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's noted that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous with some endpoint value Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes in this variant compared to the original decay.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy distribution of emitted particles can depend on whether the particles are massive or massless, and the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original decay, each E and V must carry some energy. Since the E particles have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that they can take a range of energies, but not beyond a certain maximum, the endpoint Q. So in the original scenario, the E's are part of a system where each E and V have some energy, and the total energy plus masses must be conserved.

Wait, but wait. The original decay produces 2E and 2V. I'm assuming E and V are charged particles, maybe electrons and neutrinos or something like that. But in the variant, instead of 2V, we have 1M. And M is massless. Oh, and I guess M is another type of particle, maybe a neutrino or similar.

So let me think about the original decay. The E particles are emitted, and their energies form a continuous spectrum. That's because when you have a system where particles can share energy, and their energies are variable, you get a continuous spectrum. For example, in beta decay, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum up to a maximum energy, determined by conservation of energy and momentum.

In the original case, there are 2E and 2V. So the system's total energy is fixed, but the E and V can share the energy. But why is the E's spectrum continuous? Maybe because the V's are sharing energy with them. So each E can have a range of energies as the V's adjust their energies.

Now, in the variant, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Wait no, wait. The original is 2E and 2V. The variant has 2E and 1M. Because the problem states, "instead of the 2V" so 2V are replaced by 1M. So the total number of particles is 2E + 1M, but wait that's 3 particles, but the original had 4 (2E + 2V). Hmm, maybe I'm misreading it.

Wait, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So 2E and 2V. The variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, instead of two V's, there's one M.

So the number of emitted particles has changed. Now, the question is about the spectrum of E's in the variant.

In the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. That implies that each E can vary in energy, but the maximum occurs when... perhaps when the other E's and V's take as little energy as possible. But with the V's being massless or not? Wait, the problem says that in the variant, the M is massless. What about the V in the original decay? Are the V's massless? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. So maybe I should assume that the V's are massless, but in the variant, M is massless as well.

Wait, the original problem says that the E and V are much lighter particles. So probably, V is a light particle, perhaps massless. So in the original, each V is massless, and
