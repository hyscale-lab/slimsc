Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a certain "size estimate" written next to it. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The task is to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

I remember that Feynman diagrams with loops contribute to loop diagrams in perturbation theory. The number of loops is related to the order of the expansion and the divergence of integrals. Each loop typically brings in factors of the coupling constants and possibly some momentum integrals.

Let me think about the structure of loop integrals. Each loop integral can be approximated in four-dimensional spacetime. The general form after integrating momenta often involves factors of the momentum cutoff, but in regularization methods (like dimensional regularization), these might appear differently.

Wait, the expression given has factors like (4pi)^something. I think that (4pi)^epsilon comes from the angular integration in d dimensions, especially in dimensional regularization where d=4-2epsilon. But not sure how that directly ties in here.

Let me think about the typical scaling of loop integrals. For a diagram with L loops, the integral typically scales with some momentum powers. The number of loops affects the power of the coupling constants as well. For example, each loop brings in a certain number of coupling factors, depending on the interaction.

The given expression includes alpha^3 and g^2. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, approximately 1/137, and is related to the electromagnetic coupling. g is probably a coupling constant from another interaction, maybe like the strong force.

Wait, but how do these factors relate to the number of loops? Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes factors of the coupling constants. For example, a tree-level diagram (no loops) has zero loops and no coupling factors beyond the vertices. Each loop can add a certain number of couplings.

Wait, but this might depend on the theory. For example, in QED, a one-loop diagram might have an alpha factor. But in other theories, like Yang-Mills or QCD, it's different.

Alternatively, I should think about the superficial degree of divergence, which relates the number of loops to the integral's divergence.
