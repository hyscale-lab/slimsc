Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. The options are given as A) 12.62, B) 1.38, C) 8.92, D) 8.68.

Hmm, so the first thing I remember is that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, I think I need to figure out how much of each of these is present and see if they neutralize each other.

Let me think about the steps. I think the process is as follows: calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see if they react with each other, neutralizing as much as possible, and then find out what's left. Then, depending on whether acid or base is in excess, calculate the pH accordingly.

First, let me calculate the moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So moles = M * liters.
But wait, the volume is in mL, so I need to convert that to liters. 500 mL is 0.5 L.
Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

For HCl:
Volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L.
Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

For Ba(OH)₂:
Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH⁻ ions. Let me calculate the moles first. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M, so moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Since each Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH⁻, the total moles of OH⁻ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but wait a second. Ba(OH)₂ is a base, and HCl and CH3COOH are acids. So when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH⁻ ions from the base.

But I should also note that CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, providing H+ ions.

So, the total H+ from the acids comes from HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH. But wait, in the presence of a strong
