Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric since it's in dx and dy. So this is probably a 2-dimensional spacetime, right? But the question mentions a pseudosphere, which I remember is a surface with constant negative curvature. Oh wait, but pseudosphere in 2D would be a hyperbolic space, I think.

Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to the tractricoid, which is a surface in 3D with constant negative curvature. But in the context of the metric given, it's a 2D space maybe embedded in some higher-dimensional space? Or perhaps it's a 2D hyperbolic plane.

So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, the pseudosphere in 2D is the hyperbolic plane. So the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2 would be like the area in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, hyperbolic space is unbounded, so the area would be infinite? Or maybe it's a finite surface, like a sphere.

Wait, the options include D) +infty. So perhaps the area is infinite. But I need to be careful.

Alternatively, maybe the metric given is for a 2-sphere, but no, the metric here doesn't look like the standard sphere metric. Let me think: the standard metric for a 2-sphere in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + r² dθ², but this is flat compared to what's given here.

Wait, the given metric's coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). That denominator looks similar to (R² - x² - y²) where R is a constant. Oh, because for a sphere of radius R, the metric in 3D would have terms like (R² - r²), but here it's in 2D. So perhaps this is a metric for a 2D space with some curvature.

Alternatively, this might be a metric for a de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space, but in 2D. Wait, no—de Sitter is usually in higher dimensions and has a cosmological constant.

Wait, let's consider the line element. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me think about how to compute the area. Area in a 2D metric is computed by integrating the volume form, which is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

In this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². Since both are multiplied by the same factor, [32/(4 - x² - y²)], the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. Wait, no, wait: because it's in 2D, the volume form is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. For a metric diag(A, B), determinant is AB. So here, A = B = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so det g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, but what's the area? Hmm, but I'm not sure about the limits of integration. Because the denominator is 4 - x² - y², that suggests that the domain where the metric is defined is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, so x² + y² <4. So the area is the integral over the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area A would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of sqrt(det g) dx dy.

Wait, no, sqrt(det g) is the volume form. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, integrated over x² + y² <4.

Wait, because sqrt(g) would be sqrt( (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 ) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Oh right, because A is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] for both dx and dy, so det g is that squared, and sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area is ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, switching to polar coordinates.

So integrating over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r dr]/(4 - r²).

Let's compute this:

First, integrate over θ. ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

Then the radial integral: ∫0 to 2 [r dr]/(4 - r²).

Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So (r dr) = -(du)/2.

When r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 [ (-du/2) / u ] = (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (du / u).

Wait, that's (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to 4.

But wait, when u approaches 0, ln u approaches minus infinity. So the integral diverges. Oh no! That would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, but the denominator is 4 - r², which approaches zero as r approaches 2. So the integrand [r/(4 - r²)] approaches infinity as r approaches 2. Hence, the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 would diverge because near r=2, the integrand behaves like 1/(4-r²) ~ 1/(4 -4) = 1/0, which is problematic.

So the area integral is divergent, leading the area to be infinite. So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, but I thought pseudospheres are compact surfaces. Wait, no—pseudosphere as a tractricoid is a finite area, but it's a surface of revolution with infinite length. But here, the question is about the area in the metric given.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again: the metric given is ds²= [32/(4−x²−y²)] (dx² + dy²). So it's a 2D metric; hence, the space is 2-dimensional. The term 'pseudosphere' may refer to the 2D space with constant negative curvature. So a pseudosphere in 2D is a hyperbolic disk. But hyperbolic disks have finite area if considered up to a certain radius, but in reality, hyperbolic space is infinite.

Wait, no, the area of a hyperbolic disk of radius r is 2π (cosh r -1). But in our case, the radius is 2, so area would be 2π (cosh 2 -1). But that's a finite area. But this contradicts the previous calculation where the area integral diverges.

Wait, maybe the metric given is not the standard hyperbolic metric. Let me check. The standard hyperbolic metric in 2D can be written, for example, in Poincaré coordinates as ds² = [4/( (1 + (x² + y²)/4 )² ) ] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that's different from what we have here. Alternatively, in the Beltrami-Klein model, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is conformally flat. Hmm.

Wait, but the calculation I did earlier suggested that the area diverges. Let me recheck the steps.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy, where det g is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So the square root is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area is ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ integrated over r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

Wait, when r approaches 2, 4 - r² approaches 0, so the integrand [32 r/(4 - r²)] becomes very large. So the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute this integral explicitly. ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/u] (-1/2) du) = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0):

At r=2, u=0 → ln(0) → -infinity.

So the integral from 0 to 2 is (-1/2)[ ln 0 - ln 4 ] = (-1/2) [ (-inf) - ln4 ] → which is positive infinity.

So the area is 32 * 2π * ∞ → infinity. So the area is infinite.

Hmm, that suggests the answer is D) +infty. But the question is about a pseudosphere with radius 2. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming the radius of the pseudosphere. Or maybe the pseudosphere in this context refers to a different object.

Wait, perhaps the given metric isn't representing a pseudosphere. Let me think about the metric. The coefficient [32/(4 - x² - y²)] suggests that as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, which implies that the curvature becomes infinite there. So the space might have a singularity at x² + y² =4.

So the region where x² + y² <4 is a disk of radius 2, and the metric is defined within that disk. So the space is a 2D surface that looks like a sphere but with a different scaling.

Wait, but in 2D, a sphere is a circle, and a pseudosphere might refer to a hyperbolic plane, which is non-compact and has infinite area. But according to the metric, the area is infinite because the integral diverges. So the area is indeed infinite, which would mean the answer is D.

Looking at the options:

A) 0 → No, that's not possible.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That's a function varying with x and y, but area should be a number, so this seems incorrect.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue as B. Not a number.

D) +infty → Seems correct based on our calculation.

So the answer must be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the volume form \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and the volume form becomes 

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

The area is then given by the integral of the volume form over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) implies that the space is only defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), i.e., within a disk of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \). The radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) is evaluated using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), giving:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln u \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges. This means the area is infinite. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area cannot be zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area should be a constant, not a function of \( x \) and \( y \).
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, same reason as above.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

Answer: D
