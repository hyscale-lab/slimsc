Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations. But I'll try to tackle it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A through D, with various pH values.

Hmm. So I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. The key here is to figure out the excess acid or base after all possible neutralization reactions. Once I know which is in excess, I can calculate the pH based on that.

First, I'll need to find out how many moles of each substance are present.

Let me calculate the moles for each solution.

1. For the acetic acid (CH3COOH):
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid. But in this case, since it's reacting with a strong base (Ba(OH)2), I think it's treated as a monoprotic acid. So each mole of CH3COOH can donate one H+.

2. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole will donate one H+. The volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 liters. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Barium hydroxide dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 liters. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each mole gives two OH-, so total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when acids and bases are mixed, they react. So the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base.

But wait, the solution has both H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- from Ba(OH)2. So the reaction would be between H+ and OH-.

Wait, no, actually, I think the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react with the strong acid (HCl) first, and then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). Or maybe all the strong acid and base react first, and see what's left, then any excess affects the solution.

Let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so its H+ isn't as readily available. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba²+ and OH-.

So all the H+ from the HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react first. Because HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all its H+ regardless. So the H+ from HCl (0.08 moles) and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles) will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ available: 0.08. Moles of OH- available: 0.18. So the H+ will be neutralized, and there will be excess OH-.

Let me calculate the neutralization. The reaction is 1:1.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Moles of OH-: 0.18.

So 0.08 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. There's also the acetic acid, which is another source of H+ (but as a weak acid). So the remaining OH- (0.10 moles) will react with the acetic acid.

But the acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. When OH- is present, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

The reaction would be: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- can neutral
