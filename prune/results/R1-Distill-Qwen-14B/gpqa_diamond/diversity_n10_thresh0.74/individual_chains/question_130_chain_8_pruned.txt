Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We're supposed to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But ground-based telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the emission is in UV, it can't be observed from the ground unless it's redshifted into the optical range. Oh right, that makes sense.

So the idea is that the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, in the far UV. But if the cloud is moving away (or more precisely, the quasar's light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe), then the absorption line shifts into a longer wavelength. If that shifted wavelength falls into the optical range, which is longer than about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), then ground-based telescopes can see it.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. Wait, actually, the formula is z = λ_obs / λ_rest - 1. Or sometimes written as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z).

Right, so to have the observed wavelength be in the optical (say, above 400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), we set λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms.

The rest wavelength λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms. So, 4000 Angstroms = 1216 * (1 + z). Let me solve for z.

Divide both sides by 1216: 4000 / 1216 = (1 + z). Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Hmm, 1216 times 3 is 3648, and 4000-3648=352. So 3 + 352/1216 ≈ 3.289. So 4000/1216 ≈ 3.289. So 1 + z ≈ 3.289, so z ≈ 2.289.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So when the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms, that gives the minimal z. Because any higher z would shift the wavelength further into the optical, making it observable.

So the minimal z is about 2.289, which is approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is
