Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about what happens when a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other, producing two positive and two negative particles of some sort. The given reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. 

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, so it's moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light. That probably means we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics, right? Because if it's moving slowly, relativistic effects might be negligible. But wait, the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I'm not sure if that's directly relevant right now.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So, I need to find the velocity v of each A particle. Let me think about conservation laws here. Since this is a particle physics problem, I should consider conservation of energy and momentum.

In the center-of-momentum frame, things are symmetric, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, the initial setup—what's the initial state? We have a proton and an antiproton. The proton is presumably at rest, or maybe the system is such that the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, implying that the proton is at rest. Or perhaps it's the other way around; maybe the initial
