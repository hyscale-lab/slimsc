Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli matrices vector, right? So each component of sigma is a Pauli matrix.

Wait, Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So the vector σ is (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). And n is a unit vector, so it's a direction in space. So H = ε σ · n. So, this is like a spin Hamiltonian, maybe something like the Zeeman term?

The question is about the eigenvalues of H. I remember that eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix product with a unit vector relate to their spin. Let me think. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? But when you take a linear combination, like σ · n, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, what's the eigenvalue there?

Wait, the dot product σ · n is a matrix. So when you multiply it by ε, the eigenvalues would scale by ε. But what are the eigenvalues of σ · n without the ε?

I think for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and the combination in that direction would have the same. Because the dot product is essentially the spin in the direction of n, which can be up or down, hence eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So if the operator is epsilon times that, then the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon. Because each eigenvalue gets multiplied by epsilon. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is plus epsilon and minus epsilon. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, wait. Did I forget anything? Oh, no, because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -I, so their eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So when you have σ ·n, the eigenvalues are ±1, multiplied by ε gives ±ε. So yes, option B is correct.

I think that's it. So the answer is option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the vector of Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are known to be \( \pm 1 \), as the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \) and their linear combination in the direction of \( \vec{n} \) preserves this property.

When scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This corresponds to the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian being \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as explained above.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues do not include \( \hbar/2 \).  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as this does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
