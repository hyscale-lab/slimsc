Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and cosmological parameters. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object in an expanding universe, considering the universe's expansion history. The question gives me a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. Wait, but how does this relate to the comoving distance?

Oh right! The peak mentioned is probably the Lyman-alpha emission line, which for quasars is usually around 121 nm in the rest frame. But if it's observed at 790 nm, that must mean it's been redshifted. So the observed wavelength is longer, which implies the quasar is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.

Let me calculate the redshift, z. Redshift is given by z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So rest wavelength is 121 nm. Observed is 790 nm.

So z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtracting 1 gives z ≈ 5.5289. So z is about 5.53.

Now, I need to find the comoving distance (D_C) to the quasar. The cosmological parameters given are Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0).

The formula for comoving distance in a flat universe is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). 

So E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7). 

But integrating this from 0 to z isn't straightforward. I remember that there's an approximation or maybe a table for comoving distances based on given z with these parameters.

Alternatively, I might recall that for a given redshift, the comoving distance can be found using an online calculator or standard cosmology tables. But since I can't look those up, I need to think of another way.

Wait, another approach: in a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z≈5.5 can be approximated. I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases significantly.

I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is roughly around 1.6 billion light-years, but that's in terms of proper distance. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units right. Wait, comoving distance is in units of Mpc. Let me think about some standard values.

Wait, I think for the given cosmology (H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, flat), the comoving distance at z=5 is about 15 billion parsecs. Wait, 1 Gpc is 1000 Mpc. So 15 Gpc would be 15,000 Mpc. Or wait, I might have that wrong.

Wait, another way: Hubble's law, but that's only valid for small z. For z=5, it's not applicable. So perhaps I should think about using the lookback time or other methods.

Alternatively, I remember that the comoving distance for high z can be approximated. Let me try to think about the integral.

E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). So the integrand is 1/E(z) = 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

The integral from 0 to z of this is
