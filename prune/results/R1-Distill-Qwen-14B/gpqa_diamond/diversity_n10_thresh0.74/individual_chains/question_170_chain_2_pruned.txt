Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron in a given spin state. Hmm, I remember that the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? Or maybe it's a column vector. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spins are usually represented as two-component vectors since electrons are spin-1/2 particles.

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. So I think the formula for the expectation value is the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the state. But wait, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y.

Let me write down what I know. The state vector is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, which is the bra, would be <ψ| = [ -3, 4i ].

The σ_y matrix is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

To find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>. So substituting S_y, that becomes (ħ/2) times <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

So let's compute this step by step. First, compute σ_y |ψ>.

Let me write this out. σ_y times the vector [3i,4]^T.
