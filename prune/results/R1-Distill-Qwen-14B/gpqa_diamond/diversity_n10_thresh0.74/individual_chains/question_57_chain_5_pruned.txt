Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and I'm supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are different values in fm, so I'm guessing it's a calculation involving these phase shifts.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) ] e^{ilθ} }, but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh right! The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

Wait, another approach: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) ) multiplied by some factors. Let me recall the exact formula.

Oh, right! The imaginary part of f(0) is ( (1/(k)) ) times the sum from l=0 to L of (2l+1) sin(δ_l), where k is the wave number. Wait, but wait, what about the denominator? Does it come into play here? Or is it that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is directly this sum times some constants?

Wait, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (forward direction) is given by ( (k/(2π)) ) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ) * something. Or maybe I'm getting confused with the Born approximation.

Alternatively, I remember that the total cross-section is given by σ_total = 4π ∑ |f_l|^2, where f_l is the partial wave amplitude. But wait, that's for the cross-section. But here, the question is about the scattering amplitude's imaginary part.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f can be written as f(θ,φ) = Σ ( (
