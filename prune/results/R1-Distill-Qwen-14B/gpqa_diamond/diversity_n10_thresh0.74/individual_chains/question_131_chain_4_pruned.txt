Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

So the question is about a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, which gives two products: a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product's NOESY spectrum has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to find out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about these reactions. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene would likely form an anhydride, probably a cyclic one since that's common. The structure of the anhydride isn't given, but the NMR data might help. The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is pretty deshielded. For 13C, there are two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. That 165 is probably a carbonyl, like an anhydride or ester. The 137 is maybe a carbonyl-adjacent carbon, like a CH next to an oxygen. Wait, 13C NMR of anhydrides typically have carbonyls around 165-185 ppm. The 137 could be a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a CH2 or CH group.

But the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all protons are equivalent in that environment. Maybe it's a bridgehead proton or something in a symmetric situation. Wait, for example, if the anhydride is a cyclic structure like a five-membered ring, maybe a maleic anhydride type structure but perhaps more symmetric. Wait, but the starting material was a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, the geometry might influence the structure of the anhydride.

Wait, another approach: the anhydride's 1H NMR has a singlet at 7 ppm, integrating for how many protons? Wait, the question doesn't specify, but the options for the products do. Hmm, but the anhydride's NMR info might help us figure out its structure, which in turn will help when considering the reaction with the cyclopentadiene.

The reaction between the anhydride and the cyclopentadiene probably involves a Diels-Alder reaction. Because 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene, and the anhydride would have a dienophile, like a carbonyl group. Anhydrides can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. So the cyclopentadiene (which is 1,3-cyclopentadiene here) would react with the anhydride via [4+2] cycloaddition.

Wait, but the cyclopentadiene given is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let me draw that structure. So the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have conjugated double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. But the molecule is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl
