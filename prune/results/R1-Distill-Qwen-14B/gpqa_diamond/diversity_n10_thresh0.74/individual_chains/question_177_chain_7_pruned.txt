Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are given too—Star_1 is moving at 0 km/s, and Star_2 at 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity ratio between the two stars, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since they're black bodies, that formula should apply here.

Wait, but the problem gives the masses of the stars. How does mass relate to luminosity and temperature? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, well, maybe the mass isn't directly needed for this particular calculation since the problem is about black body radiation and we're given other parameters. But wait, why is the mass mentioned then? Hmm, maybe it's a red herring or perhaps it's used in a different way. Well, the problem says the luminosity should be computed based on black body radiation, so maybe mass isn't needed here. I'll proceed under that assumption for now.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T is the same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. So the temperatures are equal.

So, using the Stefan-Boltzmann formula, L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Because R1 is 1.5 R2, that would make (1.5
