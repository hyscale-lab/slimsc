Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total and is a di-substituted aromatic ring. So, the aromatic ring itself has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more carbons. Wait, because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 substituents would make 8. So each substituent must contribute one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has one? Hmm, not sure yet.

The FTIR peaks show a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule has both a carbonyl and a halogen substituent on the aromatic ring. That makes sense. So the substituents are probably a halogen (like Cl or Br) and a carbonyl group, maybe as an ester or ketone.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how substituents affect the ring. For a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in different positions. Common di-substituted rings are para, ortho, or meta. But para is more common when the substituents are similar, but in this case, they're different: one is a halogen, the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the carbonyl could be part of a substituent attached to the ring. For example, maybe one substituent is a -COOR group (like an ester) and another is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group like a ketone (-COR), but that's less likely because ketones are usually not very activating for substitution. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group attached via an oxygen (like an ether), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene and the substituents add up to 2 carbons, perhaps one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is one carbon but doesn't add any carbons) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group with one carbon, like an acetyl group.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are Cl and something else with 1 carbon, the total would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (Cl doesn't add a carbon) + 1 (from the other substituent) = 8. Oh wait, but Cl is a substituent but doesn't add a carbon. So perhaps the other substituent is a carbonyl group attached via a single carbon. For example, maybe a formyl group (-CHO) or an acetyl group (-COCH3). Let's see.

Wait, a formyl group is -CHO, which is one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) attached to the ring. So, substituents would be Cl and CHO. That would make the molecule's structure with two substituents: one Cl and one CHO group. So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (from CHO
