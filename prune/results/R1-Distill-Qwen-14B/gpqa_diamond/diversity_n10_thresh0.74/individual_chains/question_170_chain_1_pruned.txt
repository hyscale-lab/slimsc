Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4). Hmm, wait, I think that notation means the spinor is [3i, 4]T, right? So it's a two-component vector. 

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. So for the spin in the y-direction, the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma y matrix. Oh wait, the question already gives the sigma y matrix as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So I can write S_y as (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

The spinor given is (3i, 4), but since it's a vector, I think it's a column vector. So to compute the expectation value, I need to take the conjugate transpose of the spinor, multiply it by S_y, and then multiply by the spinor itself. 

Let me write down the steps:

1. The spinor ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i), 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Because the complex conjugate changes i to -i. So the first component is 3i; its conjugate is -3i. But ψ† is a row vector, so when you take the conjugate transpose, the first component becomes the first row. So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait that's not right. Wait, wait, no: when you take the conjugate transpose, you first transpose the vector, then take the complex conjugate. Oh wait no, conjugate transpose is the transpose (rows and columns swapped) and each element is conjugated. So for a column vector [a; b], the conjugate transpose is [a* b*], where * is the conjugate.

So ψ is [3i; 4]. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4 (since it's real). So ψ† is [ -
