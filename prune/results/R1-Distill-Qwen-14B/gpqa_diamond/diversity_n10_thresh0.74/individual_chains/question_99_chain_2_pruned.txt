Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The given options are four different chemical structures, and I need to choose the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in carboxylic acids. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, which is typical of a carbonyl group. So, the compound likely has both a carboxylic acid group (since the broad peak could be from the -OH stretch) and a carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester or another carbonyl-containing functional group. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a carbonyl in their structure as well, right? So maybe the 1700 cm⁻¹ is from the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. That makes sense because the O-H in carboxylic acids usually shows a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which fits the 3000 cm⁻¹ mentioned here.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. They mention several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there are no double bonds or aromatic regions in the compound, which probably means it's a saturated structure. Also, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about what kind of splitting that might indicate.

In NMR, splitting arises from neighboring protons. Let's consider the possible structures. Each option is a variation of a substituted butanoic acid perhaps. Let me look at the options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure is something like CH2CH2 groups attached to the central carbons, then a CH2 connected to COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, the central carbons each have a CH2CH3 (ethyl) group and a CH2 group, ending with COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Here, the central carbons have methyl groups and a CH2 connected to COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the central carbons have an ethyl and a methyl group, leading to COOH.

Wait, but let me draw structures more clearly.

Maybe it's something like (CH2CH3) and (CH3) on adjacent carbons, or other substituents.

Wait, let me think about
