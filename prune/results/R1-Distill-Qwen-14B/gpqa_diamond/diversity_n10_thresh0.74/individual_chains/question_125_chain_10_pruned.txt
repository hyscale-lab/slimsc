Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is a system where the particle experiences the same potential in all directions, so each direction (x, y, z) contributes equally. 

Wait, right. The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, actually, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or is it (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers? Oh, right, because in 3D, the principal quantum number isn't exactly like in hydrogen. Instead, each direction contributes its own quantum number.

Wait, no, in 3D harmonic oscillator, it's often treated as a sum of three 1D oscillators. So the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. Each 1D energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is 0,1,2... So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, I think another approach is using the quantum numbers in terms of the radial part. Because sometimes, especially in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the principal quantum number n, which includes the radial and angular parts. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number n, where n = 2k + l, where l is the angular momentum quantum number (0,1,2,...), and k is a non-negative integer. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact way. Alternatively, it's often stated that the energy levels are equally spaced and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, let me think again. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer such that n = 2ν + l, where ν is a non-negative integer and l is the angular momentum quantum number (0,1,2,...). Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing this up with hydrogen-like orbitals. Maybe it's better to stick with the first approach.

In the 3D case, each energy level can be characterized by the principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each energy level E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω. Each n corresponds to a certain energy level.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, what does that mean? Let's think. The ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 (since n_x, n_y, n_z are all 0). The first excited state would be the next energy level, which is n=1. The second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3. Because ground is n=0 (no excitations), first excited
