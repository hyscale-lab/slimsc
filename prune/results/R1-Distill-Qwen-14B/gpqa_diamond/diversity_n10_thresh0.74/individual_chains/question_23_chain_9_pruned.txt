Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, especially if it's a Markovnikov addition. But wait, the compound here might be more complex.

The compound given is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-O- connected to a butenyl group that's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but it's 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let's break that down.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no, the butenyl group is four carbons. So position 3 is where the double bond starts. So the structure is CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no, the butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at position 3, meaning between C3 and C4. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, butenyl is four carbons, with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be: the first carbon is attached to the oxygen, the second is CH2, the third is CH2, and the fourth is CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me number it correctly.

But-3-en-1-yl: the first carbon (1) is connected to the oxygen. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C
