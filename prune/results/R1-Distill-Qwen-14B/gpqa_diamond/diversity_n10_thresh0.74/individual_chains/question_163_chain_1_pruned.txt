Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a volume and pH.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so I think when it reacts with an acid, it should form a salt and water. Since the acid is monobasic, like HCl or HNO3, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O.

First, let me write the reaction equation. Fe(OH)3 is a solid, right? So the reaction would be Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ → Fe³+ (aq) + 3H2O(l). Oh wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. Wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17, three OHs so 51, total 106.85 g/mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Hmm, approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:3 molar ratio, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So, to find the volume needed, I can use M = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranging, volume = moles / M.

Volume needed = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. Oh, wait, but wait. The reaction equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+. So that calculation is correct.

But wait, the
