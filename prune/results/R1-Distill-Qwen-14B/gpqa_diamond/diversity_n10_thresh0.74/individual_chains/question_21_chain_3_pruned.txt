Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. The two types mentioned are constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in geometric or optical isomerism.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structural isomers. Like how ketones and aldehydes can tautomerize into each other, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's about keto-enol tautomerism, which occurs in compounds with conjugated carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone, I think it's a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. But wait, benzoquinone is actually a diketone, right? So maybe it can have some tautomerism because of the conjugated carbonyl groups. Or does it not because it's a quinone structure?

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups in a cyclohexane ring. That's a lot of adjacent ketones. The keto-enol tautomerism usually requires conjugated carbonyl groups, so maybe this compound has that. But wait, tricarbonyl groups arranged symmetrically as 1,3,5 might not allow much tautomerism because of their positions. Or perhaps they can't easily lose a proton because the positions are too far apart or the structure is too rigid.

Wait, let me think. Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen between adjacent atoms, usually in conjugated systems. For example, in a diketone, you can have enol and keto forms. But in a trione, like cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the positions are every other carbon. So the carbonyls are at 1,3,5, which are alternated around the ring. So that might not allow for the same kind of conjugation needed for enol tautomerism. Because the positions are spaced out, it's not possible for the H to shift in the way needed. So maybe this compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is 1,4-diketone. So maybe it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Or wait, benzoquinone is more likely to have some resonance structures but maybe not tautomerism. Alternatively, wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't tautomerize because it's a fully conjugated system. Or perhaps it does, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. Tautomerism is more common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups or in conjugated systems that allow for the transfer of a hydrogen. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-dione can tautomer
