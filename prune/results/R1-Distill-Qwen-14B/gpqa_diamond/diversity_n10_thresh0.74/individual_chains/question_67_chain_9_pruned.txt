Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. Their angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The question is about the joint probability of measuring both electrons' orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So we're measuring each electron's L_z and seeing if both are -ħ.

Hmm. Wait, so each electron has a p orbital, which means their individual orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1. So l₁ and l₂ are both 1. The total angular momentum is given as l=2, and m is -1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the coupled angular momentum states work. I remember that when you have two particles, their angular momenta can combine in different ways. The total angular momentum quantum number l is the sum of the individual l's, but that's not always the case. Oh wait, when combining two angular momenta, the possible total l values range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Since both l1 and l2 are 1, the possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is one of these possibilities.

The state is specified by |l₁, l₂, l, m>, so that's l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. So the total m is -1. Now, the question is about measuring L₁z and L₂z for both electrons. Since each Lz is an operator, their eigenvalues are m multiplied by ħ. So for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or ħ because l=1 → m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the question asks for the probability that both L₁z and L₂z are measured as -ħ. So each would have m_i = -1. So what's the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 in the given state?

The state is |1,1,2,-
