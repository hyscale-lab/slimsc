Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by understanding what it's asking.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, wait, uniform in what sense? I think it's probably referring to a uniform density, meaning that the number of stars per unit volume is the same throughout space. Or maybe it's uniform on the celestial sphere, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So we're looking at the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), since plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like per unit plx). So, if I imagine a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? And how does that number depend on plx.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So it's the number density in the plx space.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think it must relate to the volume of space at a certain distance. Because for a given parallax (distance), the volume of space that corresponds to a small
