Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see. I'll start by looking at the given data: the IR and the 1H NMR spectra.

First, the IR. The strong absorption around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 probably indicates N-H stretches. Those are usually broad or strong. For amines or amides, the N-H stretch would be in that region. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a good indicator of a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone, but considering the formula, more likely an ester or amide.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH3 group attached to an OCH2, like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or an ethyl ether.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests maybe an NH group, but the integration is 2H. Wait, but if it's a singlet and broad, maybe it's an NH2 group. Or perhaps adjacent to something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but the shift is a bit upfield for an oxygenated CH2. Or maybe it's a methylene next to an oxygen, but the broadness is confusing me.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet often comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group where each CH2 is split by the neighboring group. So maybe this is part of an ester group, such as OCH2CH3, but wait, the ethyl group would be at lower ppm, like 1.2. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like in an ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift around 8.0 ppm could be due to electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, one at para position. For example, an amide group (which has a carbonyl) or an ester group.

Putting this together. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's think about the possible functional groups. The IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe an amide or an ester. The NMR has a triplet at 1.2, which is likely an ethyl group (CH2CH3), so maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is an amide, so the carbonyl would be in the IR. The ethoxy group would show up as a triplet. The amide N-H would be in the IR. The NMR would have the ethoxy as a triplet (CH2CH3), but wait in benzamide, the amide group is CONH2. Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. Benzamide's NH would be broad, but in the NMR, the singlet is at 4.0. Hmm, maybe not matching.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH-aryl. Ethoxy group is at para position. The formamide would have a NH, which would show a broad peak. The ethoxy would show triplet. The 1720 cm-1 in IR
