Okay, so I've got this question about a metric given in terms of ds², and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the metric is given as ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric since it's only in dx and dy. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface in 3D, right? Or is it maybe a 2D surface embedded in some space?

Wait, pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric is similar to hyperbolic space. But what's the area of a pseudosphere? I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area can be a bit tricky because it's unbounded in some ways.

Wait, the metric given here: let's see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which would make the metric blow up. So that suggests that the maximum x² + y² is less than 4. So the domain of x and y is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, which is the interior of a circle of radius 2. So the radius here is 2, matching the question's r=2.

Now, the area of a pseudosphere. Normally, a pseudosphere is a surface of revolution of a tractrix, and its
