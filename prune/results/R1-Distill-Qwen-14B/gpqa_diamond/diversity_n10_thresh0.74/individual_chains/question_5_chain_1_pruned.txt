Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. We need to find the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. So, for an operator P along a direction n, the eigenvalue equation is P|ψ⟩ = λ|ψ⟩, where λ is the eigenvalue, and |ψ⟩ is the eigenvector.

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the operator we're considering is the total angular momentum operator, or perhaps it's a spin component? Since it's a muon, which is a lepton, and I think it's spin-½, so the operator is the spin operator.

So the operator P here is probably the spin angular momentum operator in some direction. The components are given, so the total operator along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n lies in the x-z plane, which means the y-component of n is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But the eigenvector is for the operator P along n. So we'll need to construct the matrix for P in the direction of n, then find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down the given components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along n would be:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z (
