Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile treated with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me think. So, the first reaction starts with a ketone. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And it's reacting with NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon.

So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let me draw that. The molecule has a nitrile group (CN-) attached to a carbon that's also attached to two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group. So, the carbonyl group is being converted into an alcohol and a nitrile.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait! No, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's more about an addition. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, opening it up. But then, what happens next? Oh, right, in such reactions, the product is a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a carbonyl group reacts with CN- to form an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So, the formation of a cyanohydrin. To form a cyanohydrin, the ketone reacts with NaCN in a specific condition. But, wait, what conditions are needed for that? I think the reaction typically uses an acid catalyst. Oh, right, because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile. So, the acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- can attack, and then water does a backside attack to form the alcohol.

So, the first reaction probably uses H3O+ as the catalyst. So, reagent A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, let's check the A part. Option A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, what's NaHSO3? That's sodium bisulfite. Oh, right, bisulfite is used in certain addition reactions too. Like with aldehydes and ketones, it can form bisulfite adducts. But in the case of NaCN, probably it's not involved. More likely, the reaction is acid-catalyzed, so H3O+ is correct. So A is H3O+.

So, for the first part, the correct A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydro
