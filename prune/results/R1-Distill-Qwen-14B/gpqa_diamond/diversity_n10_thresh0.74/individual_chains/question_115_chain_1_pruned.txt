Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons' directions.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, their energy and momentum must be conserved. So I think I need to apply conservation of both energy and momentum here.

Wait, but the electron and positron are moving towards each other, right? So their velocities are in opposite directions. The electron is moving from left to right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left), and the positron is moving from right to left. So their initial momenta are opposite in direction.

I should probably consider them in a frame where they're moving along the x-axis. Let's think about the initial momenta and energies.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for both. For the electron, gamma_e = 4. For the positron, gamma_p = 2. Wait, but wait—wait a second. Electrons and positrons have the same mass, right? So their rest mass is the same, but their gamma factors are different.

The momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v. But in terms of units, maybe it's easier to think in terms of relativistic energy. The total energy of each would be gamma * m*c². But since c is the same for both, maybe I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity.

Wait, but the initial setup is that the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So the electron has momentum p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e in the positive x-direction, and the positron has momentum p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p in the negative x-direction.

Wait, no, wait: when the positron is moving from the right, it's moving towards the left, so its velocity is negative, so its momentum would be negative. So the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p, but since v_p is negative (
