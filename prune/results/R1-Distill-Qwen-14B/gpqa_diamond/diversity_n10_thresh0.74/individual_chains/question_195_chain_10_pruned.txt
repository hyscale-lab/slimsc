Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Hmm. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's bright) from our view.

The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period is 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the max period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation happen.

Wait, transit and occultation events imply that the planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbital periods are such that they can both pass in front and behind the star from our perspective. So I think this has to do with the orbital distances and the relative sizes.

I remember that for a transit to happen, the planet must pass in front of the star. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the star's center. If the impact parameter is zero, it's a central transit. But in this case, it's 0.2 times the star's radius.

So for the first planet, impact parameter b = 0.2 * R_star. The star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, but I don't know if that's important right now. Let's see.

The question is about the second planet. We need to find its maximum orbital period where both events happen. So what determines whether both events occur?

I think both events (transit and occultation) require that the planets are in the same orbital plane, which they are. So their orbits are aligned. So the question is more about their orbital distances and orbital periods.

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to the orbital radius? Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play here. So for a circular orbit, the period squared is proportional to the radius cubed, but scaled by the mass of the star.

But wait, both planets are orbiting the same star, so the star's mass is the same. So for each planet, (P^2) / (a^3) is a constant, because Kepler's law is (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G M), where M is the star's mass.

So the ratio of the periods would be (P2 / P1) = (a2/a1)^(3/2). Because P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1), I can find P2.

But wait, the problem isn't just about the periods. It's about the transits and occultations. So I think it's more about the orbital distances of the two planets. Because for the second planet to transit, it must be at a distance where the star's
