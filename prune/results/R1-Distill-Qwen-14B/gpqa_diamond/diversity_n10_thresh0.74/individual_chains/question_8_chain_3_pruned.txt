Okay, so I have this genetics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine concerning resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some knockout experiments and got some data on resistance levels. I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the results.

So the setup: they have three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made single knockouts (g1, g2, g3), and double knockouts (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given as percentages compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%.

The resistances are:
- g1: 75% (so 75% as resistant as wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% 
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, and the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of them is a TF.

The options are about which gene is the TF and the relationships between the genes (like epistasis, pleiotropy, redundancy).

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like, in a pathway, if gene A acts upstream of gene B, then the phenotype of a double knockout A and B would be the same as the knockout of A alone. Because if A is not working, B doesn't get activated anyway. So in that case, gene A is epistatic to gene B.

Wait, but in terms of disease resistance, lower resistance means more susceptibility. So let's think about what each mutant is showing.

Looking at the single knockouts:
g2 has 0% resistance, so that's the most severe. The double knockouts involving g2 are all 0% as well, like g1g2 and g2g3. But what about g1g3?

g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both g1 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single knockout (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). But wait, 10% is lower than both, so perhaps they contribute differently.

Hmm, and the question says that one is a TF upstream. Let's think about the TF. The TF would activate other genes. So if the TF is not working, those downstream genes won't be expressed either.

Wait, but the knockouts are of the TF. So if G2 is a TF, then knocking out G2 would prevent its target genes (like G1 or G3) from being expressed. So in that case, the knockout g2 would have lower resistance because those downstream genes aren't active.

Wait, but in the data, g2 is 0% resistance, which is the lowest. So maybe G2 is a TF that activates other genes involved in resistance. So without G2, those other genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

But let's look at the other mutants. g1 has 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, but not as much as knocking out G2. Similarly, G3 knockout is 50%, so less severe.

Now, if G2 is the TF, then the presence of G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and/or G3. So in a double mutant where G2 is already knocked out (like g2g1 or g2g3), the resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0%. Because without G2, the others aren't working. And indeed, in the data, g2g1 is 0% and g2g3 is 0%.

What about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either alone. Hmm, that's interesting. If the two genes are in parallel pathways, maybe each contributes some resistance. So when both are out, resistance drops further.

Now, the options. Let's look at each option.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but if G1 is the TF, then knocking out G1 would affect downstream genes. But in the data, g2 is the most severe, so maybe G2 is downstream? Not sure.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, but I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's about how the mutations affect the same pathway.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone.

Wait, looking at the data: single g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So g1 alone has higher resistance than g3. If they were redundant, maybe knocking both out would be worse than either. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% is worse than both singles). So that suggests redundancy.

If G2 is the TF, then in the double mutants involving G2, like g2g1, we see 0% resistance. G2's knockout would have already disabled the TF, so G1's function isn't expressed, hence similar to g2.

So if G2 is the TF, then in the double mutants g1g2 and g3g2, the resistance is same as g2 because the TF is already not working.

But what about the epistatic relationships? Epistasis is about the order in a pathway. So if gene A is upstream of gene B, then a double mutant of A and B would have the same phenotype as A alone.

In this case, if G2 is the TF, perhaps it's upstream of both G1 and G3. So knocking out G2 would disable both. But when you knock out G1, you might leave G2 and G3 functional. So in g1, G2 is still active, so perhaps G2 activates G3, which is why g1 has 75% resistance (maybe G3 contributes more to resistance than G1? Or maybe G1 isn't as crucial as G3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the single mutants, g2 is the most susceptible. So if G2 is the TF, then the other genes (G1 and G3) might be downstream of G2. So when G2 is knocked out, none of the downstream genes are expressed, leading to no resistance.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g3g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (worse than either single)

So for the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is much lower than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse. So each contributes something, so without both, the resistance is lower than each alone.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are part of the same pathway, but if they're redundant, their double knockout would have a worse phenotype than either single.

Wait, let's think about redundancy. If G1 and G3 are redundant, their functions can compensate for each other. So knocking out one (e.g., g1) would have a certain phenotype, but knocking out both (g1g3) would be worse. Which fits the data: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g1g3 is 10%. So both contribute to the resistance, and when neither is present, the resistance is much lower.

So if G2 is the TF, which activates G1 and G3, then in the double mutants g2g1 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2 because G2's knockout already disables the pathway. So the presence of G1 or G3 doesn't matter because their expression is downstream of G2.

In the double mutant g1g3, since both are downstream of G2, but their own functions contribute, their combined knockout would reduce resistance further. So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, maybe are redundant.

So looking back at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So knocking out both would be worse than either alone. That fits the
