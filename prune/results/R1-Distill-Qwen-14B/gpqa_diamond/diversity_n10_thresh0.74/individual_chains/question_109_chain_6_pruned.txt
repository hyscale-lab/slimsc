Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron I guess) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle is involved, and the problem gives a relation between the isospin T(NN), spin S(NN), and orbital angular momentum L(NN) as T = S + L + 1 mod 2. 

The final state of the NN system has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave isn't allowed, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Okay, let's break it down. The initial state is 1S0. So according to the term symbol notation given, (2S+1)L(J), where S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is total. So for 1S0, 2S+1 = 1 implies S=0. The L is S, which is 0, so the term is ^1S_0. Wait, no, wait: the term is (2S+1)L J, so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital 0, angular momentum 0.

Wait, but when they emit a particle X, the NN system transitions to a new state. The question provides options where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state after emission is something else.

The options are A to D, each showing 1S0 → something (like 7D1, etc.), and a particle (p, s, f, etc.) with a lowercase letter. Those letters denote the angular momentum state of X: p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.

So for each option, the final state (after emission) is a certain state, and the particle X has a certain l value.

The problem says to use conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Also, the Pauli condition gives T = S + L +1 mod 2 for the final NN state.

Given that the final T(NN) is 0, so T=0. Let's see what that implies for S and L.

So T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Set T=0: 0 = (S + L + 1) mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S and L must sum to an odd number. So they're of opposite parity.

Now, let's think about each option.

Each option has the initial state 1S0. The NN system emits a particle, so the process is 1S0 → (NN state) + X.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial is 1S0, then after emitting X, the NN system is in a different
