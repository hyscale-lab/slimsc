Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to the particle being in an excited state or something like that.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, mean decay distance. I think that relates to how far the particle travels before decaying. So the distance would depend on its lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like distance = velocity * lifetime.

But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for a resonance, Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units in GeV·s or something. I'll need to convert units properly.

So first, let's compute the lifetime τ. Then, find the velocity of the meson, and then multiply them to get the distance.

But wait, how to find the velocity? The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. Its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is higher than the mass, meaning it's moving relativistically.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, I can calculate γ as E / m. Wait, but I need to be careful with units. Let me think.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²) * c²? Hmm, maybe it's better to work in natural units where c=1. Then E = γ m, so γ = E/m. That should be easier.

So γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, but again, in natural units, c=1, so γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²). So solving for v:

gamma squared is 1/(1 - v²) → 1 - v² = 1/(gamma squared) → v² = 1 - (1/gamma²) → v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

So plugging in gamma = 6.6667, let's compute 1/gamma squared. 6.6667^2 is about 44.444, so 1/44.444 is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is about sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. Close to the speed of light.

Wait, for precise computation, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute gamma squared precisely. 8 / 1.2 is exactly 6.666666... So gamma squared is (6.666666...)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.444444...

So 1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately sqrt(0.9775) = let me compute that.

Well, 0.988 squared is 0.976144. Wait, 0.988^2 = (0.98 *10 + 0.008)^2? Wait, no, 0.988^2 is (0.98 + 0.008)^2 =
