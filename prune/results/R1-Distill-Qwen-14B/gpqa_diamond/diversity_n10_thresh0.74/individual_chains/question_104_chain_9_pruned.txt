Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, the question involves understanding how the RV method works and relating the measured shifts in spectral lines to the orbital periods of the planets.

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, there are two stars with the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detected planet 1 with a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet 2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.

Wait, RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to move. The shift in wavelength (the spectral line moving) depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The larger the shift, the higher the velocity, I think.

But how does that relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method can give the mass of the planet and the period. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something) Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version for when M_p is much smaller than M_star (which is the case here since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's). So, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p â‰ˆ M_star.

So, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something) Wait, no, I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ]^(something). Hmm, maybe I should think about the formula differently. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between K and P when M_p and M_star are the same for both planets.

Wait,
