Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state. The state vector is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}). Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N ensures the state is normalized.

Wait, the question is asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

I remember that Gaussian states are states whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. Examples include coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. Non-Gaussian states, like Schrödinger cat states, are superpositions of Gaussian states and thus have non-Gaussian Wigner functions, which are important for quantum computing applications because they can't be efficiently simulated by classical computers.

Relative entropy, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence, measures how different one probability distribution is from another. In quantum information, it's used to quantify the distinguishability between two quantum states. For non-Gaussianity, the idea is that the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state gives a measure of how non-Gaussian it is.

But wait, how do I compute this for the given state? Let me think.

First, I need to construct the density matrix rho for the state |psi>. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Since it's a pure state, rho is a projector. But maybe it's easier to compute in terms of the basis states.

The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So the density matrix would be:

rho = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>][cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha|] / N^2.

Expanding that, rho becomes [cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / N^2.

Hmm, but what is the reference Gaussian state tau? Oh wait, in the context of non-Gaussianity measures, the reference Gaussian state is usually the one that is closest in some sense to the non-Gaussian state. But in the case of a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the most natural Gaussian reference might be the completely mixed state, or perhaps the state that's the statistical mixture of the two coherent states in the superposition.

Wait, another thought—could the reference Gaussian state be the state obtained by taking the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and considering it as a Gaussian state? Because for the cat state, if you ignore the quantum interference terms, you might get a Gaussian state. Let me think: the density matrix of the coherent state |alpha> is Gaussian. But when you have a superposition like |psi>, the density matrix includes cross terms like |alpha><-alpha|, which are non-Gaussian. So the reference Gaussian state tau would be the state obtained by removing these cross terms, or perhaps taking the diagonal terms only.

Alternatively, the reference Gaussian state is the one that is closest to rho in some sense, perhaps the one with the same first moments and covariance matrix as rho. But I'm not sure about the exact approach here.

Wait, another approach: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state. So del_b = S(rho || tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. But calculating the closest Gaussian state is non-trivial. Oh wait, but in this problem, the relative entropy is given by the formula provided, which is S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von
