Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that it's related to quantum mechanics, right? The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron when we know the uncertainty in its position (Δx). 

Wait, the problem states the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position is Δx = 0.1 nm. Oh wait, no, wait, the speed might not be directly needed here. Because I think the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum, not directly speed. Or wait, maybe I can relate velocity to momentum.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, which is mass times uncertainty in velocity, but maybe I can just use Δp ≈ h/(4π Δx) for the minimum uncertainty.

Oh wait, but the question is about energy uncertainty. Hmm. How to connect that. Hmm, because if I have the uncertainty in momentum, I can relate that to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), right? So if I know Δp, maybe I can find ΔE.

But wait, the problem is about the uncertainty in energy. Hmm, so perhaps the minimum uncertainty in energy would be based on the uncertainty in momentum. Because the kinetic energy is related to momentum. So maybe I should calculate the uncertainty in momentum first, then find the corresponding energy.

Alright, let's start step by step.

First, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes people use h-bar, which is h divided by 2π. Oh right, because the uncertainty principle can be written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, sometimes I see it as ħ/2 or ħ/(2π), maybe. Wait, no, the standard form is Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π). Let me check: h/(4π) = (h/(2π))/2 = ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

So, Δp ≥ h/(4π Δx) → but I think a better approach is to calculate Δp as h/(4π Δx), because that gives the minimum uncertainty.

Wait, but sometimes people use the approximation where Δp is approximately equal to h/(2π Δx) because when they take the uncertainty in momentum as the momentum associated with the uncertainty in position. But I'm a bit confused here. Oh, because the actual uncertainty could be larger, but the minimum would be when it's exactly h/(4π), so Δp = h/(4π Δx) for the minimum case.

So let's compute Δp first.

Δx is given as 0.1 nm. Wait, that's 0.1e-9 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

So Δp = h/(4π Δx) = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (4 * π * 1e-10 m)

Let me compute that denominator first. 4 * π is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 1e-10 m = 1.2566e-9 m
