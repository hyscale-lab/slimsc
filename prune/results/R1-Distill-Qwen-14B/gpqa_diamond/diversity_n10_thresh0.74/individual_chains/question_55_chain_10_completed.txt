Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. So, the possible structures must involve an acetate group (so an ester, right?) attached to either a propenyl or butenyl group, and whether those substituents are cis or trans.

Looking at the NMR data provided:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets?
Wait, no, the notation is "dq". I think that stands for doublet of quadruplets or doublet of something else. Oh wait, in NMR splitting terms, 'd' is doublet, 't' triplet, 'q' quartet, 'm' multiplet, etc. So 'dq' would be a doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet with a quartet as the splitting? Hmm, not entirely sure. I think it's a doublet of something else, perhaps a triplet? Or maybe it's a doublet and another split. I'll have to come back to that.

The other signals:
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's probably the acetate's methyl group (OAc group), which is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because the three equivalent protons don't split each other.
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to something that splits it into a doublet. Wait, but in this case, 3H as a doublet. Oh, wait, maybe it's a CH2 group where one of the protons is split into a doublet? Or perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the structures of these compounds. Let's break down the options.

First, the general structure of an acetate ester is R-O-CO-O-R', wait no, wait. No, the ester group is O-CO-O, but actually, the structure is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but with a double bond. Maybe better to draw it mentally.

Wait, let's take each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. The propenyl group is CH2=C-CH2-OAc? Wait, no, wait: the structure of propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have the structure wrong. Let me think: the acetate ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So, for propenyl acetate, the propenyl group is OCH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So, propenyl can be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's trans. Or wait, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E) or (Z) isomer. Let's imagine the propenyl group is CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, let's think differently. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-Me (since the acetate is CH3COO-). But wait, the propenyl group can also be in the cis or trans configuration, but wait, propenyl has a double bond so it's about substituents on either end. Wait, but propenyl itself is a substituent—so if the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the double bond is between the first and second carbons. Now, in that case, the substituents on either side are CH2OAc and CH3.

Wait, but the question is about the configuration of the substituents on the double bond. So, for propenyl, the substituents on the double bond would be CH2OAc and CH2CH3 (if it's propenyl), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the actual structure. Let me think about the possible structures.

Let me take Cis-propenyl acetate. The structure would be where the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. So, for propenyl, the substituents are the OAc group and the CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be:

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but the OAc is on the CH2. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the groups attached to C1 are a CH3 (from the ester) and a CH2OAc. Hmm, not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are the methyl group from the acetate and the other substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the NMR signals.

The first signal is at 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a relatively downfield shift, so probably a proton adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an aromatic ring? But wait, acetate is an ester, but propenyl and butenyl groups don't have aromatic rings. Hmm, unless there's conjugation. Wait, maybe the doublet is from a vinyl proton, like in an ester with a double bond.

Wait, in an ester with a double bond adjacent to the oxygen, the protons on the double bond can show coupling, and their shifts depend on the substituents.

So, for example, in an allyl ester, the protons on the double bond can be split by adjacent protons.

So, let's think about each option. Let's take each possible structure and see what the NMR would look like.

First, let's imagine the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that would be propenyl acetate. The double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

Wait, but the propenyl group could have the OAc on either end. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-OAc, but that's not correct. Alternatively, it's CH2=CH-O-Ac attached to CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the substituents on the double bond. The doublet around 7 ppm suggests a proton that is coupled to another proton, and the coupling constant J=16 Hz is quite large, typical for a trans coupling in a double bond.

Wait, in a trans double bond, the coupling between the two protons is larger because they are on opposite sides. So, for a trans double bond, the coupling (J) is higher, around 16 Hz, whereas cis would have a lower J, maybe 10 Hz or less. So, if the 7 ppm proton is a doublet with J=16 Hz, that suggests that it's coupled to another proton across a double bond. So, that would indicate a trans configuration.

Wait, but how does that fit into the structure? Let me think about the coupling.

In an ester like propenyl acetate, the structure might be CH2=CH-O-Ac-CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me get this right.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows two sets of signals for the double bond protons. Let's say the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the protons on the double bond are at CH2 and CH. Wait, but actually, the CH2 is on one side and the CH-OAc is on the other.

Wait, perhaps the ester is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not a propenyl. Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2? No, that's not right either.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the butenyl acetates. Let's imagine butenyl acetate. The butenyl group is CH2CHCHCH2, but with a double bond. So, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's 1-pentenyl acetate. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. No, that's propenyl.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the possible structures of the options.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. So, the butenyl group is in cis configuration. So, the substituents on either side of the double bond are cis.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl group with trans configuration.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Propenyl with cis configuration.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Butenyl with trans configuration.

Wait, no. Wait, propenyl has a double bond, so the configuration refers to the substituents on either side. Similarly for butenyl.

But wait, propenyl is -CH2-CH2-CH2- with the double bond between the first and second carbons, right? So, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-.

But if it's a propenyl group, the structure of the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Now, the substituents on the double bond are CH3 (from the OAc) and CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me think again. The structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's butyl, not propenyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the actual structures. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals again.

So, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz). That suggests a proton coupled to another with a large coupling, likely in a trans configuration across a double bond.

Another peak at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). So, two sets of couplings, perhaps. Like a doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe a doublet of doublets? The 'dq' notation is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a doublet that's further split into a quadruplet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets?

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the splitting patterns. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet, so it's split by one neighbor. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which suggests that this proton is coupled to two sets of protons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of doublets, each coupling to two different protons. Or perhaps a triplet of doublets?

Alternatively, maybe the protons on the double bond are each coupled to two others. For example, in a structure where a proton is adjacent to another double bond, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures again. Let's imagine the compound is propenyl acetate. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Looking at the structure, we have a double bond between C1 and C2. The groups attached are CH3 (from OAc) on C2 and CH2CH3 on C1? Wait, no, OAc is on C3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, the OAc is O-CO-CH3. So, the ester group is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is the ester: the R group is the propenyl, so OAc-O-R, where R is propenyl. So, R is CH2=CHCH2-.

So, the entire structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, the ester is formed from the alcohol, so it's R-O-CO-R', where R is the propenyl and R' is the acetyl (from acetic acid). So, the structure is (CH2=CHCH2-O) connected to (CO-OCH3). Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl group. So, in propenyl acetate, R is CH2=CHCH2-, and R' is CH3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it forms an ester, it's R-O-CO-R'. So, if R is propenyl, then propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because the O is between the CH2 and CO. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, but the oxygen is part of the ester group.

Now, in that structure, the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. The substituents on the double bond are CH2OAc (CH2 connected to O-CO-CH3) and CH3 (from the double bond being CH2-CH2-OAc). Wait, no, the substituents are CH2-O-CO-CH3 (on one side) and CH3 (on the other? No, that can't be right. Maybe the substituents are H and CH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the structure: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The substituents on the double bond are H and CH2-O-CO-CH3 on one side, and CH2- on the other? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are CH2-O-CO-CH3 and CH2CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

But let's think about the NMR. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling. So, perhaps it's a trans double bond.

In the structure, the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides. So, each proton is coupled to the other, leading to a doublet for each. So, each would be a doublet.

Wait, but in this case, the NMR shows two signals: one at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) and another at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). So, that suggests that perhaps only one of the double bond protons is showing up as a doublet, and the other is a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, maybe one of the double bond protons has more coupling partners. Let me try to imagine.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the two protons on the double bond are on adjacent carbons: one is CH2 (so two H) and the other is CH (one H). Wait, but that can't be. No, wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2: C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-Me. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-O-CO-Me. So, the protons on C1 would be two H, and on C2, one H.

Wait, so the protons on C1 would be split by the proton on C2. Since there's a double bond, the coupling between the protons on C1 and C2 would be through the double bond, which is a trans configuration. So, each proton on C1 would couple with the proton on C2.

Wait, but in that case, the protons on C1 would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps. Because each H on C1 is coupled to the single H on C2.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C2 is coupled to both Hs on C1 and maybe other protons elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR shows two distinct signals for the double bond protons. One is at 7.0 (d, J=16) and another at 5.5 (dq). So, perhaps the H at 7.0 is the one on C2, which is coupled to the two Hs on C1 (but that would be a triplet, not a doublet). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, for butenyl, perhaps.

Wait, let's think about butenyl. The structure could be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. But butenyl ester would be longer.

Wait, but the NMR data also has a 1.6 ppm peak, which is a doublet (3H). That suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. Because the splitting is a doublet, the methyl is next to a CH2, which has two protons. So, perhaps the structure has a CH(CH3) group, but no, the 1.6 ppm is for 3H as a doublet. So, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3), but that's speculative.

Wait, another approach: The 2.1 ppm peak is a singlet for 3H, which is the methyl from the acetate. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet for 3H. So, perhaps that's a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Like a CH2 group attached to the methyl. So, a structure like CH2-CH(CH3), but not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z)- or (E)-CH2=CH-O-Ac. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

But I'm not making progress. Let's think about the splitting patterns again.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (so J=16 Hz), which suggests it's coupled to one other proton. The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm peak is the proton on the double bond that's coupling with a proton across the double bond, and another proton elsewhere, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a butenyl group, which has a longer chain. Let's imagine the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, for butenyl acetate, the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, but no, wait, butenyl is four carbons, so perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Wait, but that's pentenyl. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of protons in each signal. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, the 5.5 is 1H, the 2.1 is 3H, and the 1.6 is 3H. So, in total, 1+1+3+3=8 H. But wait, the molecule should have more H, but perhaps the other H are in a multiplet or integrated as part of the signals.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two double bond Hs are split into two different signals. For example, in a trans configuration, each H would be a doublet, but due to other couplings, their shifts would be different.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm H is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a large coupling. So, perhaps this is the H on a trans double bond coupled to the other H on the same double bond. So, each H on the double bond is a doublet, but in the NMR, perhaps only two Hs are observed as two separate signals.

But wait, the doublet at 7.0 ppm is 1H, and the 5.5 is another 1H. So, perhaps the two Hs on the double bond are in different environments, which would cause their shifts to be different.

In a trans configuration, the two Hs on the double bond are on opposite sides, so their chemical shifts could be different. For example, if one is more deshielded than the other, it would appear at a higher ppm.

So, in the trans-propenyl acetate, the two Hs on the double bond would be trans, and each would couple with the other, giving each a doublet. But why would one be at 7.0 and the other at 5.5?

Wait, perhaps one of them is also coupled to another proton elsewhere, leading to a more complex splitting. The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has another double bond or another set of coupling partners. For instance, if the structure is such that the H at 5.5 ppm is also adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to more splitting.

Another thought: The 1.6 ppm signal is a doublet of 3H. That suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. So, perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH2CH3) connected to something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a branching point. For example, a structure where a CH2 group is attached to a CH(CH3), leading to the CH3 being a doublet.

Wait, so putting it all together: the 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl. The 1.6 ppm is a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but 3H as a doublet would be a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-3-pentenyl acetate or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of each option and their corresponding NMR.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the same side of the double bond.

In this case, the two protons on the double bond are cis, so their chemical shifts would be similar. But if one is more deshielded, it might appear at a higher ppm.

In the NMR, the two double bond protons would each couple with each other, but if they're cis, the coupling (J) would be lower, perhaps around 10-12 Hz. But in the given data, J is 16 Hz, which is higher, suggesting trans coupling.

So, if the data shows a J of 16, it's more likely a trans configuration.

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16, which would fit a trans coupling. So, the structure is likely trans.

So, among the options, options B and D have trans configurations.

Option B is Trans-propenyl acetate, and option D is Trans-butenyl acetate.

So, whether it's propenyl or butenyl, we need to determine which fits.

Wait, let's think about the other signals.

We have a 5.5 ppm peak (1H, dq). And a 1.6 ppm (3H, d). So, perhaps the structure is longer, like butenyl.

Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. But wait, that's butenyl, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

In that case, the double bond would have two Hs: at C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). Wait, but in this structure, the double bond is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the Hs on C1 would be two Hs, and on C2, one H.

Wait, but the NMR for the double bond would show two Hs as a triplet and one H as a doublet? Or perhaps each H is split by the other.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the number of signals.

In the NMR, the double bond protons are split into two signals: 7.0 and 5.5. So, perhaps the two Hs on the double bond are in different environments, which would happen if the substituents on either side of the double bond are different.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the substituents on the double bond are OAc and CH2CH3. So, each H would be in a different environment, leading to different chemical shifts.

So, one H would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (like 7.0), and the other at a lower ppm (5.5).

So, in that case, each H would be a doublet (coupled to each other), but perhaps the one at 7.0 is coupled to another proton elsewhere, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. So, perhaps the H at 5.5 is coupled to not only the H on the double bond but also to another set of protons, like a CH2 group.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH2-OAc group. So, perhaps the H at 5.5 is the CH2 H, which is coupled to the H on the double bond and perhaps to another CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm H is the H on the CH2 next to the double bond, which is coupled to the H on the double bond and to the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-OAc. But that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc with the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the H on C2 would be CH2, and the H on C3 would be CH2-OAc.

Wait, but then the 5.5 ppm H could be the H on C3, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (J=16 Hz) → likely a trans coupling on a double bond.
- The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of something, possibly coupled to another group.
- The 2.1 ppm is the OAc methyl → singlet.
- The 1.6 ppm is a CH3 group attached to a CH2 → doublet.

So, considering the trans configuration and the presence of a CH3 group attached to a CH2, perhaps the structure is trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but then what about the 5.5 ppm H? Let's imagine the structure is CH2=CH-O-Ac-CH2CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So, the two Hs on the double bond (CH2 and CH) would each be coupled to each other.

Wait, but the CH2 would have two Hs, which would split into a triplet if coupled to the CH. But the NMR shows only one H for each doublet. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the two Hs on the CH2 are split into a triplet, but perhaps one is more downfield.

Wait, but the NMR data only shows two Hs as singlets. Or perhaps they are integrating only for specific protons.

Wait, maybe I should stop trying to imagine the structure and instead look for the number of signals. The NMR data has four signals: 7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), 2.1 (3H), and 1.6 (3H). So, it's a total of 8 H. But acetate esters tend to have more H, but perhaps some are in a multiplet that isn't detailed here.

Hmm.

Another approach: looking for the number of signals. For propenyl acetate, the possible structures would have a double bond with two Hs. If the substituents are trans, each H would be a doublet.

In the given data, there are two Hs as doublets, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=C(CH2CH2OAc)CH3.

No, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-3-pentenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the J value.

The J=16 Hz suggests a trans double bond. So, the options are either B (Trans-propenyl) or D (Trans-butenyl).

Now, considering the other signals, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2.

In propenyl acetate (options B and C), the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the CH2-OAc is at the end. So, the CH2 would have two Hs, each coupled to the H on the double bond.

But in that structure, the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond, so their Hs would be a triplet perhaps.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a methyl, not a CH2. So, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is butenyl. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2CH2-OAc is after that. In this structure, the CH2 after the double bond (C3 and C4) would have Hs that are split into a triplet or something else.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Cis-propenyl acetate, but the J=16 suggests trans.

Wait, another thought: The 5.5 ppm (dq) could be a doublet of quartets, perhaps from coupling with two adjacent CH2 groups. But I'm not certain.

I think I've exhausted my approaches. Based on the J=16 Hz, it's likely a trans configuration. So between options B and D.

Now, the presence of the 1.6 ppm doublet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2, which would be more likely in a longer chain like butenyl. So, perhaps the correct answer is D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cis-propenyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in the trans configuration, the two Hs on the double bond would have different chemical shifts, which is what the data shows (7.0 and 5.5). So, that fits a trans double bond.

In propenyl, the substituents are OAc and CH2CH3. So, the Hs on the double bond would be on opposite sides. The H closer to the OAc would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm (7.0), and the H closer to CH2CH3 would be less deshielded, at 5.5.

So, the 7.0 ppm is the H closer to the OAc, and the 5.5 is the H closer to CH2CH3.

In that case, the structure would be trans-propenyl acetate, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B was Trans-propenyl acetate. So, then the correct answer would be B.

But wait, what about the 1.6 ppm signal? It's a doublet for 3H. That suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, which is butenyl, so option D. But then the J would be 16.

Hmm. I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the number of Hs on the double bond.

In propenyl, the double bond has two Hs on one CH2 and one H on the other CH. But butenyl would have a different arrangement.

Wait, but the data shows two separate 1H signals for the double bond, which would require each H to be in a different environment. So, perhaps a longer chain is more likely.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is D) Trans-butenyl acetate, which would have a longer chain and account for the 1.6 ppm CH3.

But I'm not entirely sure. At this point, I think the best option is to go with the trans configuration indicated by the J=16, which points to either B or D.

But considering the other signals, perhaps it's propenyl.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to make a decision.

The J=16 Hz suggests trans. So, between options B (Trans-propenyl) and D (Trans-butenyl). Now, looking at the number of Hs in the NMR, the 1.6 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH2, which would be more likely in a butenyl group.

So, the structure is likely Trans-butenyl acetate, option D.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, with varying configurations (cis or trans). The key is to analyze the NMR data and match it to the most likely structure.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**  
   - A doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) suggests a trans configuration across a double bond.  
   - This proton is likely on one side of the double bond, coupled to the proton on the opposite side.

2. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**  
   - A doublet of quadruplets indicates that this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons.  
   - This proton is likely on the double bond and influenced by additional splitting due to nearby groups.

3. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**  
   - A singlet for 3H corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester (OAc).

4. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**  
   - A doublet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A (Cis-butenyl acetate):**  
  In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) across the double bond would be smaller (typically <10 Hz). The observed J = 16 Hz strongly suggests a trans configuration, making this option unlikely.

- **Option B (Trans-propenyl acetate):**  
  The trans configuration aligns with the large J = 16 Hz. The structure of trans-propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc) would have two protons on the double bond, each in a different chemical environment due to the substituents (OAc and CH3). The 7.0 ppm peak corresponds to the proton closer to the OAc group (more deshielded), and the 5.5 ppm peak corresponds to the proton closer to CH3. However, the 1.6 ppm signal (3H, d) is not easily explained by this structure, as it lacks a CH3 group attached to a CH2.

- **Option C (Cis-propenyl acetate):**  
  Similar to Option A, the cis configuration would result in a smaller J value (<10 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16 Hz. This option is unlikely.

- **Option D (Trans-butenyl acetate):**  
  The trans configuration matches the large J = 16 Hz. The structure of trans-butenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc) includes a longer chain, which can account for the 1.6 ppm signal (3H, d). This signal likely corresponds to the CH3 group at the end of the chain, attached to a CH2 group. The 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm peaks can be attributed to the protons on the double bond, with the 7.0 ppm peak being the more deshielded proton closer to the OAc group.

### Conclusion:
The large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) and the presence of the 1.6 ppm signal (3H, d) strongly support the trans configuration. Among the options, **Trans-butenyl acetate** (Option D) best fits the NMR data.
