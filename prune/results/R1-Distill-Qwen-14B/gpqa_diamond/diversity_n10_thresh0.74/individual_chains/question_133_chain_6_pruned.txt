Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are provided: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

Wait, first, I should probably find out how many moles of each of these compounds are present in the solution. Moles are calculated by mass divided by molecular weight. So for KH2PO4, that's 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007347 moles. Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 1.00 g divided by 177.99 g/mol. Let me do that: 1 / 177.99 is about 0.005605 moles.

So, now I have the moles of each. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. These are both related to the phosphate ion, but in different forms. I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, they can form a buffer solution. So, in this case, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 might be acting as a buffer.

But wait, what's the actual species present here? Let me think. KH2PO4 dissociates in water into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- or accept a proton to become H3PO4. Similarly, Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions.

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- ions. But under normal circumstances, especially in aqueous solution, PO4^3- is not very stable and tends to pick up protons. So, the concentration of PO4^3- might be really low here. Wait, but the question is asking about orthophosphate, PO4^3-, but given the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, I think that the orthophosphate might be formed via the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the phosphate equilibria. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+
