Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question says that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each is about half the integral. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling between them. So why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So same molecular weight, but two separate peaks. So what would cause that?

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, the MS would have a different mass for the precursor. But the question says both have same mass. So probably not this.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same physical properties except for chiral properties. In NMR, they would show the same chemical shifts because the environments are identical except for the configuration. Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would still show each peak as a single peak. Wait, no, wait. Enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra because the environments of the protons are the same. So if you have a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks, because in the NMR, the two enantiomers would be indistinguishable. So perhaps option B isn't the right answer. Because the NMR would not show two peaks for the same proton.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not sure what that exactly means. Maybe during the reaction, the amide bond forms in such a way that two different coupling partners are formed. Or perhaps an issue with the coupling reaction, like some side reaction creating different diastereomers? Or maybe it's about the peptide bonds having different conformations?

Wait, the question said that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. The integrals are equal, so each is 0.5H. But the same chemical shift but two peaks. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, maybe it's not about coupling but about something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound has some kind of dynamic process. But the chemical shifts are similar, but not identical. So maybe if the molecule is interconverting between two forms that are in fast exchange, but that might cause a single peak or perhaps a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereomer, which would cause different coupling but same shift? Or different shifts?

Wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts. So if the diastereomers are present, maybe the alpha protons are in similar environments?

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are due to different diastereotopic protons. Wait, diastereotopic protons are in different environments but maybe in this case, the molecule has some symmetry, making two protons that are equivalent in the structure but not in the NMR. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has an internal plane of symmetry, so the two alpha protons are equivalent in the structure but not in the environment when the molecule is in a certain conformation. But I'm not sure. Or perhaps the molecule is undergoing some kind of ring flip that causes the protons to be in different environments quickly, but then in the NMR, they would average, causing a single peak.
