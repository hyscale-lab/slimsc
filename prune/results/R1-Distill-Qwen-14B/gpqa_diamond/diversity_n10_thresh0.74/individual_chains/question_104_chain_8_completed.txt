Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step.

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detects these planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the RV method detects the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula involved is probably the Doppler formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relations.

The RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) to the mass of the planet and other factors. The formula I recall is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (2π * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * something... Wait, maybe I should think about the simpler version.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But e is zero here because the orbits are circular, so that factor goes away. Also, M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune vs Sun-like star), so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So, simplifying, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Since both stars have the same mass (like Sun), and the planets are similar in mass (Neptune), M_planet is the same for both. So, let's denote M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

Thus, the formula for K becomes:

K ∝ ( (1/T) )^(1/3) )

Because all the other terms are the same for both planets.

So, K is inversely proportional to T^(1/3). Wait, because as T increases, K decreases. So if planet 2 has a larger K (7 vs 5 milliangstroms), but wait no, wait. Wait, wait, in the question, planet 1 has a shift of 5, and planet 2 has a shift of 7. So which one has a larger K?

Wait, K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity, which is measured via the Doppler shift. So a larger K would mean a larger velocity, which would produce a larger shift in the spectral lines. So Planet #2's star has a larger shift (7) than Planet #1 (5), meaning K2 > K1.

But from our earlier proportionality, K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/T)^(1/3). Since M_p and M_star are same for both, K is inversely proportional to T^(1/3).

So K ∝ T^(-1/3)

So if K2 > K1 → T2 < T1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So T2 / T1 = ?

Let me set up the proportion.

K1 / K2 = (T2 / T1)^(1/3)

Because K ∝ T^(-1/3), so K1 = (T2 / T1)^(1/3) * K2.

Wait, rearrange:

K1 = K2 * (T2 / T1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, let me think again.

If K ∝ T^(-1/3), then K1 = K2 * (T2 / T1)^(−1/3 )

Wait, perhaps I should write K1 = ( (T2 / T1) )^(−1/3 ) * K2.

Wait, let me think in terms of the proportionality.

K1 = ( constant ) * T1^(-1/3)

K2 = ( same constant ) * T2^(-1/3)

Dividing K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = (T2 / T1)^(1/3 )

So,

(K1 / K2) = (T2 / T1)^(1/3 )

We can solve for T2 / T1.

Rearranging:

(T2 / T1) = (K1 / K2 )³

So,

T2 / T1 = (5/7 )^3

Because K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So 5/7 is K1/K2.

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So T2 is approximately 0.364 times T1. So T2 is shorter than T1.

Wait, but the question is asking for how many times longer is T2 than T1. So T2 longer than T1? Wait no, because in our result, T2 is shorter than T1. So the ratio T2/T1 is 0.364, which is less than 1. So T2 is about 0.36 times T1, meaning it's shorter.

But the question is phrased as: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So they're asking T2 / T1. If T2 is shorter, T2 / T1 is less than 1, so the answer would be ~0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the logic.

Because if K is larger, the star's velocity is higher, which indicates a more massive planet or a closer orbit (since closer planets cause the star to move more). But in this case, the planets have similar masses, so a larger K would imply a shorter orbital period (since higher velocity, smaller orbit, shorter period). So if K2 is larger than K1, T2 is smaller than T1, so T2/T1 is less than 1.

So the ratio is (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that's the answer.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( T \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( T^{1/3} \), i.e., 

\[
K \propto T^{-1/3}.
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Rearranging for \( T_2 / T_1 \), we get:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. However, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( T_2 / T_1 < 1 \), planet #2's orbital period is not longer but shorter, and the ratio is approximately 0.36.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**
