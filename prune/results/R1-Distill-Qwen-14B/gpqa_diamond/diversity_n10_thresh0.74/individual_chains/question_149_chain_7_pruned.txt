Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a peptidic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on here. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand.

The scenario is that a small peptide has been synthesized, and they're looking at its 1H NMR and LC-MS. The NMR shows the expected peaks except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. So each is about half. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling because if that were the case, the peaks would split into a multiplet, not be two separate singlets or something. So it's not that.

Then the LC-MS. They ran it at elevated temperature, which I think is important. Two peaks with equal intensity, same mass. So the mass is the same as expected, but there's two. So what could cause two peaks with same mass but different in some other way?

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material, maybe not fully reacted. So if the crude sample had some unreacted starting material, the MS would show its mass. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected, so A is probably not it.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, and in NMR, if the sample isn't chiral (like in a racemic mixture), the protons' environments are the same, so you wouldn't see separate peaks. Wait, but wait, in the NMR, the two peaks from the same alpha proton. If it's a racemic mix, the NMR would be a singlet because the environments are identical to the other enantiomer. Unless there's something else. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Or maybe the splitting isn't due to coupling but something else. So B is possible?

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that is. Maybe during the amide formation, like in an SN2 reaction, there's some coupling? Or perhaps it's a scenario where the reaction didn't go to completion, but I'm not sure. How would that cause two peaks?

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, in the NMR, the two peaks for the same proton are similar. If they're diastereomers, maybe the shifts are close enough to be confused as two separate signals? But the total integral is 1H. So each diastereomer has the same number of protons, but perhaps in slightly different environments. So maybe that's possible.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule has diastereomers, the alpha proton would be split into two because each isomer has a different environment. But wait, in a mixture, each diastereomer would contribute their own sets of peaks. But if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the peaks would average, but here it's two peaks of same shift (similar) and same integral, adding up to 1H.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has some form of dynamic exchange. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks, so perhaps the exchange is slow on the NMR timescale, leading to two separate signals. But then, what's causing the diastereomerism?

Wait, another angle. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, so the molecular formula is same. In MS, same mass would mean same molecular weight, so same compound. Wait, but how can two peaks have same mass? They must be the same molecule, but separated for some reason. Or perhaps, it's a peak due to something else.

Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks from the same alpha proton. So each peak is 0.5H? Or each is 1H, but together they make 1H. No, wait, the integral together is 1H. So each is 0.5H. That doesn't make sense because protons are quantized. Oh wait, perhaps the two peaks are each 0.5H, but that would imply each is a doublet or something? But the question says each has similar shifts and approximately equal integrals, summing to 1H. So each is about 0.5H.

Wait, but protons are whole numbers. So maybe they're each 0.5H? How is that possible. Oh, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the integral of each is about the same, but together they sum to 1H. So each is about 0.5H. But that seems impossible for a proton NMR. Hmm, maybe the integral is each about 0.5, so together 1. Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from diastereotopic protons which are not equivalent. But diastereotopic protons are in a different environment, so they would have different chemical shifts. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts.

Wait, the question says the two peaks both correspond to the same alpha-proton. Wait, same alpha-proton? So the same proton in the same environment? That can't be possible because each proton can only resonate once. Unless it's a diastereomer situation where the same proton has two different environments.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the molecule is in a dynamic process, like a conformational change that is slow on the NMR timescale. So the same proton exists in two different environments, giving two peaks. But then, why would the LC-MS show two peaks? That doesn't make sense because the molecule would still be the same.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So they are isomers. Either enantiomers or diastereomers.

In the NMR, if it's a racemic mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would not split
