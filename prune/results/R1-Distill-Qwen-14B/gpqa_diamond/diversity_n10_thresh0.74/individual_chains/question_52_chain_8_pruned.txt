Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the question is about how the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. The spots themselves are cooler, I guess, since they appear darker. So the total emitted flux would change because a part of the surface is cooler.

Now, the specific part we're looking at is the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2. In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor. The ratio N1/N2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy difference.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has
