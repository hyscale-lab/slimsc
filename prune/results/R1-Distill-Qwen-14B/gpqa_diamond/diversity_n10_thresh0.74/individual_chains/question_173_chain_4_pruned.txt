Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. But wait, how do I apply that here?

The problem states that an electron is traveling with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are all on the order of 10^-something Joules, so I'll probably have to calculate something with Planck's constant.

Alright, so I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, we'll take the equality: Δx * Δp = ħ/2. So I can find Δp from that.

First, let me write down the values. Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. Got it.

So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me calculate that.

Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) 

Wait, 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10. So 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is 5.27e-25 J·s/m, because 1e-34 / 2e-10 is (1/2) * 1e-24, which is 5e-25? Let me double-check the calculation:

1.0545718e-34 / (2e-10) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-34/1e-10 = 0.5272859e-24, which is 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, how does this relate to the uncertainty in energy? Because energy is related to momentum. Since the electron is moving at a high speed, we might not need to consider relativistic effects, but wait, v is
