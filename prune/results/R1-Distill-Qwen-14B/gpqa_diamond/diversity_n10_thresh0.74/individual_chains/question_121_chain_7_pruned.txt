Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, the question is about the reaction of a cyclic epoxide with an organocuprate. I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack electrophilic centers. 

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me visualize its structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane derivative. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4, and 6. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in place of a bridge, so it's an epoxide ring. So, the structure probably has two rings with an oxygen connecting two carbons, making the epoxide.

The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a methyl cuprate. Organocuprates add to epoxides. I remember that when epoxides react with Grignard or cuprates, the nucleophile typically attacks the less substituted (less hindered) carbon of the epoxide. But wait, in the question, it says that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So, in a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon.

Wait, but I also recall that for epoxides with two different substituents, the nucleophile tends to attack the less substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic. So, if the epoxide is disubstituted, which means each oxygen is connected to two carbons, each with their own substituents, the attack would be on the less hindered carbon.

Also, the question mentions that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) is added. So, the configuration (R or S) at that carbon flips after the attack.

Let me sketch the structure of the given epoxide. The bicyclo system is a norbornene-like structure. The oxygen is at position 7, which is part of the bridge. The substituents are at 1,3,4,6. So, the epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6 (since 7 is the oxygen). Wait, no, in bicyclo systems, the numbering goes such that the bridgehead carbons are the lowest possible. So, perhaps the epoxide is between C1 and C6. Or maybe between C2 and C3? Wait, not entirely sure, but let's think about the structure.

Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But this is bicyclo[4.1.0], which is a different structure. Let me think: a bicyclo system with two bridge lengths of 4, 1, and 0. Wait, I think the structure is such that the epoxide bridges two carbons, making the ring. So, the epoxide is part of a 3-membered ring (epoxide) fused to another ring.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me imagine the molecule. The bicyclo [4.1.0]heptane would have a 4-membered ring, a 1-membered bridge (bridgehead?), and a 0, which I might not get right. Wait, no, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[x.y.z], where x, y, z are the bridge lengths, and x >= y >= z. So [4.1.0] implies three bridges: one of length 4, another of
