Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to find which products are formed based on the options given.

Hmm. So, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw the structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene, but wait, no. Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, but-3-en is CH2CH2CH=CH? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at position 3. So, positions are 1,2,3,4. So, 3-en means double bond is between 3 and 4. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me write it down.

The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but that can't be because but has four carbons. So, the correct structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No. Wait, but but-3-en-1-
