Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. Also, the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, commonly used to form complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed in a 1:1 molar ratio, I think. The formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−.

Wait, but when EDTA is in solution, it exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4− form, which is the one that complexes with metals effectively. So I don't need to worry about the protonation states here.

The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of CaEDTA²− as 0.02 M. Let's think about what happens when this complex dissociates.

The dissociation reaction is: CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

The formation constant K is given. Wait, but I think K for the formation is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaEDTA²−, and K would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = 5x10^10.

Wait, but when the complex dissociates, the K for dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant, right? Because the dissociation is the reverse reaction. So K_dissociation = 1/K_formation.

So K_dissociation = 1/(
