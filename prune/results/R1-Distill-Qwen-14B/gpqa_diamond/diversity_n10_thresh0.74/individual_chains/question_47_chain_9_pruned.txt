Okay, so I've got this question where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's break down what each part of the data tells me.

First, the IR data. Strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because those wavenumbers are typical for amines or amides. The medium to strong intensity suggests maybe a primary amine? Or maybe an amide, because amides have N-H stretches around there, but they're usually a bit lower. Wait, amide N-H is usually around 3300-3500, but the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl. Like maybe an amide or an ester or a ketone. But since the formula includes an O2, perhaps it's an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That's a typical ethyl group, probably CH2CH3. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so the neighboring group is a CH2.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet could be an -OCH2- group, maybe in an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a group with exchange, like an amine adjacent? Or maybe it's a CH2 near an electronegative atom.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet with 2H. That's another set of CH2 groups. Quartet suggests each proton is coupling with two protons on the adjacent group. So maybe another ethyl (CH2CH2?), but wait, the quartet's at 4.5, which is upfield. Quartet and 2Hâ€”could this be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group, like an ester? Like OCO-O-R, but wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait. Maybe the ester group is like R-O-CO-R'. The OCH2 might be part of an ethyl ester. Let me think: in an ethyl ester, the ethyl group is usually split into a triplet for the CH2CH3 and a quartet for the OCH2. So in the NMR, the ethyl ester would have triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3) and quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm (OCH2). Wait, here the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's another situation.

Wait, let's think about the integration. The 1.20 is 3H, which is the CH3 of an ethyl group. Then the quartet at 4.5 is 2H. Maybe that's the OCH2 group, part of an ester or an ether. If it's an ester, the structure would be OCH2CH2- something?

Wait, but the quartet at 4.5 suggests that each H is coupled with two others. So maybe the structure is OCH2CO- something. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom. Like an amide? Or perhaps an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

Then, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet could mean that the protons are exchanging, like in an -NH2 group, but the integration is 2H, which would fit a CH2NH group. Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, but the broadness makes me think of exchange, like NH. Wait, but if it's a CH2NH, would that be a singlet? Or perhaps it's an amide where the NH is split into a broad peak.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see, benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would add two carbons, making C9H11NO2. That fits. So the structure would be OCH2CH3 attached to the benzamide at the 3 position.

So, in that case, the NMR would show:

Ethoxy group: CH3OCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So in the ethyl group, the CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm. Then, the benzamide would have an amide proton, but wait, in benzamide, the NH is usually a broad peak. But in
