Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilic reactivity, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking me to arrange five nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive in an aqueous solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a different order.

First, I remember that the reactivity of nucleophiles depends on their ability to donate electrons. So, stronger bases are generally better nucleophiles. Also, the solvent plays a role. In aqueous solution (which is polar protic), nucleophilicity trends can be a bit different than in aprotic solvents.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS-)

Wait, but wait. Methanol is CH3OH, which is a neutral molecule, not a nucleophile because it's not deprotonated. Because in aqueous solution, it's unlikely to be a strong nucleophile. But the others are deprotonated, except maybe the propionate or something else?

Wait, no. Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid, so it's a weak base. Hmm. So the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution generally goes by basicity but also considering the solvation. In polar protic solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it is.

So, let's think about each nucleophile:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a cyclohexoxide ion. It's a strong base, similar to hydroxide but maybe less so. Wait, but the structure is a bulky base. Bulky bases are weaker because they're less likely to approach the electrophilic center.

Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity, I think strength as a base (basicity) is a primary factor in determining nucleophilicity in a polar aprotic solvent. But in polar protic, solvation is a big factor. For example, in aqueous solution, a more highly solvated ion would be a weaker nucleophile.

So, looking at the ions:

Hydroxide ion (OH-) is a strong base. But in water, it's heavily solvated. But compared to other ions, maybe it's a decent nucleophile.

Ethanethiolate (HS-): Thiolate ions are stronger bases than hydroxide. Because S is larger, the bond is weaker, so it's a better nucleophile. But wait, in aqueous solution, they are more polarizable and less solvated than OH-? Or more?

Wait, in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the ion's ability to be solvated. So, HS- is a weaker base than OH-? No, wait. Thiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide because S is less electronegative and holds the negative charge less tightly. So, HS- is a stronger base than OH-.

But in terms of nucleophilicity in a protic solvent, the order can be different because of solvation. For example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is something like: I- > Br- > Cl- > F-, but that's for halide ions.

Wait, but in this case, we have different types of ions. Let's list the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: O- with a bulky substituent. So, it's a strong base but perhaps hindered because of the bulky methyl groups? Or maybe the structure is such that it's a weaker base than OH-? Wait, no, the cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than, say, the propionate, because it's a conjugate base of a weaker acid.

Wait, let me think about the acids. The weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. So, 4-methylcyclohexanol would be a weaker acid than, say, propionic acid. Wait, propionic acid is a stronger acid than cyclohexanol? Because alcohols are generally weaker acids than carboxylic acids. So, the propionate ion (CH2CH2COO-) is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide. So, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than propionate.

Wait, but then again, the solvent is aqueous. So, the more polarizable the ion, the better the nucleophilicity in a protic solvent. Thiolate (HS-) is more polarizable than OH-, so maybe it's a better nucleophile in a protic solvent, despite being a stronger base.

Wait, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity (for common ions) is usually: RS- > I- > RO- > HO- > (others). But wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think: in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order (for some anions) is: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (because of decreasing solvation as size increases), but for O-containing ions, it's different.

Wait, another approach: the relative basicity of the nucleophiles. Stronger bases are better nucleophiles, but in a protic solvent, solvation can hinder that. So the order might not directly correlate with basicity in a protic solvent.

Let me list the nucleophiles and their basicities:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-): Strong base. Because S is less electronegative than O, the conjugate acid (ethanethiol) is weaker than water, so HS- is a stronger base than OH-.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Strong base, but weaker than HS-.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide. Alkoxides are strong bases, but compared to thiolate? I'm not sure. Wait, the conjugate acid of the cyclohexoxide is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Alcohols are weaker acids than thiols. So, the cyclohexanol is less acidic than ethanethiol. So, the cyclohexoxide is a weaker base than HS-, because its conjugate acid is weaker. Wait, wait: the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. So, if ethanethiol is a stronger acid than cyclohexanol, then HS- is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide? No, wait, no. Wait, the weaker the acid, the stronger the base. So, if ethanethiol is a stronger acid than cyclohexanol, then HS- is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide?

Wait, let me get this straight. If HA is the acid, then A- is the conjugate base. So, if HA is strong acid (more H+ released), then A- is a weak base. Conversely, if HA is a weak acid (holds onto H+), then A- is a strong base.

Ethanethiol (HS-H) is a stronger acid than water. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pKa of water is around 15.5; pKa of ethanethiol is around 10. So, ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water. So, HS- is a weaker base than OH-? Because the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. Wait, no, wait. Wait, water has pKa ~15.5; ethanethiol pKa ~10. So, ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water. Therefore, its conjugate base (HS-) is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Because I thought thiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. So which is correct?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If H2O has a higher pKa (weaker acid) than H-SH (ethanethiol), which has a lower pKa (stronger acid), then HS- is a weaker base than OH-. Because the stronger acid has a weaker conjugate base.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because S is less electronegative than O, so HS- is a stronger base than OH-. But the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, which is lower than that of water (15.5). So, ethanethiol is a stronger acid than water, making HS- a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, that doesn't align with my previous thought. Because I thought that because S is less electronegative, HS- is a stronger base than OH-. But according to the pKa, since H-SH is a stronger acid than H-OH, then HS- is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, that must be correct. So, the order of basicity among the given nucleophiles:

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-): pKa of H-SH is ~10, so HS- is a weaker base than OH- (pKa of H2O ~15.5). Wait, that can't be right. Because I remember that in general, thiolate ions are stronger bases than hydroxide. So, maybe the pKa is different.

Wait, maybe I got the pKa wrong. Let me think again. Wait, the pKa of H2O is about 15.5, and H-SH (ethanethiol) is about 10, so HS- is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, that would mean that OH- is a stronger base than HS-. But that can't be right because S is less electronegative than O, so it's easier to donate electrons.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: if a substance is a stronger acid, its conjugate base is weaker. So, H-SH is a stronger acid than H2O, which means HS- is a weaker base than OH-.

But that's conflicting with what I thought I knew. Alternatively, perhaps the pKa of HS- is lower (more acidic) than H2O. Wait, no, the HS- is the conjugate base of H-SH. So, if H-SH is a stronger acid (low pKa), then HS- is a weaker base.

So, this suggests that OH- is a stronger base than HS-.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. I thought thiolate is a stronger base. Let me look for another way. Let's compare the conjugate acids.

H2O has a pKa ~15.5.

H-SH (ethanethiol) pKa ~10.

So, since H-SH is a stronger acid, HS- is a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, that must mean that in the list, OH- is a stronger base than HS-.

But that's confusing because I thought the opposite. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, but also considering pKa of other substances. For example, compare methanol and propionic acid.

Methanol has a pKa around 19.7. Propionic acid is around 4.88. So, propionate (CH2CH2COO-) is a weaker base than methoxide (which would have a pKa ~ around 35 for CH3O-). So, the propionate is a weaker base than cyclohexoxide and HS- and OH-.

Wait, so the order of basicity (from strongest to weakest) would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (since it's an alkoxide, and the conjugate acid is a secondary alcohol, which is weaker than propionic acid, so the base is stronger than propionate but how does it compare to OH- and HS-?)

2. Hydroxide (OH-)

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-)

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought that HS- is a weaker base than OH- because H-SH is a stronger acid. So, in order of basicity:

Strongest base: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (since its conjugate acid is a weaker acid than H2O and H-SH).

Wait, no. Wait, 4-methylcyclohexanol's pKa is around, say, 19 (since alcohols are around 16-20 pKa). Wait, H2O is 15.5, so cyclohexanol would be around 19.7? Wait, maybe lower. Let me think: for example, cyclohexanol's pKa is about 20. So, its conjugate base (the cyclohexanolate) is a stronger base than OH- (which comes from water, pKa 15.5). So, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. So, cyclohexanol (pKa ~20) is a weaker acid than H2O (pKa 15.5), making its conjugate base (cyclohexanolate) a stronger base than OH-.

So, the order of basicity would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest base)
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
5. Ethanethiolate (weaker base than OH-)

Wait, no. Because earlier, I thought that HS- is a weaker base than OH- because H-SH is a stronger acid. So, cyclohexanolate is stronger base than OH-, and OH- is stronger than HS-.

Wait, then the order is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (strongest)
2. OH- (hydroxide)
5. HS- (ethanethiolate)
3. Propionate (weaker than all)
4. Methanol (neutral, so weakest as a nucleophile)

Wait, but wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is the conjugate base of propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). So, the propionate ion is a weak base. So, it's a weaker nucleophile than the others.

Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral molecule, so it's a poor nucleophile in aqueous solution because it's not deprotonated. So, it's the least reactive.

So, putting it all together, the order from most reactive (strongest nucleophile) to least:

First, the strongest base which is also the best nucleophile in aprotic solvents, but in aqueous solution, solvation can reduce nucleophilicity. However, in aqueous solution, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better it is.

Wait, so in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity isn't the same as basicity because of solvation effects.

In aqueous solution (polar protic), nucleophilicity tends to follow the trend where softer and less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. Thiolate (HS-) is less solvated than hydroxide because S is larger and less electronegative, so it's a better nucleophile in aqueous solution despite being a weaker base?

Wait, but earlier thought says HS- is a weaker base than OH- because H-SH is a stronger acid (lower pKa). So, in basicity, cyclohexanolate > OH- > HS- > propionate.

But in nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, maybe HS- is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated.

Wait, I remember that in protic solvents, the order is different. For example, iodide is a better nucleophile in protic solvents than in aprotic because the larger ion is less solvated.

So, applying this, in aqueous solution, HS- is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated (since S is larger and more polarizable).

Wait, but wait, HS- is a weaker base, but in a protic solvent, it's a better nucleophile. So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous would be:

HS- > OH- > cyclohexanolate (maybe?) but wait, cyclohexanolate is a bulky base.

Wait, but the cyclohexanolate is a bulky ion. Bulky nucleophiles are less effective in SN2 reactions because of steric hindrance, but in SN1, they can be better. But in terms of overall nucleophilicity in solution, steric hindrance reduces their reactivity.

So, comparing the five nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: bulky, strong base, so in aprotic solvents it's a good nucleophile, but in aqueous solution, may be less reactive due to steric hindrance and solvation.

2. OH-: strong base, but in aqueous solution, highly solvated, so maybe not the best nucleophile.

3. Propionate: weaker base, less nucleophilic.

4. Methanol: neutral, poor nucleophile.

5. HS-: weaker base than OH-, but in aqueous solution, less solvated than OH- because S is larger, so better nucleophile.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find a way to rank them.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity (from best to worst) is often:

Ethanethiolate (HS-) > Hydroxide (OH-) > (other weak bases) > Methanol.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the cyclohexanolate here. Because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, but in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, HS- is better than OH- because it's less solvated.

So, the order in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous would be:

5 (HS-) > 2 (OH-) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

Wait, but cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH- (since its conjugate acid is weaker), but in aqueous solution, because of solvation, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is less nucleophilic than OH-? Or more?

Wait, no, because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH-, but in a protic solvent, solvation could reduce its nucleophilicity. But OH- is solvated but perhaps less so than the cyclohexanolate?

Wait, the cyclohexanolate is a larger ion? No, cyclohexanolate is a bigger ion because it's a larger molecule. So, perhaps it's less solvated than OH-, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Wait, but wait, comparing solvation: smaller ions are more solvated. OH- is smaller than the cyclohexanolate, so OH- is more solvated, making it a worse nucleophile in aqueous solution. So, the cyclohexanolate, being a larger ion, is less solvated, so it's a better nucleophile.

So, in that case, the order would be:

1 (cyclohexanolate) > 5 (HS-) > 2 (OH-) > 3 (propionate) > 4 (methanol).

But wait, that can't be right. Because I thought that in aqueous solution, HS- is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated.

Wait, but cyclohexanolate is a stronger base and a larger ion, so less solvated. So, it's more nucleophilic than both HS- and OH-.

Wait, but that would make the order:

1 >5>2>3>4.

But looking at the options, the options are A, B, C, D.

Let me look at the options again:

Option A: 5, 2, 3, 1,4

Option B: 2,5,1,4,3

Option D:5,2,1,3,4

Wait, the correct order according to my latest thought is 1,5,2,3,4.

But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on basicity, but considering some other factors.

Wait, another thought: nucleophilicity in a protic solvent is usually inversely proportional to the ion's ability to be solvated. So, the less solvated the nucleophile, the better it is.

So, the least solvated would be the largest ion. So, cyclohexanolate is a larger ion than OH- and HS-. So, it's less solvated. Hence, more nucleophilic.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (least solvated, so best nucleophile)
5. Ethanethiolate (next, as S is larger than O)
2. Hydroxide (O- is smaller, more solvated)
3. Propionate (weaker base, more solvated)
4. Methanol (neutral, least reactive)

Wait, but wait, this would make the order: 1,5,2,3,4.

Looking at the options, none have this order. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is based on the strength of the base, but considering their solvation in aqueous.

Wait, another approach: in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity for O- and S- nucleophiles is S- > O- because S is less electronegative and more polarizable, making them better nucleophiles despite being weaker bases.

So, in the given options, HS- is a weaker base than OH- (since H-SH is a stronger acid), but in aqueous solution, it's a better nucleophile. So, order would be:

5 > 2 > 1 > 3 >4.

Wait, but what about the cyclohexanolate?

Wait, cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH- (since its conjugate acid is weaker). So, in aprotic solvents, it would be a better nucleophile than OH-.

In aqueous solution, because it's more bulky and less solvated, perhaps it's a better nucleophile than OH-.

So, the order would be:

5 (HS-) is a weaker base than 1 (cyclohexanolate), but in aqueous solution, what matters more is solvation.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to think of the options.

Looking at the given options, the options are:

A) 5,2,3,1 and4

B) 2,5,1,4,3

C) 2,5,3,4,3 → probably a typo, as 3 and 4 are same.

D)5,2,1,3 and4

So, the possible orderings are:

Option D: 5, 2,1,3,4.

Which would mean:

Ethanethiolate > Hydroxide > cyclohexanolate > propionate > methanol.

But according to my earlier thought, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the relative strength of the nucleophiles in a polar protic solvent.

In general, in polar protic solvents:

The trend is: I- > Br- > Cl- > F- (for halides), and S- > O- (for similar ions). So, in this case, HS- is better than OH-.

But the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH-, so in aprotic solvent, it's a better nucleophile. But in protic, because it's less solvated, it's a better nucleophile than OH-.

So, the order in aqueous would be: cyclohexanolate (as it's a stronger base and less solvated) is better than HS-.

Wait, but that would make the order: 1>5>2>3>4, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on the strength of the base, regardless of solvent. But that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about how each nucleophile is typically ranked.

Ethanethiolate (HS-) is a stronger base than hydroxide (OH-). Wait, no, earlier I thought that H-SH is a stronger acid (lower pKa), making HS- a weaker base than OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should list the pKa values:

- Ethanethiol (HS-H): pKa ~10.
- Water (H-O-H): pKa ~15.5.
- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~20.

So, the conjugate bases:

- HS- (pKa 10)
- OH- (pKa 15.5)
- 4-methylcyclohexanolate (pKa 20)

So, the order of basicity (strongest to weakest) is:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate (pKa 20)
2. OH- (pKa 15.5)
5. HS- (pKa 10)

Wait, but wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a higher pKa means the conjugate base is stronger. So, if 4-methylcyclohexanol has a higher pKa (~20), its conjugate base is stronger than OH- (pKa 15.5). So, the order is 1>2>5.

Now, in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution:

Nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents tends to favor larger, less solvated ions, regardless of basicity. So, HS- (S is larger) is less solvated than OH- and is a better nucleophile.

But wait, cyclohexanolate is even larger than HS-. So, it's less solvated than both OH- and HS-.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous would be:

1 (cyclohexanolate) >5 (HS-) >2 (OH-) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: 5,2,1,3,4 → Ethanethiolate, OH-, cyclohexanolate, propionate, methanol.

Hmm, that's 5>2>1>3>4.

But according to our analysis, cyclohexanolate is more nucleophilic than HS-.

So, perhaps the correct order is 1,5,2,3,4, but that's not an option. So, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is a weaker nucleophile than HS- and OH- due to steric hindrance. Because the cyclohexanolate is a bulky ion, it's less reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions, even though it's a strong base.

So, in that case, the order would be:

HS- (5) > OH- (2) > cyclohexanolate (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4)

But I'm not sure about that. Because steric factors can play a big role in reactivity.

Wait, but cyclohexanolate is a strong base, but if it's too bulky, it can't approach the electrophilic center as well as a smaller ion like OH-.

So, in terms of nucleophilic substitution reactions, maybe the order is HS- > OH- > cyclohexanolate.

But wait, the question is about nucleophilic reactivity in aqueous solution, not just in SN2 reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is ranking them based on their nucleophilicity in general, not considering steric factors.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another angle.

Another approach: the nucleophilicity in aqueous solution is influenced by how well the ion can shed its solvent molecules. The more tightly the solvent molecules are held around the ion, the less nucleophilic it is.

So, the cyclohexanolate is a larger ion. So, it's more polarizable and less tightly solvated, making it a better nucleophile in aqueous solution.

Thus, the order would be:

1 (cyclohexanolate) >5 (HS-) >2 (OH-) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol)

But looking at the options, none of them have this order.

Wait, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So, 5 comes first, then 2, then 1. So, that would suggest that HS- is the most reactive, followed by OH-, then cyclohexanolate, then propionate, then methanol.

This would make sense if in aqueous solution, HS- is a better nucleophile than OH- because it's less solvated, and cyclohexanolate is more reactive than propionate.

Wait, but why is cyclohexanolate ranked third, after OH- and HS-?

Because in terms of basicity, cyclohexanolate is the strongest base, but in terms of aqueous nucleophilicity, perhaps it's not as good as HS- and OH- because of steric hindrance.

So, maybe the correct order is HS- > OH- > cyclohexanolate > propionate > methanol.

But looking at the options, option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

Which would mean: 5 (HS-) is most reactive, then 2 (OH-), then 1 (cyclohexanolate), then 3 (propionate), then 4 (methanol).

That would fit if the order is indeed HS- > OH- > cyclohexanolate.

So, perhaps I should go with option D.


The reactivity of nucleophiles in aqueous solution depends on their basicity, polarizability, and solvation effects. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is influenced by how well the nucleophile is solvated: less solvated nucleophiles are generally more reactive. Additionally, larger, more polarizable ions (e.g., thiolates) are often better nucleophiles in aqueous solutions due to their reduced solvation.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a bulky alkoxide ion and a strong base due to its conjugate acid (4-methylcyclohexanol) having a relatively high pKa (~20). However, its bulkiness can hinder its reactivity in nucleophilic substitution reactions, even though it is less solvated than smaller ions like hydroxide.

2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base with a pKa of ~15.5 for water. In aqueous solution, hydroxide is highly solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity compared to less solvated ions like thiolate.

3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weak base derived from propionic acid (pKa ~4.88). It is a poor nucleophile due to its weak basicity and significant solvation in water.

4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule, making it a very poor nucleophile in aqueous solution as it cannot donate electrons effectively.

5. **Ethanethiolate (HS⁻)**: A thiolate ion derived from ethanethiol (pKa ~10). Thiolate ions are less solvated than hydroxide due to the larger size and polarizability of sulfur, making them better nucleophiles in aqueous solutions despite being weaker bases.

### Ranking the Nucleophiles:
- **Most reactive**: Ethanethiolate (HS⁻) is the best nucleophile due to its polarizability and reduced solvation in water.
- **Second**: Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a strong base but is heavily solvated, making it less reactive than ethanethiolate.
- **Third**: 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate, despite being a strong base, is hindered by steric bulk and solvation.
- **Fourth**: Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻) is a weak base and a poor nucleophile.
- **Least reactive**: Methanol (CH₃OH), being neutral, is the poorest nucleophile.

### Correct Order:
**5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)**.

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
