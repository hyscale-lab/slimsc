Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, you can find the pH at different points like the equivalence point and specific percentages of titration.

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

So, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.05 M is 0.05 moles per 0.001 liters. Wait, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed would be the same as moles of acetic acid because it's a 1:1 reaction. So moles NaOH = 0.001. 

Volume of NaOH at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, the volume is 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, what's the nature of the solution at equivalence? Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. At equivalence, they react to form the sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water.

So to find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. 

First, the concentration of sodium acetate. The total volume at equivalence is the initial acetic acid
