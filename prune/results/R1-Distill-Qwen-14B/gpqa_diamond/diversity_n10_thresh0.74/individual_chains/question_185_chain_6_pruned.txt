Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me take it step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Right, σ is a vector of the three Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in any direction, but it's normalized. So the dot product here means that each component of σ is multiplied by the corresponding component of n, and then summed up.

Wait, so more precisely, σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And H is ε times that. Since ε is an energy constant, the units make sense because each Pauli matrix is dimensionless, I think. So the product has units of energy.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. Eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the equation H |ψ> = E |ψ>, where E is the eigenvalue.

I remember that Pauli matrices have some specific properties. Each Pauli matrix is Hermitian, which means they have real eigenvalues. Also, each Pauli matrix squared gives the identity matrix multiplied by something. Like σ_x² is the identity matrix times 1, same for σ_y and σ_z.

Wait, right! Because each Pauli matrix σ_i satisfies σ_i² = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So for any linear combination of them, like a·σ, the square would be (
