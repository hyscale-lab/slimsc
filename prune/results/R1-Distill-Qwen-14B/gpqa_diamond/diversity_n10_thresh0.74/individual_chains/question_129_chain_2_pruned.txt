Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a reaction scheme with compounds A through E. Let's break down each step.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to make D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E. 

There are also some hints provided. Hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with aldehydes or ketones. So that suggests that compound A is a carbonyl compound because that's what the Wittig reagent reacts with.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The structure of this compound would have a cyclopentane ring. The substituents are two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a CH2-C(CH3)= group, right? Because propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2, but when it's a ylidene, like in the Wittig, it's CH2-C(CH3)=.

So the Wittig product probably came from a ketone. Because the Wittig reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So if compound A is a ketone, then reacting with the ylide would give an alkene.

Wait, the structure after Wittig has a double bond. So the product is 4-substituted cyclopentane with a double bond. Let's imagine the structure. It's cyclopentane with substituents at 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). So the propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane.

So the starting material A must have been a ketone that's part of a cyclopentane or similar ring. Because when the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a ketone, it would form the double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl and 4-(propan-2-ylidene). So the starting ketone would have been attached to the cyclopentane. Let's think: the Wittig reaction would take the carbonyl (from ketone) and replace it with the ylidene group. So the product would have a double bond where the carbonyl was.

So, in the product, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 (but wait, cyclopentane is a five-membered ring; positions 1,2,3,4,5 in order). The substituents are at 1,
