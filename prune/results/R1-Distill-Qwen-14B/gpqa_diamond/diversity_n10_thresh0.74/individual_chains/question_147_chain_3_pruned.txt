Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are from A to D, with various velocities, all in terms of c.

Hmm, okay. Annihilation processes usually involve matter and antimatter particles annihilating each other. Protons and antiprotons annihilating into other particles. So in this case, they produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Interesting.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe the system is nearly at rest? Or at least, the initial momentum isn't too high. Wait, but wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the initial system's total energy would be rest mass energy of the proton plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest mass, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². But wait, in that case, the rest mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c², so m_p c² is about 938 MeV. But m_A c² is 300 MeV, so each A is lighter than a proton. Wait, that's interesting.

Wait, the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. So each of those has mass 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass of the products would be 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial system has a proton and an antiproton, each 938 MeV. So 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest energy is 1876 MeV, and the products are 1200 MeV. So the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products, which probably means there's enough energy to create the particles, and some kinetic energy left over.

But wait, the process is annihilation, so perhaps it's creating new particles. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy and momentum. Maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is presumably at rest? Or is the proton also moving? Hmm, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. So the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

So, initial energy: E_initial = E_p + E_p̄. The proton is at rest, so E_p = m_p c². The antiproton has kinetic energy, which is small because it's moving slowly. So E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + K
