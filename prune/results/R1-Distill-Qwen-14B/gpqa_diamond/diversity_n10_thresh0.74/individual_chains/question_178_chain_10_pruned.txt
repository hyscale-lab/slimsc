Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the gamma matrices γ have certain mass dimensions. Wait, in four spacetime dimensions, each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because the Dirac matrices are usually treated as dimensionless in 4D.

So, let's break down the terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ = c =1), so the integral over four dimensions (d^4 x) has dimension [mass]^−4. Hence, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. Let's look at each part of L_int: κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

First, let's find the mass dimension of each field. The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the equation of motion for ψ is a derivative (∂_μ) which has dimension 1, so (i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ) must be dimension 4 (since it's part of the kinetic term ∫ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ d^4x, which is dimension 4). So ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ should also be 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. Since each gamma is dimensionless, σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Oh, that's important.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, no, but in this case, since the Lagrangian involves F, which is the field tensor, it's similar to the Maxwell term. The field strength tensor F_{μν} is made from ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A field is a vector potential, which has dimension 1. So F_{μν} has dimension 2, because each derivative is dimension 1, and F is two derivatives acting on A. Wait, so F^{μν} would have dimension 2.

Alternatively, perhaps F^{μν} is the same as F_{μν} in terms of dimension because it's just the contravariant form, same dimension.

So putting it all together: the term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me compute the mass dimension. Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 = 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the whole term is κ multiplied by this, which is dimension 5. So for the Lagrangian to have dimension 4, κ must have dimension [4] - [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4 -5= -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I might be making a mistake in the dimensions. Let's see:

- ψ̄ has [3/2], ψ has [3/2], so ψ̄ ψ is [3], correct.
- Then F^{μν} has [2], because each derivative is [1], and F is ∂A, so each F is [1] + [A] = 1
