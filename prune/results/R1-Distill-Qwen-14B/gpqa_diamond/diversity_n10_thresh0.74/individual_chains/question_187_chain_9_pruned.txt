Okay, so I've got this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The question lists several stars and asks how many would be detectable based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options meet this criterion.

First, I should probably understand what factors affect the S/N ratio in spectroscopy. I remember that S/N generally depends on the brightness of the object, the exposure time, and the instrumental factors like the efficiency of the telescope and spectrograph. So, the brighter the star (lower apparent magnitude), the higher the S/N.

The question gives me several stars with different distances and absolute magnitudes. Absolute magnitude is a measure of a star's intrinsic brightness, but apparent magnitude depends on both absolute magnitude and distance. So I'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star to determine how bright they appear from Earth.

The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5, where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. So for each star, I can plug in their distance and calculate apparent magnitude.

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can figure out the flux received from the star. Since S/N ratio depends on flux, more flux means higher S/N. But I'm not exactly sure how to convert apparent magnitude to flux. I remember that the magnitude scale is such that a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 100 in flux. The formula for flux ratio is F2/F1 = 10^((m1 - m2)/5). So, if a star has a certain apparent magnitude, its flux compared to a reference star can be calculated.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to go through flux ratios. I recall that the S/N ratio for a spectrograph depends on the number of photons collected. The number of photons is proportional to the exposure time, the collecting area of the telescope, and the flux from the star. The ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity and the telescope's collecting area would play a role here.

But perhaps I can look for a way to determine if each star's apparent brightness is sufficient to reach the required S/N of 10. I remember that very bright stars (like Canopus) are easier to detect because they are brighter, so their S/N would be higher. Faint stars might not reach the threshold.

Let me list out the stars:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Abs. V mag 15, distance 10 pc
d) Abs. V mag 15, distance 200 pc
e) Abs. V mag 15, distance 5 pc
f) Abs. V mag 15, distance 50 pc

I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each of these.

Starting with Canopus (a). Canopus is a bright star. I think its apparent magnitude is around
