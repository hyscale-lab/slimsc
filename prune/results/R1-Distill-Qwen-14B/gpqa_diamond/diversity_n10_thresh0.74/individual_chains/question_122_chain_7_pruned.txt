Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Let me try to break down each step carefully.

First, let's go through each reaction step by step to figure out what each product is.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that acetic anhydride is often used as a acetylating agent. When acetic acid reacts with bromine and pyridine, which is a catalyst, I think it's a bromination reaction. Wait, wait! Pyridine is used to absorb the HBr generated in such reactions, making the reaction go more smoothly. Oh right, this is the formation of an acyl bromide. So acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with excess acetic anhydride and Br2 in the presence of pyridine probably forms acetyl bromide, which is CH3COBr. So product 1 is acetyl bromide.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Okay, so when an acyl bromide reacts with an alcohol, it's an nucleophilic acyl substitution. Heating with ethanol and H2SO4 would likely be a Fischer esterification, but wait, since we have an acyl bromide, maybe it's more like the bromide leaving and the alcohol attacking. So acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) would give ethyl acetate (CH3COOCH2CH3) and HBr. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Wait, but wait, does the presence of H2SO4 change anything? Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, maybe it protonates the hydroxyl group of the alcohol, making it a better nucleophile. So yes, the reaction is more likely to proceed as a nucleophilic substitution. So product 2 is ethyl acetate, correct.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. So ethyl acetate reacting with NaCN. Hmm, I'm trying to remember. Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile. In the case of esters, perhaps it would perform a substitution. Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution again. The ester group (OR) is attacked by the CN- ion, replacing the OR group with OCN-. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a transesterification? Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis, but under what conditions? Or maybe it's a substitution where the leaving group is the acetate part.

Wait, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. When treated with NaCN, which is in a polar aprotic solvent maybe? I think in such conditions, the ester can undergo substitution. So the mechanism would be the CN- attacking the carbonyl carbon, pushing the oxygen to leave. Wait, but the leaving group in an ester is the OR group. So, the OR (which is OCH2CH3) could leave, but that's a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is first converted into a better leaving group. Or maybe it's more likely to undergo a substitution where the OR is replaced by OCN.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is hydrolyzed under basic conditions. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are strong nucleophiles. So, the reaction would proceed with the CN- attacking the carbonyl carbon, leading to the substitution of the OR group. So, the product would be CH3COONaCN? Or maybe it's CH3COCN? No, wait. Wait, the structure of ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OCH2CH3. Nucleophilic attack by CN- would substitute the OCH2CH3 group, leading to CH3COCN, which is acetonitrile? No, wait. Wait, no, acetonitrile is CH3CN. Oh wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, if the CN- attacks the carbonyl, the OCH2CH3 would leave as a leaving group. But OCH2CH3 is a poor leaving group. So perhaps the mechanism is that the CN- attacks the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the OCH2CH3 group departs as a leaving group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe under basic conditions, the CN- could deprotonate something, but I'm not certain.

Wait another angle: when an ester reacts with CN- (like in a substitution), perhaps it forms a nitrile. So, the ester group (like OCH2CH3) is replaced by CN. So ethyl acetate would become CH3COCN? But that structure doesn't make sense. Wait, CH3CO-OCH2CH3 would become CH3COCN?

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a substitution where the OR is replaced by OCN. So, the product would be CH3CO-O-CN? That doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the product is CH3CN (acetonitrile), but how?

Wait, perhaps the ethyl acetate is being converted into a methyl ester or something else. Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the reaction again. When an ester (like ethyl acetate) reacts with CN-, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution, leading to the formation of an acyl cyanide. So, the product would be CH3COCN, which is acrylonitrile? No, wait that's different. Wait, CH3COCN is methyl cyanide? No, maybe it's another structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions. Wait, but NaCN is a base. So, perhaps the ester is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, but with CN- as the base? Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the OR group is replaced by OCN. So, the product would be CH3CO-O-CN, which is acetylcyanide. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transesterification. But with NaCN, which is a source of CN- and maybe a base, perhaps it's more likely a substitution. So if product 3 is CH3CO-CN, that's acetonitrile (CH3CN) but wait, that's not correct. Because CH3CO-CN would have the structure O=C(NC)-OCH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH3C(O)CN. Wait, that's an acyl cyanide. So, product 3
