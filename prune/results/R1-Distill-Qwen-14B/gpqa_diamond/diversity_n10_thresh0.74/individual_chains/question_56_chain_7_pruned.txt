Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, the electric dipole selection rules. The main ones are that Δl must be ±1 (so the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit), and Δm can be 0, ±1. Also, the transition is forbidden if l' = 0 (like s orbitals) because the dipole can't connect to them, but wait, wait, wait. No, wait, l can go to l±1. So for a state with l=0, like n=1, l=0, m=0, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so l=0, m=0. So from l=0, the only possible transitions would be to l=1, because l can't go to -1. So first transition must go from 3,0,0 to some state with l=1.

So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1, something? Or maybe 3,0,0 → 2,1,0? Wait, let me think. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so n=3, l=0, m=0. So when it transitions via dipole, it must go to a state where l=1, because l can only change by ±1. So the next state after transition must have l=1.

So the possible states after the first transition would have l=1, so their m can be -1, 0, +1. So the first transition could be to |n',1,m⟩, where m is -1,0, +1. But the initial state's m is 0, so the m of the first transition can change by 0, ±1.

Wait, but the final state after two transitions is |1,0,0⟩. So after the first transition, the state must be |something,1,m⟩ which can then transition down to |1,0,0⟩. So the second transition must take l=1 to l=0.

Ah, so
