Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The problem says it's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so the formula is probably CaY²- or something like that.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, but wait. The question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh, right, because when EDTA complexes with calcium, the free Ca²+ concentration is going to be really low.

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I think the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-} ).

But in this case, the solution contains the complex, and we need to find [Ca²+]. Let's see, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I can think that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

At equilibrium, some of that complex might dissociate, but wait, since K is so large (5e10), that's a very strong complex. So the dissociation would be minimal. But we can't just ignore it entirely; we need to calculate it.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is very large. That means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be very low.

The complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M. Since the complex formation is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²−, the initial concentrations are:

Initially, [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA^4-] = 0, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

But wait, no. Wait, when the complex is formed, the initial concentrations would be based on the dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the system.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as
