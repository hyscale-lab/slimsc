Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide, and then analyzing the TLC results to determine the products.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to draw that structure. So, benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Breaking that down: the butenyl group is four carbons long, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me think. The substituents are on the butenyl group. So, position 1 is where it's connected to oxygen. The structure would be:

O

O-benzene-(CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2?), wait no, wait. Wait, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, right? So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-O-... Wait no, wait. Let me write it properly.

Butenyl groups are four carbons with a double bond. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, that's not possible because but-3-enyl would have to be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond can't be at position 3 for four carbons. Oh wait, butenyl is four carbons, so numbering starts at the end where the substituent is attached. So but-3-en-1-yl would be:

Position 1: connected to oxygen. Then positions 2, 3, 4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that doesn't make sense because that's beyond the chain. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's think: butenyl is four carbons. For but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. That can't be right because that would be beyond the fourth carbon. Wait, maybe I'm
