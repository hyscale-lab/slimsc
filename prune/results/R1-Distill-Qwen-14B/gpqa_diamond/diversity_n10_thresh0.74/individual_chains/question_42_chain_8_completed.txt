Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. I remember that orbital period relates to the distance from the star and the star's mass, maybe using Kepler's third law. But wait, the problem gives information about equilibrium temperatures and masses. Let's see.

So, the setup: there are three planets, Planet1, 2, 3. They were discovered via the TTV method, which I think is transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The given data:

- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 ≈ 1.4.
- Between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. Wait, no, because the way it's worded, the ratio of Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times higher than T3. So T2 = 2.3 * T3.

Wait no, the first ratio is between 1 and 2 as 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So T1 = 1.4 T2. And T2 is 2.3 times T3? Wait no, let me get this right. The ratio of Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2=1.4 => T1=1.4 T2. Then the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so T2/T3=2.3 => T2=2.3 T3. So T1=1.4 * 2.3 T3=3.22 T3. So overall, the temperatures are T1=3.22*T3, T2=2.3*T3, T3=T3.

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L*(1 - a)/(16πσ D^2))^0.5, where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the orbital distance. Since all three have the same albedo (0.3), that term is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/2). Or, more simply, T is proportional to sqrt(L/(D²)) ) = sqrt(L) / D.

Alternatively, T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). Because T² ∝ L/(D²), so T ∝ sqrt(L)/D. Wait, no, let's get the exact relation. The formula is T ≈ (L*(1-a)/(16πσ D²))^(1/4). Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law is P = σT^4, and equilibrium condition is L*(1-a)/4 = σT^4. So T^4 = L*(1-a)/(4σ) * (1/D²). So T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4) = (L)^(1/4) * D^(-1/2).

So T ∝ sqrt(sqrt(L)) / sqrt(D). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the ratio.

So, for two planets, say 1 and 2:

(T1)/(T2) = [ (L / D1² ) / (L / D2²) ) ]^(1/4) * (1 - a)/(1 - a) is same, so cancels.

Wait, wait, let's write T1 = T_eq1 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D1²) ]^(1/4 )

Similarly, T2 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D2²) ]^(1/4 )

So the ratio T1/T2 = [ (D2²) / (D1²) ]^(1/4 ) = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Because when you take the ratio, it's (D2^2/D1^2)^(1/4) = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2).

We have, from the given data, T1/T2 = 1.4, so 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides: 1.96 = D2/D1. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Square both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

We already have D2 = 1.96 D1. So D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1.

Let me calculate 5.29 *1.96.

5 *1.96=9.8; 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684. So 9.8 + 0.5684 = ~10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 D1.

So D3 is about 10.37 times D1.

Now, the next part is about the orbital periods. Kepler's third law states that (P^2) ∝ (D^3)/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Wait, actually, the exact formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) * D^3. But if the planet masses are much smaller than the star, M >> m, so M + m ≈ M. So the formula simplifies to P² ∝ D³ / M.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention the star's mass. Hmm. Wait, are the masses of the planets given? Let me check. The problem says the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, so m2 = 1.15 m1. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 1.35, so m3 =1.35 m2 = 1.35 *1.15 m1 = about 1.5525 m1.

Wait, but how does planet mass affect the orbital period? Well, in Kepler's third law, the period depends on the mass of the star and the mass of the planet. But wait, no—Kepler's law for planets is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (D³ (M + m)) ), where M is the star's mass and m is the planet's mass. But in most cases, m is negligible, so M + m ≈ M. Therefore, the period P is determined by the distance D and the star's mass M, and the planet's mass m doesn't significantly affect the period. So maybe the masses given here (Planet1, 2,3) don't matter for the period. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15. So m2 = 1.15 m1. Similarly, m3 =1.35 m2 = 1.35 *1.15 m1 = 1.5525 m1. So the planets' masses are increasing, but how does that affect their orbital periods?

Wait, but if all planets are orbiting the same star, then the star's mass M is the same for all. So the period of each planet depends only on D and M. Therefore, the period P is given by:

P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (D³ (M + m) )

But when the planet's mass m is much less than M (which is typical), (M + m) ≈ M, so P² ∝ D³ / M.

But since M is the same for all, the ratio of periods squared is the cube of the ratio of distances.

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). Because P ~ D^(3/2). 

We have D3/D1 ≈ 10.37. So P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, let's calculate that. 10.37^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.37)^3.

The square root of 10 is about 3.162, and sqrt(10.37) is a bit higher, say approximately 3.22.

So 3.22^3 = ?

Calculate 3^3 =27. 0.22^3 is about 0.0106. But wait, 3.22 *3.22= (3.2)^2 + (0.02)^2 + ... wait, 3.22 squared is 3.22 *3.22.

Let me compute 3.22 * 3.22: 3 *3=9, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22 *3=0.66, 0.22*0.22=0.0484. So 9 + 0.66 +0.66 +0.0484 = 9 +1.32 +0.0484 = 10.3684. So 3.22^2=10.3684. Then 3.22^3 = 3.22 * 10.3684 ≈ 3.22 *10.3684.

What's 3 *10.3684=31.1052, 0.22 *10.3684≈2.281. So total approx 33.386. So 3.22^3 ≈33.386.

So P3/P1 is approximately 33.386, which is about 33.4. So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times longer than Planet1.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Equilibrium Temperatures**:  
   The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( \sqrt{\sqrt{L} / D} \), where \( L \) is the star's luminosity and \( D \) is the orbital distance. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
   \]  
   From the problem:  
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), so \( \sqrt{D_2 / D_1} = 1.4 \), which gives \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \).  
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \), so \( \sqrt{D_3 / D_2} = 2.3 \), which gives \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \).  

   Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \), we find:  
   \[
   D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.37 D_1
   \]  
   Thus, \( D_3 \) is approximately 10.37 times \( D_1 \).

2. **Orbital Periods**:  
   Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is related to the orbital distance \( D \) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto D^3
   \]  
   Since all planets orbit the same star, the ratio of periods squared is proportional to the cube of the ratio of distances:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.37 \):  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
   \]  
   Approximating \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   (10.37)^{3/2} = (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4
   \]  

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
