Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity of radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, right? And the radius of the cavity is smaller than R, so r < R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are bigger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor, so L > R. Since the conductor is uncharged, but we have a charge inside the cavity, I remember that in such cases, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge. Oh wait, right! When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q if the conductor was initially neutral. Wait no, the conductor was uncharged, so the net charge is zero. So the inner surface must have +q, no wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If you have a positive charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the positive charge attracts negative charges on the cavity's inner wall. But the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q to balance. Because the total induced charge on the inner surface is -q, so the outer surface must be +q to make the total conductor's charge zero (since it was initially uncharged).

Wait, no, hold on. The conductor was uncharged, so the sum of the charges on inner and outer surfaces must be zero. If the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q. But wait, the outer is the outside of the conductor. So any charge on the outer surface would be the conductor's own charge. But since the conductor was uncharged, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the outer is +q, making the total zero. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so when considering the electric field at P, only the charges outside the conductor contribute. So the outer surface's charge +q will create an electric field at P. But wait, the charge distribution on the outer surface would be as if the charge was on a point at the center, right? Because for a spherical conductor, any charge on the outer surface can be considered to be at the center for electric field purposes outside the sphere. So the field at point P would be as if all the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. So using Coulomb's law, the electric field should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Because the charge on the outer surface is +q, and when outside a sphere, the field is as if the charge is a point charge
