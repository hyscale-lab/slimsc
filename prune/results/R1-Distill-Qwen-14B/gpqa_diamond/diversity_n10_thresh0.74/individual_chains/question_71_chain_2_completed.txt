Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^1/4, wait no, that's probably more detailed than needed.

Wait, the formula I think I should use is the one where the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital period, assuming all else is equal. Because the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo are the same here. Oh wait, but wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, so their periods are related. Let me see.

The question states that the planets have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The further out, the cooler. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * (R / (2a)) )^0.5, but wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the period and the star's properties. Alternatively, the formula might be T = (L / (16πσ a²))^0.25. Because the flux received is L/(4πa²), and the planet emits as a blackbody with radius R: σT^4 = L/(4πa²) * (πR²)/(4πσR²) ) wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature can be calculated using the formula:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_sun / (2a)) )

But perhaps a simpler approach is to realize that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Since the periods are in a certain ratio, and for circular orbits, the semi-major axis is proportional to the period (from Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³, wait no, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) a³, so a³ ∝ P². So a ∝ P^(2/3). So the semi-major axis is proportional to the period raised to the 2/3 power.

So if Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 P1, and Planet_2 has period 2 P1, then the semi-major axes are a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * a1, and a2 = (2)^(2/3) * a1.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The formula from Kepler's third law is P^2 ∝ a^3, so a ∝ P^(2/3). Yes, because a³ = (G*M*P²)/(4π²), so a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to their period raised to the 2/3 power.

So the distance a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Now, equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Because the flux is inversely proportional to a squared, and T is proportional to (flux/(sigma))^1/4, which brings in a factor of 1/a^0.5.

So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a) = 1/(a^(1/2)).

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then T ∝ 1/( (P^(2/3))^(1/2) ) = 1/( P^(1/3) ).

So T is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Alternatively, T ∝ P^(-1/3).

So the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me get that right. Because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so T4 is proportional to 1/(P4^(1/3)), and T2 is 1/(P2^(1/3)). So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) ?

Wait let me compute this:

T4 = k / (P4)^(1/3)

T2 = k / (P2)^(1/3)

So T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)

Yes.

In the problem, P2 is 2 * P1, and P4 is 3.5 * P1.

So P2 = 2, P4 = 3.5.

So the ratio becomes (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).

Let me compute that.

2/3.5 is equal to 4/7 approximately 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3). What is that approximately?

Cube of 0.8 is 0.512. 0.83^3 is about 0.83 *0.83 = 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.571. So (0.83)^3 is about 0.571, which is 4/7.

So (4/7)^(1/3) is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83.

So looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises from Kepler's third law, which connects the orbital period and semi-major axis, and the inverse square law for stellar flux.

Given the orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we denote Planet_1's period as \( P_1 \). Thus, Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} \), we get \( \frac{2}{3.5} \approx 0.571 \). Taking the cube root of \( 0.571 \), we find \( \left(0.571\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**
