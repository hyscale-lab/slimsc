Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit this property. Let me go through each of them one by one.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers have four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Alternatively, some molecules might have other forms of asymmetry, like allene or helical structures, but I think for this question, focusing on chiral centers should suffice.

Let's look at each option:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, this is a biphenyl compound with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The central biphenyl is connected in a way that the two phenyl groups are attached at position 1. Now, the substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' and carbonyl ester groups (from the dicarboxylate) at 2,2'. Wait, so each ring has a nitro and a carbonyl group. But wait, the ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions. So each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. 

Now, can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two phenyl rings are connected at 1,1', and each has substituents at 2 and 6, which are symmetric positions relative to the central bond. So, if you have mirror planes, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but if the substituents are such that each ring has a nitro and an ester, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. Wait, but the central atom is a single bond between the two rings. Wait, actually, in biphenyl structures, unless there's a substituent that creates asymmetry, the molecule can be meso or have other properties. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and carbonyl groups are in such positions that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Or maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. Oh, wait, if substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central axis, the molecule might be symmetric. So, for example, if one ring has a nitro at 6, the other also has it at 6, and same for the ester at 2. So the substituents are symmetrically placed. Then, the molecule might not have any chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the central carbon is a chiral center? Wait, but in biphenyl, the central bond is a single bond, and the two rings are connected by a single sigma bond. So each ring can rotate freely, but in the case where substituents are in positions that are mirror images, the molecule might not have a chiral center. So maybe this compound doesn't show optical isomerism. Or perhaps it does. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at the other compounds first and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is O

CH3-C-O-C-OCH3

OH

Wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3COO) connected to a CH(OH) group. Wait, more accurately, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH(OH)-something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the carboxylate of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOOC-CH2-OH? No, wait, the propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but as the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would mean the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. But as an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3 with an OH group on the middle carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH? Or is it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?

Wait, if that's the case, then the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3

CH2CH2-OH

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.
