Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the scenario is about an astronomer observing a star similar to the Sun. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes as the spots come into and out of view. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would cause a dip in brightness. The question is, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star?

Hmm. I think I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. So, the approach is probably to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then figure out what planet would cause the same change.

Wait, right. The star's light curve with spots would show a dip when the spots are on the visible side as the star rotates. The amount of dip depends on how much of the star is covered by spots and the temperature difference, I suppose. But I'm a bit confused about how the temperature affects the brightness contribution.

So, when a part of the star is cooler (like the spots), it emits less light. When that part is on the side facing us, the total light we receive decreases. The change in brightness is the difference between the star's normal emission and the spotted emission.

First, let's think about the star without spots. Its total luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, the spots are at a lower temperature, so their contribution is less. The filling factor (f) is 20%, so f = 0.2. The spots are on one hemisphere, so maybe that's not the entire surface, but let me think.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Oh wait, no, I think the filling factor f is the fraction of the entire star's surface that is covered by spots. Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered, so the total area covered is 0.5 * surface area. But the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So total area of spots is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) = 0.4πR². Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the entire hemisphere had spots, the filling factor would be 100%. Here, it's 20% of that hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Because a hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere.

But wait, the star's surface area is 4πR², so hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

Now, when the star rotates and the spotted hemisphere is visible, the spots contribute less. The brightness variation comes from the difference between the star's normal brightness and when the spots are visible.

The star's normal brightness is L_star = 4πR²σTeff^4.

The brightness when the spots are present (assuming the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us) is L_obs = (unspotted area * Teff^4 + spotted area * Tspot^4) * σ.

Wait, no. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.
