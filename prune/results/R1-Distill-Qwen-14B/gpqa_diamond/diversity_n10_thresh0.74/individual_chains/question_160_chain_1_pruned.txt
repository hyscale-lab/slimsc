Okay, so I have this physics problem about light diffraction. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length, 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large.

Wait, first, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same length, that means each side is equidistant from the center.

Hmm, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So this problem is essentially about a circular aperture when N is very large. Oh! Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon more closely resembles a circle.

I remember that the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy disk. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at specific angles. The first minimum (the first dark ring) is where the intensity drops to zero. The formula for the angular position of these minima is given by something like β = 1.22 * λ / (diameter of the aperture). Wait, no, wait. I think the formula is β = (m * π) / (a), where m is the order of the minimum. Or wait, maybe it's β = (m * λ)/(2a), but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, no, I think for the circular aperture, the minima occur when the path difference between light rays coming from the edges of the aperture is equal to (m + 1/2) λ, where m is an integer. So the condition for the minima is a * sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) λ, assuming small angles. Oh wait, but when the angle is small, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians.

So for the first minimum, m is 0, right? No, wait, for the first minimum after the central maximum, m is 1. Because m starts at 0 as the central maximum. So the first minimum would be m = 1. So the condition would be a * theta ≈ (1 + 1/2) λ, which is (3/2) λ? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula I remember is sin(theta) = (m * λ)/(d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. Or wait, perhaps it's the radius? No, wait, the formula for the minima in a single slit is a * sin(theta) = m λ, where a is the slit width. But this is a circular aperture, so the formula is a bit different.

In the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction minima are given by a * sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) * lambda, where m is 0, 1, 2, etc. So the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs when m=0, because for m=0, it's (0.5) lambda. So theta would be approximately (0.5 lambda)/(a), since for small angles, sin(theta) ≈ theta. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought the first minimum was at 1.22 lambda over the radius or diameter.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel function. The first zero (the first minimum) of the Bessel function J_1 occurs at approximately 1.22 lambda over the radius. Wait, no, wait. The formula is a * sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) * lambda, but wait, a is the radius or the diameter?

Wait, no, in the case of a circular aperture of radius 'a', the condition for the minima is a sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) * lambda, where m is 0,1,2,... So for the first minimum, m=0, giving a sin(theta) = (0.5) lambda, so theta ≈ 0.5 lambda / a. But wait, that's not matching what I remember. I thought the first minimum was around 1.22 lambda/(2a), because the radius would be a, so diameter is 2a. Oh! Maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, let's clarify. The formula for the m-th minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by a * sin(theta) = (m + 0.5) * lambda, where a is the radius of the aperture. So the first minimum (m=0) is at sin(theta) = (0.5 lambda)/a. But wait, when the aperture
