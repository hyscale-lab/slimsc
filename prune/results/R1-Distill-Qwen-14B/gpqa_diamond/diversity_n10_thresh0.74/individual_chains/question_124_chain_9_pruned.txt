Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, it's about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds and reaching the inner walls of a detector. Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, the question is about how far the particles can travel before decaying, I think.

So, the setup is that when particles are collided, they produce new particles that decay quickly. The problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor would make two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Wait, wait. I think I need to relate the distance the particles travel to their lifetime and the speed they're going. Since they're fast-decaying, their mean lifetime would be dilated due to time dilation in relativity. Oh right, time dilation! The proper lifetime (tau) is multiplied by gamma to get the dilated lifetime (t) in the lab frame.

So, the distance a particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by t, which is v multiplied by gamma tau. But how does that relate to the detector's radius? Oh, because only those particles that make it all the way to the inner walls (which are 30 meters away) will be detected. So, the condition is that the distance the particle travels (v gamma tau) must be greater than or equal to the detector's radius (30 m). Wait, but
