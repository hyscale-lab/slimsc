Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Interesting, because I remember that wave functions can have real and imaginary parts. But wait, when you square the absolute value, the probability density comes into play, right?

The key point is that when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, then maybe the given function is only valid within that region. Or perhaps the function is such that the probability is zero outside.

Wait, no, the wave function in the given part is where the particle can exist. So the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3. But wait, the question says each particle can be found between x=1 and x=3, and nowhere else. So the probability density must be zero outside this region.

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Oh, but wait, that's a complex wave function. For the probability density, we square the absolute value. So |ψ(x)|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)² ].

But wait, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because all the probability is there. Oh right, because the particles are found only between 1 and 3.

So the normalization condition is ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me write that out. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So the absolute square is |ψ|² = [ (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 ] + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the magnitude squared of a complex number, you square each part and sum.

Wait, no. If ψ = A + iB, then |ψ|² = A² + B². So in this case, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So |ψ|² is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so first integral becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] because when x=3, 1+x=4; x=1, 1+x=2
