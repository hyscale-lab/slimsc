Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving oct-4-ene in E and Z configurations. Both are treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then their products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. Since the starting alkenes are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, their epoxidation will depend on their stereochemistry.

Wait, so for each reaction: Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Both are treated with one equivalent, so I think it's a epoxidation reaction. Then aqueous acid is added.

Wait, what happens after epoxidation? Oh right, when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening. The acid probably protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and then water attacks the more substituted carbon in a ring-opening via acid catalysis. 

But wait, wait. Let's think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe I should draw the structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no: for oct-4-ene, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 carbons. So the double
