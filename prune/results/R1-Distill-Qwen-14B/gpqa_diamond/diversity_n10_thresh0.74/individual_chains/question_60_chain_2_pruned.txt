Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmmm, I remember from my classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So, the astronaut's own time would be shorter compared to the time observed from Earth. But wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective, so I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

The problem states that the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c! The distance they need to cover is to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, but how far is that? I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't give the distance, so maybe I'm supposed to figure it out with just the speed and the astronaut's lifetime.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 solar years. So, from Earth's frame, the astronaut would age 150 years, but from their own frame, their lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, wait. Actually, time dilation causes the moving clock (the astronaut's) to tick slower. So someone on Earth would see the astronaut aging slower, but the astronaut's own time would be their proper time.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event, which in this case is the astronaut's frame. So
