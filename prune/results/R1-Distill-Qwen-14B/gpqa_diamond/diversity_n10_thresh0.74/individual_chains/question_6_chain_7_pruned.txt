Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential, and I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, r is the radial distance, and θ is the angular coordinate in polar coordinates. So I think this potential depends both on r and θ, which complicates things a bit. Because in the case of central potentials (which depend only on r), the problem is separable into radial and angular parts, but here the θ dependence is present as well.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes potentials can still be separable even if they have angular terms. Let me think. The potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor that. Oh, I can factor out (1/2)kr², so that's (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, that's the same as (1/2)kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ), which is (1/2)kr² (something involving cosθ squared).

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as V(r) * some function of θ. But since it's a function of both variables, perhaps I should consider whether the potential can be expressed in a way that allows the Schrödinger equation to be separable. Because if it's separable, the solution would have a product of functions each depending on only r or only θ.

Wait, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is usually written in terms of r and θ. The equation includes terms in 1/r (d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/(r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²) + (2m/(ℏ²))(V(r,θ) - E)ψ = 0. So if V(r,θ) is not just a function of r, then the equation isn't as straightforward. But maybe the potential can be rewritten in a way that allows separation.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten as a sum of functions that depend only on r and only on θ. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr
