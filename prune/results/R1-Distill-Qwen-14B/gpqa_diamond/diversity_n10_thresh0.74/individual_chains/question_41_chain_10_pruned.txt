Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium from the perspective of a lab observer. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when a medium is moving, the speed of light within it might change according to some relativistic effects. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think step by step.

The setup is that there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is also towards the observer. The observer is in the lab frame. So, the glass is moving along with the light, but the light is going toward the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, maybe I should clarify the directions.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the beam is moving toward the observer, then the glass moving in the same direction as the beam would be moving toward the observer as well. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer, but the light is in the glass. Or is the light passing through the moving glass?

But the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. So, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, but that's when the medium is at rest. But here, the medium is moving. So I think I need to
