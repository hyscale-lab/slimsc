Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Let's break this down.

The products are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. Hmm, wait, I remember that when compounds undergo certain reactions, they can form diketones. The reagents mentioned here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh right, that's the nitrous acid (HONO) treatment, which is typically involved in the formation of carbocations or maybe some kind of elimination followed by rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: I think this is related to the Hock rearrangement. The Hock process involves the reaction of certain compounds with nitrous acid. Let me recall. Oh yes! The Hock rearrangement occurs when a geminal diol (a diol where both hydroxyls are on the same carbon) is treated with nitrous acid. The diol converts into a ketone or diketone.

So, the general process is: geminal diol → heated with HONO (like HCl, NaNO2) → forms a carbonyl group. The mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate where the two hydroxyl groups leave, creating a carbocation, which then rearranges or not, depending on the structure.

Wait, no, I think it's more like the diol reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt, but that might be for aromatic amines. Maybe for aliphatic compounds, it's a different pathway. Alternatively, I've heard that when a diol is treated with nitrous acid, it can form a ketone via the elimination of water, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So for each product, the starting material must have been a geminal diol.

Let me think about each product.

First product: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. So, two ketone groups on adjacent carbons (1 and 2) of a cyclohexane ring, and a substituent (isopropyl) on carbon 4.

Second product: 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. So, a hexane chain with methyl at position 5, and ketones at positions 2 and 3.

So, if the
