Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², right? And the force is like Hooke's law, so it's a harmonic oscillator scenario.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each giving different energy expressions and counts.

Wait, I need to figure out the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, maybe they are all the same or something. Oh wait, no, in 3D, the energy levels are given as E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), right? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2)ħω, and there are three directions.

Wait, so the total quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Or is it? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. Each direction (x, y, z) in the harmonic oscillator has its own set of quantum numbers. So the energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). So n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z determines the energy level. Each different combination of quantum numbers that adds up to the same n gives the same energy.

So the energy levels are quantized, and each level corresponds to a particular n. The ground state is when n=0 (n_x= n_y= n_z=0), first excited is n=1, etc. So the third excited state would be the state where n = 3? Or wait, wait, no. Because the ground state is the lowest, which is n=0 (all three quantum numbers are zero). The first excited state is n=1, the second is n=2, the third is n=3. So the third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, no, the counting starts at zero. Ground state is (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0,0,0), which is n=0. Then the first excited state could be any state where n=1, like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1). Similarly, the second excited state is n=2, which includes states like (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So the third excited state is when n=3. So for n=3, how many states are there? And what is the energy?

The energy for n=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Because E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no, because n is the sum of nx, ny, nz, which is 3. So E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's the first part.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are there for this energy eigenvalue? That is, how many distinct
