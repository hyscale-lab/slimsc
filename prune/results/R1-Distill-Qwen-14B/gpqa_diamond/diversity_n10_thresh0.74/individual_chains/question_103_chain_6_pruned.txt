Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. I need to figure out which reaction sequence will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the target molecule to understand what I need to do.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. At position 3, there's a bromine, and at 5, a nitro group. Then, attached to the benzene is an ethanone group (which is a ketone, so it's an acetyl group attached to the ring). The numbering must be such that the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, no, actually, the substituents are on the benzene ring. The ketone is attached directly to the benzene, right? So the structure is benzene with an acetyl group (CH3CO-) attached, a bromine at the meta position relative to the acetyl, and a nitro group at the para position relative to the acetyl or something like that. Wait, let me draw this.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the acetyl group (ethan-1-one is CH3CO- attached to the benzene), a bromine, and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group. So the acetyl is at position 1, then bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. That would make them meta and para positions relative to each other?

Wait no, benzene is a ring, so numbering should be the lowest possible. Let me think: if the acetyl is at position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are across from each other? Wait, maybe the substituents are arranged such that the acetyl is at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So those are the three substituents on the benzene ring.

So I need to plan the steps to introduce these substituents in the correct positions. I remember
