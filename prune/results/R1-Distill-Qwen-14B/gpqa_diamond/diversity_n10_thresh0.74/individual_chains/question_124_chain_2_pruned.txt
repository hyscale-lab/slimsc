Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead.

Alright, so I need to find the Lorentz factor that would result in two-thirds of the particles making it to the detector's walls. Let me think about what's going on here.

I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. At ultra-relativistic speeds, gamma is much larger than 1. So, in this case, gamma is initially about 20. But how does this relate to the particles reaching the detector walls?

Wait, the problem is about the particles decaying before they can reach the walls. So, the time it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the wall depends on their speed. If they decay, they won't reach the detector, so the fraction that does reach depends on their lifetime as observed in the lab frame.

Oh right, time dilation! Because from the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is longer by the gamma factor. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center, so the distance they need to travel to reach the detector's inner wall is the radius, which is 30 meters. So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. But since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So t ≈ R/c, where R is 30 meters.

But wait, the particle's lifetime as seen in the lab must be longer than t for it to reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before getting there.

So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the ratio of the lab lifetime to the time it takes to reach the wall. Because the probability is P = (gamma * tau) / t.

But wait
