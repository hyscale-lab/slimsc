Okay, so I've got this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I remember that m can be -1, 0, 1 for p orbitals, but maybe here it's considering small values like m=0 or something. Not sure if that's important yet.

The main task is to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think corresponds to the Balmer series in hydrogen. Wait, the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, but wait, this is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. That's the Balmer beta line, right? Or maybe that's the first Balmer line. Wait, the Balmer series starts at about 365 nm (H-alpha is 656, H-beta is 486... yes, so I think that's for the n=4 to n=2 transition, or wait, no, n=4 to n=2 would be H-beta? Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Oh well, perhaps it's the energy difference for a certain transition. The exact transition might not matter as much as the energy scale.

So for the paramagnetic term, I think the Hamiltonian is the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect is when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, and the energy levels split because of the interaction between the magnetic moment and the field.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Hamiltonian H_p = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m * something. Wait, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is μ = (e/(2m)) * L, but more accurately, the magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the Zeeman energy is E_Zeeman = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the dot product is just μ_z * B.

So H_p = μ_B * m * B. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. Wait, no, wait, it's eħ/(2m_e), which is about 9.27e-24 J/T. So for m=1 (if m is small, perhaps m is 0 or ±1), the energy would be μ_B * m * B.

So, with B=1 T, m=1, H_p would be about 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J. Wait, but what if m is 0? Then H_p would be zero. Wait, but the problem says m is small, so maybe m is 1 or -1 or 0. But perhaps for the purpose of this question, the magnitude is what's important, so we can take m=1.

Now, what about the transition energy ΔE? The wavelength λ is given as 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is about 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide that by λ = 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 ≈ 4.088e-18 J. Hmm, wait, let me check the calculation:

Wait 486.1e-9 is 4.861e-7 meters. So hc/λ: (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 m ≈ 4.088e-19 J. Wait, wait, 4.861e-7 m is 486.1e-9 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = let's compute:

1.9878e-25 divided by 4.861e-7 is approximately 4.088e-19 J. Because 4.861e-7 is 4.861 x 10^-7, so 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.9878 /4.861 is about 0.409, leading to 0.409e-18, which is 4.09e-19 J.

Wait, that seems really small. But wait, hydrogen's energy levels are on the order of 10^-18 J. Let me think: the ground state energy of hydrogen is about -13.6 eV. 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 13.6 eV is about 2.18e-18 J. So the transition energy ΔE for visible light (like Balmer series) would be on the order of 1e-19 J, which matches our earlier calculation of about 4e-19 J.

So the paramagnetic term is about 9e-24 J, and the transition energy is about 4e-19 J. So the ratio is 9e-24 /4e-19 ≈ 2.25e-5. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. The question says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE". The paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy, which for m=1 is about 9e-24 J, which is much smaller than the transition energy of 4e-19 J. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which is the Zeeman term) is much less than ΔE.

So the options are:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE. Probably not.

B) ⟨H⟩ much greater than ΔE. No, because 9e-24 is way smaller than 4e-19.

C) ⟨H⟩ much less than ΔE. Yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE. No.

So the correct option is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the Zeeman effect, where the energy is given by \( H_p = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B \).  
   - The Bohr magneton \( \mu_B \) is approximately \( 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \).  
   - The magnetic field \( B \) is \( 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m \) is small (e.g., \( m = 1 \)).  
   - Substituting these values, \( H_p = (9.27 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \).

2. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)**:  
   The wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) corresponds to the energy of a photon, calculated using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \).  
   - Planck's constant \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and the speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - Thus, \( \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term \( H_p \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \) is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). The ratio \( H_p / \Delta E \approx 2.25 \times 10^{-5} \), indicating that \( H_p \ll \Delta E \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the options, the correct choice is \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

Answer: C
