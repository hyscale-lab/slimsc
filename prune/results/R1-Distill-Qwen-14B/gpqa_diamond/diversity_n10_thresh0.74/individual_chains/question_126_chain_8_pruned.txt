Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Alright, the question involves two reactions, each starting with a different compound, and then combining the products. Then, they're run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram shows. The options are A to D with varying numbers.

So, first, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. The starting material is a ketoneâ€”3 hexanone with a methoxy group on carbon 5.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw this mentally. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a substituent on carbon 5. Carbon numbering: 1, 2,3 (keto), 4,5,6. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be:

Positions: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), then 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2?), 6 (CH3). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3? No, wait, 3-ketone in hexane would be:

Structure: CH2(CH2)4-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, hexane has six carbons. Hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=
