Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when using matrix exponential functions approximated by fractional approximations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I need to understand the context. Heat equations are partial differential equations (PDEs), and solving them numerically often involves methods like finite differences. Higher dimensions make it more complex, so using parallel algorithms can help speed things up. 

The question mentions that the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. Matrix exponentials are commonly used in solving systems of linear differential equations, which is relevant here because the heat equation can be discretized into such systems. 

Now, the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. Sequential algorithms process tasks one after another, while parallel algorithms handle them simultaneously. For splitting methods in solving PDEs, I remember something about domain decomposition or splitting the problem into smaller parts that can be solved in parallel.

The options given are A to D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is crucial in numerical methods to ensure that the errors don't grow uncontrollably. But stability analysis is more about whether the numerical method works correctly, not about making it parallel. So probably not the answer.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions are those where the boundary depends on values inside the domain, like in some heat transfer problems. I'm not sure how this directly relates to parallel splitting. Maybe it affects the way the problem is split, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Hmm, fractional approximations... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Fractional approximations are methods used to approximate matrix exponentials, like the Padé approximant. The roots of the approximating functions (like polynomials) might affect the stability or how the algorithm is split. If the roots are complex, maybe they influence the splitting into real and imaginary parts, allowing for parallel computation. Because complex numbers can be handled by multiple processors working on different parts simultaneously. That sounds plausible.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to break down rational functions into simpler terms. If the approximation can be split into a sum of simpler fractions, each could be computed in parallel. This might allow the algorithm to split the problem into parts that run concurrently. I'm a bit confused here because I thought partial fractions were more about simplifying expressions for computation, but maybe in the context of matrix operations, it allows for parallelism.

Wait, so the question is about the key factor in converting to a parallel algorithm. I remember that for matrix exponentials, especially in the context of time-splitting methods, you want to decompose the matrix into parts that can be exponentiated separately and in parallel. If the fractional approximation leads to a linear partial fraction, each term can be handled by a different processor, thus enabling parallel computation. Alternatively, if the approximation has complex roots, perhaps each complex part can be handled in a way that allows parallel processing.

Another angle: the process of parallel splitting in algorithms often involves decomposing the problem into independent subproblems. For matrix operations, this might involve diagonalizing the matrix or splitting it into commuting parts. Fractional approximations might involve such decompositions. If the approximation can be broken down into linear parts (like partial fractions), each part can be computed independently, allowing for parallelism.

So, considering options C and D. Option D is about linear partial fractions, which are a way to break down expressions. Option C is about the roots being complex. Linear partial fractions would allow splitting the matrix operation into multiple simpler operations that can be computed in parallel. So maybe D is the right answer.

Wait, but what's the context of the question? It says the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like using Padé approximants, often result in a rational function. To compute the exponential, especially for large matrices, it's helpful to express the exponential as a sum of simpler terms that can be computed in parallel. If the approximant can be expressed as a sum of terms (like partial fractions), each term can be evaluated separately on different processors.

So, if the approximation is a linear partial fraction, that directly supports splitting the computation into several parts, each handled in parallel. That would make option D the correct answer.

Alternatively, complex roots might relate to eigenvalues, but I'm not sure how that directly leads to parallelism. Maybe the presence of complex roots affects the stability or the form of the approximation, but the key factor for parallelism is more about being able to split the problem.

So, putting it all together, the key factor is
