Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can do.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. Hmm, so I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So maybe the positions matter.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Br are across the structure. Heating with KOH in excess. Oh, perhaps an E2 elimination? But elimination usually requires adjacent leaving groups. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but since the Br's are not adjacent, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, another thought: KOH can also act as a base and cause elimination. But if the molecule isn't set up for a simple E2, maybe it's a different pathway. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but with two Br groups, maybe a double substitution?

Wait, the product formed is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an epoxide. Because epoxides are usually light-colored, maybe even yellowish. And the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around the range for an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, but an epoxide's C-O-C stretch is around 1200-1250 cm⁻¹, but maybe a carbonyl group. Hmm, but wait, the product after KOH heating would more likely be an epoxide because adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide, perhaps KOH is causing elimination to form an alkene, but the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation (if vicinal, which they are not here). Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait! Maybe the KOH is causing a neighboring group elimination. Wait, but that requires some kind of leaving group and a neighboring group that can stabilize a charge. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead, which are typically not good for elimination because of the structure. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structures. Adamantane has a structure like a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions would be on opposite ends, perhaps on adjacent bridgeheads. So, when you have two bromines on 1 and 3 positions, perhaps KOH can deprotonate and cause some sort of elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the formation of an epoxide via a base-catalyzed reaction. Wait, but for epoxide formation, you typically have a vicinal dihalide reacting with a base, but here it's a 1,3-dihalide. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when two bromides are on a rigid structure like adamantane, perhaps heating with a strong base like KOH would cause a double elimination, but I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe each Br undergoes elimination, but since they're on opposite sides, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So maybe the product after KOH is a ketone or an ester. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh! Wait a minute. Maybe it's a dihalide elimination to form a diketone. Or perhaps a single elimination forms a ketone. Let me think: if one Br leaves, but that requires a good leaving group and a proton adjacent. Oh wait, but the structure of adamantane might not allow for that. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a different arrangement. Wait, no—the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the positions are 1 and 3,
