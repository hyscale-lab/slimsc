Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says: We need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given by specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm. So, the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the angle θ will be from the z-axis, but the direction is arbitrary, so maybe the eigenvector is along that direction.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the angular momentum operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states along that axis. Since the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, this must be the spin-up state along n.

So, the eigenvector we're looking for is the spin-up state along direction n. The spin-½ particles have eigenvectors that can be expressed in terms of the spherical basis for spin, or in terms of the direction.

In general, for a spin-½ particle, the spin-up state along direction (θ, φ) is given by:

|+> = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ - e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩

Wait, no, wait. The standard expression is usually written in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, maybe it's written in terms of the angle θ from the z-axis and azimuthal angle φ.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvectors for spin along a direction n (θ, φ) can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of Sz.

The general form is something like:

|+> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T

Wait, no, I think I might have the signs wrong. Because the spin-up state along n is a combination of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. Let me recall: the eigenstates of S·n are (|↑⟩_n and |↓⟩_n), which are superpositions of the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ along z.

The rotation from the z-axis to the n direction can be achieved with a rotation matrix. For spin-½, the rotation is represented by a unitary matrix. So, the spin-up state along n is given by:

|+> = e^{iφ/2} [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact form. Another approach is to construct the operator P·n and find its eigenvectors.

Wait, the operator P is given for x, y, z components. So, the operator in the direction n (which lies in x-z plane) would be P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since n is in x-z (so n_y = 0). Wait, no,
