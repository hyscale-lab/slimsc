Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is a reaction that reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting material must have a ketone group, and the product would be an alkane.

Now, looking at the data provided for Compound X: there's IR and NMR data. I'll need to analyze that to figure out the structure of X before the reaction.

Let me start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the product is an alkane, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which specifically targets ketones. So that tells me X has a ketone group.

Looking at the IR, there's a strong peak around 1720 cm-1. I recall that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters) show up around there. So a ketone would have a peak around 1700-1750 cm-1. So that fits. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be from aromatic rings, perhaps the C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring attached to a ketone.

Now the NMR data. Let's break it down.

The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3400 for that. Wait, the IR 3400-2500 could be an O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid? But wait, then the Clemmensen reaction wouldn't make sense because carboxylic acids don't have ketones. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, another possibility: if it's an acetylenic proton, but those are usually around 1-3 ppm, so that doesn't fit. Or an aldehyde. Wait, but if it's a ketone, why is there a peak at 10.5? Oh, unless it's an enol tautomer? Or maybe it's something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. But wait, in that case, the IR at 3400-2500 might be an aldehyde's stretching? Wait, aldehydes have a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but the IR here doesn't mention those. Wait, the IR data given includes 3400–2500 cm-1 as a broad range. That could be O-H stretch, but if it's an aldehyde, then perhaps the
