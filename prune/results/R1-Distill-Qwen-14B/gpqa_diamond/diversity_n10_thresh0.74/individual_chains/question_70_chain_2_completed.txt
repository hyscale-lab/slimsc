Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me break down the information given step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let's outline each reaction and see what we can deduce.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio. I'm thinking maybe a reaction where solid A is something like a metal, and gas B is a halogen or something similar. Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Like, for example, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, FeCl3 would require 3 Cl2 per Fe, but 8 is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming a compound with multiple atoms attached.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like AgBr? No, wait, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Another thought: I recall that when metals like iron react with Cl2, they form FeCl3, which is a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming something like PbO2, which is dark brown, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate? Or perhaps it's a reaction forming a compound that's red in color. Oh, I remember that lead(II,IV) oxide is dark brown, but maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and sulfur. Like FeS is black, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal oxide. Wait, I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the next part.

2. Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. What kind of gases could D be? Let me think about possible reactions. If C is a metal sulfide, reacting with D (maybe H2O? No, because D is a gas. Or maybe D is a halogen? Or perhaps D is something like Cl2 again? But then E could be a different compound. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas. Wait, what's a highly hazardous product when you react a metal compound with gas?

Wait, if C is a sulfide, then D could be something like H2O, but D is a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, and D is H2O. But that would form NH3 and something else, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe C is a chloride, and D is O2? Not sure. Let me set this aside for a moment and look at the next clue.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it produces A, F, and G. So, C is likely a compound that, upon hydrolysis, decomposes into A, F, and G.

Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include H3PO4, H2S, etc. So the decomposition of C gives two different acids: one strong and one weak.

What compounds, upon hydrolysis, produce two different acids? Hmm. Maybe a salt of a strong acid and weak base? Or perhaps a more complex scenario.

Wait, suppose C is a sulfite or something, but then I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's think: if A is a metal, say, Mg, and C is Mg3N2, then hydrolysis would produce Mg(OH)2 (which is a base, but maybe forms MgO and water?), but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal sulfate. For example, suppose A is Al, and C is Al2(SO4)3. Then hydrolysis with water would produce Al(OH)3 and H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but Al(OH)3 would react with more water to form Al(OH)3·nH2O, but that's not an acid. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Let's think: If A is Fe and C is Fe(NO3)3, then hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)3 (which is a weak base), but I don't see two acids here.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of a metal carbonate. If C is, say, CaCO3, then hydrolysis would produce Ca(OH)2 and CO2. But CO2 is an acid (weak), and Ca(OH)2 is a base. Hmm, but that's only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide? Let's think: if C is FeS, then hydrolysis in water would produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. Fe(OH)2 is a base, and H2S is a weak acid. So F could be H2S (weak acid), but what about A? Wait, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So A would be Fe(OH)2. But that's not a solid, it's a hydroxide. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps C is something like Pb3O4. When Pb3O4 is hydrolyzed, it can form PbO, Pb(OH)2, and water. But I'm not sure if that leads to two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite. For example, if C is CaSO3, then hydrolysis might produce CaSO4 (which isn't an acid) and SO2 gas. But SO2 is a weak acid when dissolved in water. Hmm, but again, not two acids.

Wait another thought: maybe C is a metal nitrite. If C is, say, Cu(NO2)2, then hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 and HNO2. But HNO2 is a weak acid. So F would be HNO2, and perhaps A is Cu(OH)2. But again, not seeing two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, if C is CaC2, then hydrolysis gives Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (acetylene), but C2H2 is a weak acid? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is FeO. Then, hydrolysis in water would form Fe(OH)2 and O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is Fe3O4, which can hydrolyze to Fe(OH)3 and something else.

Wait, maybe the metal is aluminum. Aluminum-based compounds: if C is Al2O3, then hydrolysis (in water) would just give Al(OH)3. That doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, another approach. The decomposition of C gives A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a salt that can be broken down into a metal (A), a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). Alternatively, maybe C is a mixture of ions that, upon hydrolysis, form these substances.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed salt, like a nitro sulfate or something. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, C could be a complex salt.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. For example, suppose A is Fe, and C is FeCl3. Then, hydrolysis would produce Fe(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid (F), and Fe(OH)3 could decompose further? Or perhaps the reaction is more like FeCl3 + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl. So F would be HCl, G... wait, but what's the other product? Wait, in that case, only HCl is produced as an acid, and Fe(OH)3 as a base. So that doesn't give two acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is something like CaCl2·2H2O. But upon heating, it loses water and forms anhydrous CaCl2, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps C is a hydrate that decomposes upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and another acid. Let me think: For example, (NH4)NO3 on heating decomposes into NH3, NO2, and H2O. But that's when heated. When reacted with water, maybe it just stays as the same ions.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's think: If C is CuS, then hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 and H2S. So H2S is a weak acid (G). Then, what's F? If A is Cu(OH)2, which is a base, then maybe I'm not on the right track.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think about the other part of the problem.

4. When C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Wait, D reacts with B to form H, a solvent. So B is a gas, D is a gas, and H is a solvent. Let me think about possible gases B and D. Solvents made from reactions between gases could be things like H2O, NH3, HCl, etc.

Wait, gas B is involved in the first reaction with A. So A is a solid, B is a gas, and they form C. Let me think about possible reactions. Perhaps A is a metal reacting with a halogen (like Cl2 or Br2) to form a metal halide. For example, Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. So B would be Cl2.

Then, D is another gas. D reacts with B (Cl2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So, what reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. H could be HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, NH3? Wait, if D is NH3 and B is Cl2, then Cl2 + NH3 can react to form NH2Cl and other products, but that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O, but D is a gas. Wait, H2O is a liquid at room temperature but can be a gas when hot. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: D is H2. If B is Cl2, then H2 and Cl2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl (gas). But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2, but O2 plus Cl2 doesn't react at room temperature. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe D is O3 (ozone), but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But H is formed from B and D. So if B is Cl2, then D must be something that reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent. For example, if D is H2O, then Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But HOCl is a bleaching agent, but not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is HCl, but that's a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2. Then D could be H2. O2 and H2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So B is O2, D is H2. Then H is H2O.

Wait, but then in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So, A is perhaps a metal that reacts with O2 in high amounts. For example, lead (Pb) forms PbO2 when reacted with O2 in a certain ratio. Let's see: Pb + O2 → PbO2. But the stoichiometry? For example, 4Pb + 5O2 → 2Pb2O5. Wait, but in the problem, A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (O2). So the ratio is 1:8. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are used. That suggests a high oxidation state for A.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. For example, if A is Fe, then Fe + O2 on reaction could form Fe3O4. The reaction is 3Fe + 2O2 → Fe3O4. So the ratio is 3:2, which is 0.666 O2 per Fe. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents, which is 8 O2 per A. So for one mole of A, 8 moles of O2. So the formula would be A O8? That's possible only for certain elements. For example, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product C is PbO2. Let me see. The reaction for PbO2 is when Pb reacts with O2 in a 4:5 ratio. Wait, Pb + O2 → PbO2. The balanced equation is 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check: Pb has a valency of +4 typically. So PbO2 would be Pb^4+ and O^2- each. The formula is PbO2.

The formation reaction would be 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO2. So for 2 moles of Pb, 1 mole of O2 is needed. So the ratio is 1:0.5, meaning per mole of Pb, 0.5 O2. But in the problem, the ratio is 8 equivalents. So 8 O2 per A. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a diatomic solid? No, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's not a metal but another type of solid. Maybe a compound that reacts with O2 to form a complex oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps B is not O2. Let's reconsider. If B is Cl2, then D could be something else.

Wait, earlier thought: B is Cl2, D is H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So that might not fit.

Wait another angle: what if H is NH3, a common solvent. Then, D must react with Cl2 (if B is Cl2) to form NH3. But that's not possible because Cl2 and NH3 react to produce NH2Cl and HCl, but I don't think that's a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is N2, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2. Then D could be H2O. CO2 + H2O → H2CO3, which is not a solvent. Or perhaps D is something else.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, perhaps it's a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's produced when a cyanide reacts with acid. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question. Alternatively, E could be something like phosgene, but again, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like H2S. No, H2S is toxic but maybe not the most extreme. Alternatively, maybe E is a metal cyanide, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a gas like SO2 or NO2. Both are toxic. Let me think about how C and D could produce such gases.

Alternatively, if E is HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in the way that, say, sarin is.

Wait, maybe E is a hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but that would require specific reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to find out what C is first. Because once I know C, I can figure out what E is.

So, back to the hydrolysis reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids (one strong, one weak) and A.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a sulfite ester? For example, maybe it's something like Na2SO3, but that would hydrolyze to NaOH and H2SO3 (which is H2S O3, a weak acid). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, what if C is a nitrate and a sulfate? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible acids. F is a strong acid, so possibilities include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. G is a weak acid, like H2S, H3PO4, acetic acid, etc.

So, if C hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid and a weak acid, perhaps C is a compound that contains both types of ions. For example, perhaps it's a salt of a strong acid and a weak base, but that might not directly form two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal dichloride that upon hydrolysis produces HCl and another acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a mixed salt, like ammonium nitrate. But when ammonium nitrate is hydrolyzed, it produces NH4OH (a weak base) and HNO3 (a strong acid). But that's only one acid, so not matching.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal carbonate. Like CaCO3. Hydrolysis would produce CO2 (a weak acid) and a base like Ca(OH)2. But again, only one acid.

Hmm. Another angle: maybe C is a metal superoxide. For example, KO2. When KO2 reacts with water, it produces O2 and KOH. But that's just one acid (if any), since KOH is a base.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. When Na2O2 reacts with water, it produces NaOH and O2. Again, no acids here.

Hmm, this is challenging. Let me think about the possible reactions again.

The first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid). I'm thinking the bright red color is a big clue. What compounds are bright red?

Wait, I remember that mercury(II) nitrate is a red solid, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's lead(IV) oxide (PbO2), but that's dark brown. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a compound of chromium. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but perhaps another chromium compound is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. MnO2 is black, but Mn2O7 is dark green.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For example, FeS is black, but perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is between a metal and sulfur vapor. For example, when iron reacts with sulfur vapor, it forms FeS, which is black, but perhaps in some cases, other sulfides are red. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a metal hexafluoride. For example, FeF6 is not a thing, perhaps, but other metals have hexafluorides. Wait, some metal hexafluorides are colorless or pale, not bright red.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving iodine. For example, when potassium reacts with iodine, it forms KI, which is a white solid. But that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a nitro compound, like nitrobenzene, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a metal oxide with a high oxidation state. For example, lead(IV) oxide is dark brown, but maybe vanadium(V) oxide is orange. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal sulfide. For example, CuS is black, but maybe another metal's sulfide is red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mixed oxide.

Wait, another approach: perhaps solid A is a metal, and gas B is a halogen. So, for example, A is Fe, B is Cl2, then C is FeCl3. FeCl3 is a yellowish-brown solid, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is Cu, and B is Cl2. Then, CuCl2 is blue. Not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a metal oxide with a high oxidation state. For example, MnO3 is dark green. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a sulfonic acid? I don't think so, as those are typically liquids.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal phosphide. For example, Fe3P is black, but perhaps another phosphide is red.

Wait, perhaps C is a complex compound. For example, some nickel or cobalt complexes are red. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on this. Let me think about the possible E and its symmetry group.

Looking at the options:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry point groups. So E's structure must belong to one of these.

If E is something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But phosgene isn't extremely hazardous in the way the question describes, but perhaps it's another linear molecule.

Wait, sarin gas is a chiral molecule, which would have a lower symmetry, perhaps C2. But I'm not sure about its structure.

Alternatively, let's think about E's possible structure. If E is a linear molecule with a center of symmetry, it would have D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 is linear with D∞h. But CO2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. But HCN is a liquid at room temperature, I think. Or maybe it's a gas under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a symmetric molecule with a C2 axis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry. Ozone has a bent structure with a C2v point group.

Wait, O3 is a bent molecule, with a central O double-bonded to two other O's. Its symmetry group is D3h, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's C2v.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure of E. Let me think about possible candidates.

If E is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. If it's a bent molecule, maybe C2v or D3h. If it's a planar molecule with a C2 axis, maybe C2.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to go back and see if I can find out what C is.

So, C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that contains both a nitrate (strong acid anion) and a sulfite (weak acid anion). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe C is a mixed carbonate and another salt. For example, CaCO3·something. No, but upon hydrolysis, it would give CO3^2- which hydrolyzes to CO2 and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate and sulfate mixed. For example, if C is a hydrate that decomposes into a metal hydroxide, HNO3, and H2SO4. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps C is a complex salt. For example, if C is Cu(NO3)2·xH2O, then hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2, HNO3, and water. But that would give only one acid, HNO3. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a metal sulfide that upon hydrolysis produces H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But that doesn't give a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitroprusside or something similar, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt like NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 is heated, it decomposes into Na2SO4, H2SO4, and possibly H2O. So if C were NaHSO4, then hydrolysis would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and Na2SO4, but where's the second acid? Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal acetate. When hydrolyzed, it would produce a metal hydroxide and acetic acid (weak acid). But that's only one acid.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal oxalate. When oxalate salts hydrolyze, they can produce oxalic acid (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, only one acid.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about what the possible E is, and then see what symmetry it has.

If E is something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But phosgene is quite hazardous, though perhaps not the most extreme.

Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but Cl2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, but Cl2 is a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion, so its point group is D∞h.

Wait, but earlier in the problem, B is gas B. If B is Cl2, then D is another gas. So when C reacts with D, which reacts with Cl2, to form E.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCl gas. But HCl is a strong acid and not extremely hazardous in that form, though it's dangerous in high concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a sarin-like nerve agent. Sarin is an organophosphorus compound with a structure that has a certain symmetry. For example, sarin has a central phosphorus atom with four substituents, which would give it a certain symmetry. But I'm not certain about its point group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), but that's not extremely hazardous.

Wait, another thought: if E is a molecule like CH3CH2NH2 (ammonia gas?), but that's not likely.

Alternatively, maybe E is a symmetric molecule like O=C=O (CO2), which is linear with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I thought that E is a product of C and D, which reacts with B (Cl2) to form H, a solvent.

Wait, perhaps D is H2O, and B is Cl2, so H is HCl (a gas, not a solvent). That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, if B is O2, D is H2, then H is H2O, which is a solvent. That fits. So, in that case, B is O2, D is H2, and H is H2O.

So, then C is a product of A and O2 in an 8:1 ratio. So, A is a solid that reacts with O2 to form C. What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio? Maybe a metal with a high oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a trioxide. For example, consider the reaction of a metal with O2 to form M2O3. Let's see: 2M + 3O2 → 2M2O3. So, the ratio of O2 to M is 3/2 per M. For 8 equivalents, that's 8 O2 per M. So perhaps the formula is M O8. Wait, that's not possible for most metals. Alternatively, maybe the formula is MO4, but that would require more O2.

Wait, perhaps the metal is lead. Let's think: Pb reacts with O2 to form PbO2. The reaction is 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO2. So, for 2 Pb, 1 O2. Which is a 1:0.5 ratio. But in the problem, the ratio is 8 O2 per A. So perhaps A is Pb, and the formula is PbO8, but that's not a common compound.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is 4 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 Pb2O5. The ratio is 5 O2 per 4 Pb → 5/4 O2 per Pb. So 1.25 O2 per Pb. Not 8.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's say the formula of C is MO8, which would mean M has a +4 oxidation state (since O is -2). So MO8 would have M^4+ and O^2- → overall charge is balanced. But finding a metal with a +4 oxidation state that forms such a compound is challenging. Maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, perhaps the product is a metal peroxide, like MO2. For example, FeO2 is not a common compound, but let's imagine it. The reaction would be Fe + O2 → FeO2. The ratio would be 1 O2 per Fe. So for 8 equivalents, the formula would need to have 8 O2 per Fe. Hmm, but that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal ozonide, but that's speculative.

I think I'm stuck on identifying C. Maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the possible symmetry groups.

If E is a linear molecule, its point group is likely D∞h. So option C is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule with a C2 axis, perhaps it's O3, which has a C2v symmetry. So option D.

Wait, but O3 is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. Its structure is O-O-O, but not really. Wait, no, O3 is O with a central O atom connected to two O atoms, with a bent structure. The molecule has a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, making its point group C2v.

So if E is O3, the symmetry group would be C2v (option D). But is O3 extremely hazardous? I think O3 is toxic but not as extremely hazardous as some other compounds.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=C=O), which is a linear molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry (option B). Phosgene is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if it's the product here.

Alternatively, maybe E is HCN, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. But HCN is a liquid at room temperature. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a symmetric molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. CO2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous, but maybe in high concentrations it can be.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the possible E given the reactions.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. If D is H2, and C is a metal oxide, perhaps E is water? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let me try to sum up what I know:

- A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
- C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
- D + B → H (solvent)
- C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Assuming that B is Cl2, D could be H2, but then H would be HCl, which isn't a solvent. Alternatively, B is O2, D is H2, H is H2O.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then:

- A reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form C.
- C is a bright red solid.
- C reacts with H2 in 2 equivalents to form E (extremely hazardous), perhaps something like H2O? No.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal (A) and water. But that would be a reduction reaction. So, for example, CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that doesn't form E; it's a product.

Hmm. Maybe E is a byproduct of this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxide that upon reaction with H2 produces a less oxidized form and water, but that doesn't explain E being extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a metal hydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form a metal and water, but that's a typical reduction reaction. But the problem says C reacts with D to form E, so E would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Let's say A is Fe, B is Cl2, so C is FeCl3. Then, C reacts with D (maybe H2O) to form E. FeCl3 + H2O → Fe(OH)3 + HCl. But HCl is a strong acid, which is F in the hydrolysis reaction. So E would be Fe(OH)3, which is not extremely hazardous. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with H2 might not do much, but perhaps in the presence of a catalyst, it decomposes into CO2 and CaO. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a gas produced when C reacts with D. For example, if C is Fe3O4 and D is CO, then Fe3O4 + CO → Fe metal + CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a toxic gas like HCN, but how would that form?

Wait, going back to the hydrolysis reaction: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid), then C could be a chloride and sulfide salt, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: C is a complex salt containing both nitrate and sulfate ions. For example, perhaps a hydrate that, upon decomposition, produces HNO3 and H2SO4. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate with a sulfate group. For instance, perhaps it's a mixed salt that upon hydrolysis releases both acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of possible E molecules and their symmetry.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a linear molecule. So, possible E could be O=C=O (phosgene), HCN, etc. Alternatively, if E has C2v symmetry, it's a bent molecule, like O3.

But in the problem, E is extremely hazardous. Phosgene is toxic, O3 is irritating but not extremely hazardous. Sarin gas has a certain structure; perhaps it's a more complex molecule with lower symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like Cl2O7 (dichlorodifluoride?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps E is something like ClF3, but that's a trigonal pyramidal molecule with C3v symmetry, not matching any options.

Alternatively, if E is a symmetric molecule like I2 (diatomic), which has D∞h symmetry, but I2 isn't extremely hazardous in that form.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is D∞h (option B), as E is a linear molecule like phosgene or CO2. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, if E is a symmetric molecule like HCN, which is linear, then it would have D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but HCN is a liquid at room temperature. So perhaps E is a gas, which would be consistent with D being a gas.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is a gas with a linear structure. So, I'll go with D∞h as the symmetry group.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometric ratio of 8 equivalents suggests a high oxidation state for A. The bright red color of C hints at a compound with a specific electronic structure, possibly a transition metal oxide or a halide.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. This reaction suggests a transformation involving gas D, which interacts with C to form E. The extreme hazard of E indicates it is likely a toxic gas or a highly reactive compound.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, along with two acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). This hydrolysis reaction implies that C contains functional groups that yield both types of acids, such as halides and sulfides or nitrates and sulfites.

4. **Reaction 4**: Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B combine to form a common solvent, likely water (H₂O), if B is oxygen (O₂) and D is hydrogen (H₂).

### Key Deductions:
- **Gas B is likely O₂**: This aligns with the reaction of A (a solid) and O₂ to form C, a bright red solid. For example, lead(IV) oxide (PbO₂) or other high oxidation state metal oxides could fit this description.
- **Gas D is likely H₂**: D reacts with O₂ to form H₂O, a common solvent.
- **Product C is likely a high oxidation state metal oxide**: This oxide reacts with H₂O to produce A (a metal hydroxide), a strong acid (e.g., HCl), and a weak acid (e.g., H₂S).

### Symmetry Group of E:
- E is produced when C reacts with D (H₂). If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would be **D∞h**. Examples of such molecules include phosgene (O=C=O) or HCN, which are linear and highly toxic.
- If E is a bent molecule, its symmetry group would be **C2v**, as seen in ozone (O₃). However, ozone is not as extremely hazardous as implied in the problem.
- Given the options and the context of E being extremely hazardous, a linear molecule with **D∞h** symmetry is the most plausible.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
