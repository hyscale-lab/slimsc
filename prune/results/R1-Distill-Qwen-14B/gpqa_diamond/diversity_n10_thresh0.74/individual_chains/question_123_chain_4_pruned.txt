Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to parse through this step by step. 

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So the key here is probably dealing with relative velocities and time dilation, right? Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time might not pass the same in both frames.

Wait, no. Wait, in special relativity, when two objects are moving relative to each other, each sees the other's time as dilated. So if I have two frames, S (Galaxy) and S' (ejecta), moving relative to each other at velocity v.

But wait, wait. Let me get the setup right. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S' (ejecta frame), the Galaxy is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v = 60,000 km/s. Because velocities are relative, so if frame S' sees S moving at v, then S sees S' moving at v (assuming non-accelerating, inertial frames).

Wait, no. Wait, Newtonian physics says that velocities are relative, but in relativity, it's a bit more nuanced with velocity transformation. Oh, right, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame (S) would be u = -v, since if from S' the Galaxy is moving at +v, then from S, the ejecta is moving at -v. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the signs wrong. Let me think.

In the problem, the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is towards the center. Let's say in the Galaxy frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v (positive direction towards the center). So from the ejecta's frame (S
