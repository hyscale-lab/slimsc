Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me think through what each piece of data means. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work this out step by step.

The question gives information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A, B, C, D respectively.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak—could that be an -OH group? Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 is a bit lower than 1700, so maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide.

Wait, if there's a carbonyl at 1700 and another peak lower, maybe something like an ester or a ketone with conjugation. Oh, wait, esters have two carbonyl regions? No, esters usually have a C=O around 1740 or so for aliphatic esters. Hmm, but maybe if it's conjugated or something, the peak could be lower. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. Or perhaps the 1700 is an ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretch. Because aromatic rings have strong absorption around 1600, maybe. So maybe the compound has both an ester group and an aromatic ring?

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The IR shows O-H (broad), a carbonyl (1700), and another peak at 1650. Let's think about possible functional groups
