Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. 

First, looking at the FTIR data: it shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group somewhere. Esters are usually derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols, so the structure might have an ester linkage, like R-O-CO-O-R' or something. Wait, no, esters are RCOOR', right? So one part is the acyl group (RCO-) and the other is the alkoxy group (OR').

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum is where I'll get more structural information. The spectrum shows six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that make the ring have two different types of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, there would be two sets of aromatic protons: the ones adjacent to the substituents and the ones opposite. Or maybe the substituents are ortho or meta? Wait, di-substituted rings have different substitution patterns. Para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent Hs. Ortho substitution would lead to maybe three sets if the substituents are in the 1,2 positions, but maybe not. Hmm, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H, so perhaps it's para substitution.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an alkene or possibly an aromatic ring with substituents that have adjacent double bonds. Wait, but the ring is aromatic, which is already conjugated. So maybe the substituents have their own double bonds. For example, maybe one substituent is
