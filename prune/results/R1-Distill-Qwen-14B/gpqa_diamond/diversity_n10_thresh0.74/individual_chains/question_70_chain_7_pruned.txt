Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions, and I'm supposed to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are point groups from molecular symmetry. Point groups help classify molecules based on their symmetry.

Let me go through each reaction and see what the compounds might be. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen or something that combines in an 8:1 ratio. Wait, bright red product C... That makes me think of something like sulfur maybe? Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Wait, another possibility is a reaction involving lead dioxide? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is copper, and B is sulfur? But 8 equivalents seems high. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Sodium and chlorine react in a 1:1 ratio, but that's not 8. Hmm, maybe A is an oxide and B is something else.

Wait, the product C is used in another reaction. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm. Extremely hazardous products—maybe something like a nerve gas or a highly toxic compound. Alternatively, maybe something like phosgene or something else.

Also, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it undergoes hydrolysis. So C is probably an anhydride, perhaps a sulfide or something similar. Wait, when an anhydride reacts with water, it usually forms two acids. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, maybe one is a sulfuric acid (strong) and the other is something like acetic acid (weak). Or maybe sulfuric and another acid.

Wait, but let's think about the initial
