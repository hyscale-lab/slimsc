Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, let's recall what red phosphorus and HI do in a reaction. I remember that red phosphorus is commonly used in the hydroxylation or possibly in the elimination of certain groups. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a compound with a benzyl group or some kind of allylic structure, red phosphorus and HI can lead to a substitution reaction, specifically a hydrolysis of an adjacent group, maybe like the hydrolysis of a benzyl halide to a phenol. Alternatively, if the compound is a tosylate or something similar, it might undergo elimination or substitution. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of chlorides or other halides adjacent to carbonyl groups. Wait, no, maybe that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat for reducing ketones to alkanes. But that's not this case here. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI can cause the elimination of a halide, perhaps in a substitution reaction, maybe a benzylic position. Or wait, another possibility: if the compound has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and a leaving group nearby, the red phosphorus might help in the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzyl chloride, which upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus would form a benzyl amine? No, wait, red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of benzyl halides to form benzyl alcohols. Oh right! I think that's the case. So, if Compound X is a benzyl halide, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze it to a benzyl alcohol. 

Wait, but the reaction is more specific. Let me think: when we have a benzyl halide (like benzyl chloride), and we treat it with phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrolysis reaction that converts the benzyl chloride to benzyl alcohol. So, the leaving group (Cl-) is replaced by an -OH group. So, the product would be a phenol or a substituted benzyl alcohol. 

Now, looking at the IR and NMR data of Compound X to figure out its structure. Let's start with the IR. The IR shows peaks at 3400-2500, which is a broad region typically indicative of O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or phenol) or maybe an amine. But another strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting this together, the compound likely has a carbonyl group (maybe a ketone) and an aromatic ring. Plus, perhaps an alcohol group, given the broad peak in IR.

Looking at the NMR data:
