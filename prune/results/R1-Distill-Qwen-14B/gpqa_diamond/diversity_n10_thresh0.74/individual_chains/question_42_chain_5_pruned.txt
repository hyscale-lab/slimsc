Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what it's all about. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The main data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of about 1.4. So Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by that factor. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2 by that ratio. But wait, equilibrium temperature—oh right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect black body, right? It depends on the distance from its star and its albedo.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because a higher albedo means the planet reflects more light and is cooler. But since they all have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking ratios, I think. So maybe I don't need to worry about that here.

Next, the mass ratios. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet1. Then Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet3 is more massive than Planet2. So the masses are in the order Planet1 < Planet2 < Planet3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So I need to find Period3 / Period1.

I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. But wait, Kepler's law is usually stated as P² ∝ a³/(M_star), but in this question, the planets are orbiting the same star, right? Because they're a system. So the star's mass is the same for all three. So Kepler's law for each planet would be P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³. So the period squared is proportional to a cubed.

But wait, I
