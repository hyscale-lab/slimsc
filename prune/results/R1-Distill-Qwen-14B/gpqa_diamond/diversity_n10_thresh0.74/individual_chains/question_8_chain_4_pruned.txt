Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup: They did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). They know that at least one of these is a transcription factor that's upstream of others. 

The question is about interpreting the results of testing these mutants for resistance. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control. The control (wild-type) is 100%. So any mutant with lower resistance means they're more susceptible.

Let me look at the data:

- g1: 75% → less than wild-type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So knocking out G2 makes them very sick.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance. So bad, but not as bad as g2.
- g1g3: 10% → really bad. Worse than either individual.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. 

Hmm. The key here is to figure out the genetic relationships between these genes. The question is about which conclusion is correct regarding their interactions.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with statements about which gene is a transcription factor, whether others show pleiotropy or gene redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

So, what do I know? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If a mutation in gene A masks the phenotype of gene B, then A is epistatic to B, or vice versa. Alternatively, if the double mutant (A and B both knocked out) has the same phenotype as one of them, that suggests that one is downstream of the other.

So, let's think about each mutant:

G2 knockout has 0% resistance. That's the worst. So G2 seems really important. When G2 is knocked out, even in the double mutants where another gene is also knocked out, like g1g2, or g2g3, the resistance is still 0%. So, knocking out G2 is lethal in terms of resistance. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor upstream, and without it, the plant can't activate any defense.

Looking at G1: the single mutant is 75% resistance. So it's still somewhat resistant. But when G1 is combined with G2 knockout, the resistance is 0%. So G2 being knocked out is masking whatever effect G1 has. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Or maybe G2 is in a different pathway.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is necessary for any resistance. If G1's effect is only when G2 is present, that would suggest G2 is upstream.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So, the presence of the g1 mutation doesn't change the resistance when G2 is already knocked out. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1, or G1 is downstream of G2.

In the case where G2 is upstream, knocking out G2 would mean that whatever G1 does can't happen because it's downstream. So the phenotype of g1g2 would be same as g2, which is what we see here.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So, G3's effect is only seen when G2 is present. So G2 is acting upstream of G3 as well.

What about g1g3? That's 10%. So in the double mutant of G1 and G3, the resistance is 10% of control. Which is worse than either individual mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So their combined effect is additive or synergistic.

Wait, in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. Together, it's 10%. So, that's much worse. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because knocking both out leads to a much more severe phenotype than either alone. So their functions don't overlap much, but they both contribute to resistance. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower.

But wait,
