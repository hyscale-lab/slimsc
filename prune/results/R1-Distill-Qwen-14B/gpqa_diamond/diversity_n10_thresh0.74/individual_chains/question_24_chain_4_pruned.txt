Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.

The question talks about two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, X undergoes some reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably a saturated compound like an alkane.

Another point is that mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So the liquids in X probably have double bonds that aren't conjugated. 

Let me break this down. So X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. That usually means they have unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which react with bromine. But since X doesn't have conjugated double bonds, perhaps they're simple alkenes or maybe isolated double bonds.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y, and this is a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one element is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait, in what context? Oh, maybe X contains a diene or some structure that can undergo some kind of split into two different products.

Wait, but when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a catalyst for certain reactions. If X reacts to form Y through a reaction that changes the structure of the molecules, maybe a splitting reaction. Since Y is also equimolar, perhaps X is a diene that breaks into two smaller molecules. Or maybe X has a molecule that can split into two different compounds.

Wait, the key here is that after hydrogenation, both X and Y give the same product Z. So X and Y must have structures that, when hydrogenated, result in the same molecule. But how? Because X and Y are different mixtures.

Wait, let me think again. Hydrogenation is adding hydrogen across double bonds. So if X has some double bonds, hydrogenation would saturate them. Similarly for Y. But if both lead to the same Z, then perhaps X and Y have structures that hydrogenate to the same Z.

But wait, the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one substance Z. So for each mixture, hydrogenation leads to Z. So each component in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z, and same for Y's components. So X's components hydrogenate to Z, Y's components also hydrogenate to Z.

So, X has two compounds, say A and B, which when hydrogenated give Z. Similarly, Y has two compounds, C and D, which also when hydrogenated give Z.

But since Y is formed from X via a reaction with Pt and heating, perhaps the reaction is a splitting of one of the components in X into two different products, which become the components of Y.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is another mixture of two liquids, so perhaps X has one compound that splits into two upon reaction, making Y's components.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible structures.

Given that Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen. Let me calculate that. So the mass fraction is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So the molecular formula of Z must have H as 1/7 of the total mass.

Wait, let me compute the exact value. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is roughly 0.1428. So if the molecular mass is M, then (mass of H atoms) = 0.1428*M.

Hydrogen has an atomic mass of about 1.008. Suppose Z is CnH2m. The mass of H would be 2m * 1.008. So 2m * 1.008 = 0.1428 * (12n + 2m *1.008).

Let me rearrange this. Let me approximate 1.008 as 1 for simplicity.

So, 2m ≈ 0.1428 * (12n + 2m)

Multiply both sides: 2m = 0.1428 * 12n + 0.1428 * 2m

Bring the 0.1428*2m term to left:

2m - 0.2856 m = 1.7136n

1.7144 m = 1.7136n (approximately, considering 0.2856 is about 2 * 0.1428)

Wait, that suggests m ≈ n. Let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. So 0.1428 = 1/7.

So,

mass of H = (1/7) * (12n + 2m)

But mass of H is 2m * 1.008. So,

2m * 1.008 = (12n + 2m) * (1/7)

Multiply both sides by 7:

14 m * 1.008 = 12n + 2m

14.112 m = 12n + 2m

Subtract 2m both sides:

12.112 m = 12n

Divide both sides by 12:

m = (12n)/(12.112) ≈ n*(12/12.112) ≈ 0.9909n

Hmm, so m is approximately 0.99n, which suggests m ≈ n. So perhaps n is 7, m is 7, but 2m =14, which would make the formula C7H14?

Wait, but wait, 14.28% is H mass. Let's compute for C7H14.

Molecular mass = (7*12) +14 = 84 +14=98.

Hydrogen mass is 14 * 1.008 ≈14.112 g/mol.

So, the fraction is 14.112 /98 ≈0.144, which is 14.4%, which is close to 14.28%. So perhaps Z is C7H14.

Wait, but C7H14 is an alkane? No, wait: alkanes have formula CnH2n+2. For n=7, it's C7H16. So C7H14 is a diene, perhaps. But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. So maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think: another possibility is C5H12? Let's check.

C5H12: molecular mass is 5*12 +12 = 60+12=72. H mass is 12 *1.008≈
