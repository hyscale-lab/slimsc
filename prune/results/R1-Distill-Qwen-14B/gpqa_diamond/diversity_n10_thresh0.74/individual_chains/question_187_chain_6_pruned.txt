Okay, I'm trying to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. So the question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure needing to be at least 10. 

First, I need to recall what factors affect the S/N ratio in spectroscopy. I remember that S/N depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like readout and background.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's probably more sensitive than older instruments. But wait, the key here is to determine which stars are bright enough to reach S/N of 10 per pixel in one hour.

So each star's detectability depends on its apparent magnitude as seen from Earth because that determines how much light we receive. The formula for S/N is S/N = (flux * exposure time) / noise, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of magnitude.

I think that the S/N for a star depends on its apparent magnitude. The formula I remember is that the S/N per pixel improves with the square root of the exposure time, and it's proportional to the flux from the star. Flux is higher for brighter stars (lower magnitudes).

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. I think the S/N ratio for a star of magnitude m observed for time t with a telescope of diameter D is something like S/N ∝ (D^2) * (10^(-0.4*m)) * sqrt(t) / (noise terms). 

Wait, the noise in the S/N comes from various sources—like the sky background, read noise, etc. But maybe for the purposes of this question, the main factor is the star's brightness, so apparent magnitude. 

So first, let's figure out the apparent magnitude of each star. The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance d using the formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

Let's compute m for each star:

a) Canopus: I know Canopus is a bright star. Its absolute magnitude is around -5.7. But wait, I might be mixing up. Let me think. Canopus is the second brightest star in the sky, so its apparent magnitude is about -0.7. But for the absolute magnitude, M, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, so maybe M for Canopus is approximately -5.7. So if it's located at, let's say, about 75 pc away (I think that's roughly correct), then m = M +5 log10(d/10). So M is about -5.7, d is 75 pc.

So m = -5.7 + 5 * log10(75/10) = -5.7 +5 * log10(7.5) → log10(7.5) is about 0.875. 5 * 0.875 = 4.375. So m = -5.7 +4.375 ≈ -1.325. So Canopus has an apparent magnitude of about -1.3. That's very bright.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star, which is a variable star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2.0, but I'm not certain. Wait, no. I think it's actually brighter. Wait, no, I think that's correct. Wait, let me think. The North Star is about magnitude 2 (I might be wrong; I'll double-check in a moment). Alternatively, is it around 1.8? Wait, I might be mixing up. Let's see, the Sun is -26.7, Sirius is about -1.5, Canopus is about -0.7, so Polaris is fainter than Canopus. Let me check: I think I'm wrong. Wait, actually, Polaris is a Cepheid variable, so it varies, but its average apparent magnitude is around 2.0. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's brighter than that. Wait, okay, perhaps I should look up the approximate values. Alternatively, maybe I can just proceed with the assumption that Polaris is a star with a certain absolute magnitude and distance. Wait, but the question provides M, but for a) and b), I don't have M and distance. Hmm, wait, no. The options a) and b) are specific stars, so I need to know their apparent magnitudes.

Wait, looking back at the question, options a) Canopus and b) Polaris are given without M or distance. So I need to know their apparent magnitudes.

Canopus: Apparent magnitude is about -0.72 (I think). So m =
