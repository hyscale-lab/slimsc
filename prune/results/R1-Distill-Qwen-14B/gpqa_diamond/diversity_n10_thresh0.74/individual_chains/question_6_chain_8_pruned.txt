Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions. Hmm, let's see.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, that looks like a combination of terms. Let me break it down. The first part, (1/2)kr², is familiar. Oh, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions because in polar coordinates, r² is x² + y², which is the radial part of the 2D harmonic oscillator.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Remember, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's calculate that: (3/2)(1/2) = 3/4. So that's (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). Expanding this, it's (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait a second, the entire potential V is the sum of the two terms. Let's add them up:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in 2D, polar coordinates can sometimes be tricky, but maybe it's separable into x and y directions.

Wait, let me think about the angular part. The term (3/4)kr² cos2θ can be expressed in terms of x and y. Since cos2θ is cos²θ - sin²θ, but more importantly, perhaps using Cartesian coordinates, because in 2D, the potential can be expressed as a harmonic oscillator in x and y.

Wait, another approach: if I express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates
