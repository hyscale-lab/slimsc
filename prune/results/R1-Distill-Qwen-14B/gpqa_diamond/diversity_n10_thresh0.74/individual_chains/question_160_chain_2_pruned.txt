Okay, so I've got this physics problem about diffraction patterns, right? Hmm, let me think. The question is about an aperture that's shaped like a N-sided polygon with all apothems of length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity.

Wait, wait. I remember that when N is very large, like approaching infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Oh right, that makes sense because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

But wait, the options don't include the standard first minimum for a circular aperture. Let me think again. The standard single-slit diffraction pattern has a minimum at sinθ = λ/a, right? But wait, that's for a single slit. No, wait, no, the single-slit has the first minimum at λ/a, but a circular aperture (like a pinhole camera) has its first minimum given by the Rayleigh criterion which is approximately sinθ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. Oh wait, but in this problem, the apothem is given as a. Hmm, wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R. How? Oh right, the apothem a = R * cos(π/N), since each side is a triangle with central angle 2π/N. But when N is large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So, as N approaches infinity, the apothem a becomes approximately equal to the radius R.

Wait, but in the problem, the apothem is a. So for a circle, the apothem would be R, which is the radius. So the diameter would be 2a. So the Rayleigh criterion for the first minimum is about 1.22 λ/(2a), but wait no, the formula is 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter. So if D is 2a, then the angle is 1.22 λ/(
