Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on. 

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking for the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Point P is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. The angle between l and s is theta. And l and L are both greater than R. 

Wait, so the setup is a bit like a spherical shell with a cavity, but the cavity isn't at the center. The charge is somewhere inside this cavity, but not at the center. Hmm. I remember that conductors in electrostatics have some properties, like charges reside on the surface. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When we place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's behavior changes.

So, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was uncharged before, the inner surface must develop an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So, if the charge inside is +q, the inner surface will have -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, but the conductor was initially neutral. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. The charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface must have -q, leaving the outer surface with +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when calculating the electric field at P, I should consider the charges outside the Gaussian surface that encloses P. Wait, no, Gaussian surfaces... In electrostatics, the electric field outside a conductor depends on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface.

But wait, the conductor is a spherical shell, but the cavity isn't at the center. So the charges on the inner surface are arranged such that they cancel the field inside the conductor. Oh, right, the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatics is zero. So the charges on the inner surface will arrange themselves to produce an electric field that cancels the field due to the charge in the cavity, within the conductor.

Wait, but how does that work when the cavity isn't centered? So if the cavity is shifted, the charge inside would induce charges on the inner surface in a way that creates a field that cancels the internal field. But I'm not sure about this. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effect of the induced charges on the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the induced charges on the inner surface are -q, and the outer surface must have +q. So, from an external point, the field should be as if the charge +q is located at the center of the conductor. Because the induced charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed, assuming the conductor is a perfect sphere.

Wait, but in this case, the cavity is not centered. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is off-center. So the induced charge on the inner surface of the conductor will be -q, but arranged how?

I think in such a case, the induced charge on the inner surface would produce an electric field that exactly cancels the field due to the charge +q at all points inside the conductor. So, the inner surface's induced charge is like a point charge located at the center of the cavity.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the way the induced charge is distributed on the inner surface depends on the position of the charge. If the cavity is not at the center, the charge in the cavity will cause the inner surface to have an induced charge that looks like a dipole or something else. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, for a point charge inside a non-centered cavity in a conductor, the induced charges would arrange in such a way that their field cancels the original charge's field within the conductor. So the induced charge distribution on the inner surface would be such that their field inside the conductor is opposite to the field due to +q.

But wait, for a spherical conductor, the induced charge will arrange in a way that the conductor's interior is shielded from external fields. But in this case, the charge inside the cavity is what's inducing the inner surface charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution can be considered as a point charge located at the center of the cavity. Because that's where the +q is. Since the conductor shields the interior, the field inside the conductor is zero, so the induced charge must produce a field that cancels the +q's field within the conductor.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the Gaussian surfaces. If I take a Gaussian surface inside the conductor (but outside the cavity), the electric field there is zero. So the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. But the charge in the cavity is +q. So the inner surface must have -q. The outer surface then has +q.

Wait, but the inner surface is a sphere with radius R, but the cavity is of radius r and located at a distance s from the center. So the inner surface is the actual conductor's inner surface. The charge on the inner surface is -q, and it's distributed in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. But the location of the charge inside the cavity affects how the inner surface's charge is distributed.

Wait, maybe the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform because the charge is off-center. So the inner surface has a dipole or something. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the inner surface's charge distribution is such that it creates a field that exactly cancels the field due to +q inside the conductor.

But for a point charge inside a cavity, the inner surface's induced charge is like a point charge located at the same point as the cavity's center. So the inner surface's charge is -q, but as a shell. So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the induced charges on the inner surface won't contribute because they're inside the Gaussian surface.

Wait no, that's not right. The Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose both the inner surface charge (-q) and the outer surface charge (+q), but since the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero.

But when you're outside the conductor, the field is due to the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which includes all charges inside. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be as if it's a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. How does that affect the field outside?

Ah, wait. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the induced charges on the outer surface are distributed in such a way that the field outside is that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's induced charge, +q, is spherically symmetric. So regardless of where the charge +q is inside the cavity, the outer surface's induced charge is uniformly distributed, making the external field as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but that can't be right because the charge in the cavity is not at the center. Or is it?

Wait, no, because the conductor shields the effects of charges inside. The outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the total charge on the conductor, which is +q. So the field outside is as if the +q is located at the center of the conductor. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field. That's the shielding effect.

So, for the point P outside, which is a distance L from the center of the conductor, which is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity, the electric field at P would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. The angle theta is between l and s. Hmm, but if the field outside depends only on the conductor's outer charge, which is at the center, then the position of the charge in the cavity doesn't matter. So the field at P is the same as that due to a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field E at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L² ), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/L²), which would make sense.

But wait, let me think again. If the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the external field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

So the point P is outside, so the field is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor.

So using Coulomb's law, E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L² ), because L is the distance from P to the center of the conductor.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor develops a charge $+q$. The electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is uniformly distributed due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor.

The shielding effect of the conductor ensures that the field outside is as if the charge $+q$ were located at the center of the conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. Thus, the electric field at point $P$, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **A** and **C** involve distances related to the cavity's center, but the field outside depends only on the total charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is uniformly distributed.
- **D** incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center) instead of $L$ (the distance from $P$ to the conductor's center).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
