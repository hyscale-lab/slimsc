Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're part of a system with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically Planet3's period compared to Planet1's. The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's.

The given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
Wait, wait, actually, equilibrium temperature is usually given by the formula T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but I think in this context, the ratio could be based on the inverse square law for flux. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis and the star's luminosity.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), assuming albedo is zero. But wait, albedo is given as 0.3, so the formula would have to account for that. The actual formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2 a (1 - albedo)) )^(1/2) ). Hmm, maybe I should think about the ratio of their temperatures first.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature T scales with the inverse square root of the semi-major axis (a) and the square root of (1 - albedo). But since albedo is the same for all, the (1 - albedo) term is the same, so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), which means a ∝ 1/(T^2).

So, for the temperature ratios:

Planet1 to Planet2: T1/T2 = 1.4. So, T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), then sqrt(a1/a2) = T2/T1. So a1/a2 = (T2/T1)^2. Since T1 is larger, T2 is lower, so a1 is larger than a2? Wait, no. Wait, if T1 is larger than T2, and T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), then a1 must be smaller than a2. Because a larger T implies being closer to the star (smaller a).

Wait, let me rephrase. If T1 is larger than T2, and T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), then sqrt(a1) = (T2 / T1) * sqrt(a2). Wait, maybe I should write the ratio of a's.

Let me think: T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a1(1 - a))) ), but all planets have the same star and same R_star and albedo, so for each planet, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T ∝ 1/s
