Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the angular momentum states of two electrons in p orbitals. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

So, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1, right? Because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, etc. So each electron has l1 =1 and l2=1. 

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm. So l is 2, and m is -1. Wait, but wait. The combined angular momentum of two particles is the sum of their individual angular momenta. Oh but wait, angular momenta can add in different ways. For two particles, each with l=1, the possible total L values are 2 (max), 1, or 0. So l=2 is possible, but what does the state |l1, l2, l, m> actually mean for the possible m values?

Wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m value is -1. But how does that relate to the individual m1 and m2 quantum numbers?

I think that the coupled state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and the z-component (Lz). So when you have a coupled state like |l, m>, it is a combination of the product states of the individual m1 and m2 states.

But wait, the problem is asking about the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. Oh, because each L1z and L2z would have eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ. So if each is measured to be -ħ, that would mean m1= -1 and m2= -1, right? Because L1z |m1> = m1ħ |m1>, so if the eigenvalue is -ħ, m1 must be -1. Same for m2.

So the question is, what's the probability that when you measure m1 and m2, both are -1, given that the state is |1,1,2,-
