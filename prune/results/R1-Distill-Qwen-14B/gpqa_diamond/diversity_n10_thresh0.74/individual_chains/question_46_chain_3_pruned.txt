Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when it's treated with Grubbs catalyst, and I should exclude ethene. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. It's a process where the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs is typically a ring-closing catalyst, but I think it can also do ring-opening or other metathesis reactions depending on the structure.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, but since the molecule has a double bond, I should look at its structure. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. So structure would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH3? No, wait, wait. Or is it CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So positions 1 and 2 are double bonded. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me write it correctly.

3-methylpent-1-ene: the pent means five carbons, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. So the first carbon is CH₂-, second is CH-, third is CH(CH3), fourth is CH₂, fifth is CH3? Hmm, no. Wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the numbering.

Wait, pent-1-ene: the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Let me count.

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, but that's five carbons in a row. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3
