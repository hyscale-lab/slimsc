Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the setup: They've tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and given them to mice orally. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because stomach acid is really strong and can break down proteins, right? So some of the tagged proteins probably got broken down there. But some made it through and got entangled in the intestinal mucus. Wait, mucus in the intestines is a barrier, so maybe those proteins didn't make it all the way to the secondary lymphoid organs either. But the ones that did? They found the fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? Theyâ€™re these small structures that sample antigens in the gut and are crucial for mucosal immunity.

Then they isolated the proliferating cell population from these patches. So, what kind of cells proliferate there? Probably B cells, because when an antigen is taken up, the B cells get activated and start dividing. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and found high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process is causing the genes to change.

Now, the question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let's think about each option.

A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM): This is a process where B cells introduce point mutations in their variable region genes during the immune response. It increases the diversity of antibodies, allowing for better recognition of antigens. SHM typically happens during the germinal center reactions, where B cells undergo proliferation and mutation. So if these cells are proliferating and their variable regions are diverse, SHM might be the process.

B) Complement activation: This has to do with the complement system, which is part of the immune response. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction by opsonization or causing lysis. But I don't think this process directly affects the variable regions of antibodies. So probably not B.

C) Class switching recombination (CSR): This is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). It involves recombination at the heavy chain locus. But class switching doesn't change the variable regions, just the class. The variable regions are already set, so the high variability in variable genes wouldn't come from this. So probably not C.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. But VDJ happens during maturation, leading to initial diversity. If the question is about cells that have already been exposed to antigen and are proliferating, like in a response, then this isn't happening in the same way. Plus, the cells here are already mature, so D might not be the right answer here.

So the key is that the variable regions are showing high variability after the immune response. Somatic hypermutation is the process that happens after the initial diversity from VDJ. It's an adaptive mechanism to increase the affinity of the antibodies. So the cells in the Peyer's patches that are proliferating are likely undergoing SHM to diversify their receptors.

Another point: Peyer's patches are involved in sampling antigens, so the B cells there are activated. The variable heavy chains' high variability suggests that each B cell has a slightly different receptor, which is exactly what SHM does. It's a process that occurs in germinal centers, which are part of lymphoid tissues that respond to antigens.

So putting it all together, the process is somatic hypermutation. The answer should be A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability, suggesting a process that alters the variable regions of antibodies.

To determine the correct process:

- **Somatic hypermutation (SHM)** introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors during the immune response, increasing diversity and affinity for antigens. This process occurs in germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and diversify their receptors. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes aligns with SHM.

- **Complement activation** involves the complement system marking pathogens for destruction but does not directly alter the variable regions of antibodies, making it unlikely.

- **Class switching recombination (CSR)** changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions, so it does not explain the observed variability.

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in the variable regions. However, this process is not relevant to mature B cells undergoing an immune response, making it an unlikely explanation.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in response to antigen exposure and drives diversification of B cell receptors. This process fits the context of the experiment, where B cells in the Peyer patches are activated and proliferating.

Answer: A
