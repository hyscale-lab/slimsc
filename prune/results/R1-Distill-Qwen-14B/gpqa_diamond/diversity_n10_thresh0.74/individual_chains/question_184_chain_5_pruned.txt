Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break that down.

First, I'll draw the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, numbering gets tricky. Oh right, in benzene numbering, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So, if the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, that's a meta arrangement. Wait, no, 1,2,3 would actually be adjacent positions, but I'm not sure. Let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, and 3 would be in a row, so each adjacent. Oh wait, no, that's not possible. Oh wait, no, in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. So 1, 2, and 3 would form a sort of triangle. But the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So they are all meta to each other? Or maybe each adjacent.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about
