Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. A chemist found a white solid, and they're trying to identify it using spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

First, let's go through the data step by step. The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ion is the highest mass, so the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The peak at 158 must be something else, maybe a fragment or an isotope. Wait, if the molecular weight is 156, 158 is two mass units higher. That could be due to a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has isotopes at about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%) abundance. So if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have 75% abundance, but the 37Cl would give a peak at m/z 158, which is 25% of the main peak. But in the data, the peak at 158 is 32%, which is a bit higher than 25%. Hmm, maybe there's more than one chlorine? Or perhaps it's not chlorine? Let me think.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The sharp peak at 1720 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So, something like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid. But the broad peak suggests an -OH group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H is broad due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but that's not matching the IR here. The IR's broad peak here is more like a strong O-H from an acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). An singlet at 11 ppm is a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton (RCHO) because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Wait, but wait: in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. However, the NMR here shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which might fit either a carboxylic acid (if it's a sharp singlet, but usually, it's a broad peak) or an aldehyde. Wait, but another thing
