Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reaction steps.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. So, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw this mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position numbering is important here.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, numbering them: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so the numbering could be relative. Hmm. So, substituents are at 1,2,3. Wait, that's adjacent to each other. So, the substituents are in a meta arrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say position 1 is where the ethoxy group is attached. Then, position 2 is adjacent to that (so next to it) has the tert-butyl group. Then position 3 is the next one with nitro. Wait, so ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, in a row. That's a meta arrangement for the nitro group relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.

Wait, but benzene has only three substituents here. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But wait, benzene can't have three substituents in a row if it's a six-membered ring. Oh, okay, 1,2,3 would be in a row, so they're all adjacent.

Wait, but substituting benzene with three groups in such a way could lead to some steric issues, but the problem is about reaction sequences, not about steric feasibility.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3.

Now, thinking about the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, we need to introduce these groups.

In electrophilic substitution reactions, the order in which groups are introduced can affect where subsequent substituents add because of directing effects.

Benzene is an electron-rich ring, so when we substitute, the substituents usually direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions.

Let me think about the directing effects of each substituent:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (through lone pairs from oxygen). It's an ortho/para director.
- tert-Butyl group (t-Bu): It's a bulky, weakly activating group. Since it's an alkyl group, it donates electrons via induction, but the bulky nature might hinder substitution. It's a strong activating group and an ortho/para director, but due to its size, para substitution may be more favorable.
- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a deactivating, meta-directing group because it's electron-withdrawing.

Wait, the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (t-Bu) and position 1 (ethoxy). So the nitro is in the meta position relative to ethoxy? Or is it in the ortho position relative to t-Bu?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of adding substituents. Since the nitro group is deactivating, it's better to add it after activating groups, because adding nitro early would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder.

Alternatively, perhaps adding the nitro group first would not be ideal because then the next substituents would have a harder time adding.

Wait, wait, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. Let's think about the order.

Option 1: Add the nitro group first. But then the ring is deactivating, so any subsequent substitution would be difficult.

Option 2: Add the ethoxy and t-Bu groups first, which are activating, then add nitro.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So if I have two activating groups already on the ring, where would the nitro group add?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that's activated by the existing groups.

Wait, maybe the order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the t-Bu group, and then the nitro group.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is a strong activating group (since it's an electron-donating group via resonance), so when it's attached, it will direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Similarly, the t-Bu group is a strong activating group (alkyl) and also directs ortho and para.

But let's think: if I add the ethoxy group first, then the t-Bu group next.

So, adding ethoxy to benzene: benzene → ethoxybenzene (using, say, ethyl chloride and AlCl3 as catalyst, Friedel-Crafts alkylation? Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts would be for alkyl halides. Wait, ethoxy group is an ether, so maybe it's introduced via nucleophilic substitution, but more likely, benzene is attacked by an electrophilic species. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group can be introduced via another method.

Wait, no—actually, benzene is inert. To introduce an ethoxy group, we typically use, for example, ethyl chloride with a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3 in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to give methyl groups because of carbocation rearrangements, but for ethers, perhaps it's an alkoxy group introduced via some other method.

Wait, no—Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation and acylation. For introducing an ether group, perhaps it's better to use a different approach, like the Williamson ether synthesis. But wait, that's when you have an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide. So perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution or some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nitration followed by other steps. Hmm. Alternatively, for introducing an ether group, maybe a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually for deactivated rings, so perhaps not the first step.

Wait, maybe the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Because tert-butyl chloride is a good candidate for Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene + t-BuCl with AlCl3 would form tert-butylbenzene.

Then, perhaps the next step is adding the ethoxy group. Since the t-Bu group is an activating, ortho/para director, adding ethoxy would go into ortho or para position relative to t-Bu.

Wait, but wait: if the t-Bu group is at position 1, where would ethoxy go? It could go at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Hmm, but then the nitro group would have to go at position 3. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's say we nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then, nitro is a meta director. Adding t-BuCl next. Since nitro is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but t-BuCl may undergo Friedel-Crafts, but wait, nitro is a meta director. So the t-Bu would add in the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 3 (if nitro is at position 1, then meta is position 4? No, wait, in a benzene ring, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So if nitro is at position 1, the meta would be position 4. So the t-Bu would go to position 4, but that's para to nitro, but wait, no, nitro is a meta director. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should outline the possible steps for each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the options, each one is a list of steps i) to ix), but wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me look at option D, for example.

Option D:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.
ii) Fe/HCl → this is a reduction condition. Fe/HCl is used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but wait, nitro groups can be reduced with Fe/HCl as well. Oh, wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine with H2/Pd, but with Fe/HCl, it's more likely a different reaction. Wait, maybe nitro group is converted to something else. Alternatively, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, after nitration, step ii) is Fe/HCl. So nitrobenzene plus Fe and HCl. Fe/HCl is acidic conditions, perhaps a reduction. Nitro groups can be reduced in acidic conditions with, say, Sn/HCl or Fe/HCl to produce an amine. So nitrobenzene → phenylamine (aniline). But then, next step is tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But aniline is a very activating group, so the alkylation would occur in certain positions.

Wait, but after the reduction, the ring has an amine group. Then, AlCl3 and t-BuCl would probably undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but aniline is strongly activating, so the alkylation would be directed to ortho and para positions.

But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, but it's a meta director when attached because the lone pair of the amine is in the plane of the ring, but I'm not sure. Actually, aniline is an ortho/para director because the lone pair can activate those positions.

Wait, but after adding the amine group, adding a t-Bu group via Friedel-Crafts would go ortho or para to the amine. Then, what's next?

Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

Let me think about the possible order of adding substituents. Since the nitro group is a deactivating substituent, it's better to add it last because adding it earlier would make the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions.

So maybe the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.

2. Introduce t-Bu group.

3. Introduce nitro group.

But wait, how would the nitro group be introduced? Because once the ring has two activating groups, the next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position activated by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced in a position that is activated by the existing groups.

Wait, let's think about this. When you have two substituents on a benzene ring, the substituents can either be mutually activating or deactivating, and their directing effects can compete.

So, for ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-Bu (activating, ortho/para), their combined influence would direct incoming groups to positions where both substituents' effects are additive.

Wait, if I have ethoxy at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, then where would the nitro group go?

Nitration would be directed by the activating groups. The nitro group is usually introduced via nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution, and the nitro group is a meta director. But wait, the existing substituents are activating, so the nitro group would have to be added in a position that is directed by these groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that's activated by both substituents.

Wait, if the ethoxy is at position 1 and t-Bu at position 2, then the meta position relative to ethoxy would be position 4. The meta relative to t-Bu would be position 5. So, maybe the nitro group ends up at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and t-Bu?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the positions. Benzene ring: positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, then the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. The next substituent (nitro) could come in at position 3. How would the directing work?

Wait, ethoxy is at 1, which is an activating group. So it directs to ortho (2) and para (4). t-Bu is at 2, which is ortho to ethoxy. So the next substituent could be in a position that's ortho or para to both substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of ortho/para directors, the nitration would occur at the position that is meta to both, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that's activated by both substituents.

Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think about the reaction sequences in the options.

Looking at Option C: The steps are:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add t-Bu to benzene. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So introducing a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Then, step iii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So now, the ring has t-Bu and SO3 groups.

Wait, since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta director, and t-Bu is activating, ortho/para director.

But wait, when multiple substituents are present, the substituent with the strongest directing effect tends to dominate. Sulfonic acid is strongly deactivating, so it would dominate, making the ring deactivating overall. So the nitration would be directed by the sulfonic acid group, which is meta to it.

But then, in step iv: Fe/HCl → this is a reducing step, perhaps reducing the nitro group to an amine. Wait, but if nitration was done after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid group is present. Then, perhaps the nitro group is in a position meta to sulfonic acid, and then reduced.

Wait, but after that, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Then step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis. That could produce a phenol if the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. But with a sulfonic acid group, that's a strong acid, so perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try to think about each option's sequence.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → Reduction of nitro group to amine (aniline).

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add ortho or para to it.

But wait, after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is highly activated. Adding t-BuCl via AlCl3 would likely add in ortho or para to the amine group.

Then, step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Now, the ring has an amine group and a t-Bu group. But amine is a strong activating group, so nitration would be directed by it.

Wait, but after adding t-Bu and amine, the ring is more activated. Nitration would likely add in positions ortho or para to the amine.

But I'm not seeing how this would lead to the target molecule with substituents in 1,2,3.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are adding the nitro group later.

Wait, let me think about the target structure. The target has nitro, ethoxy, and t-Bu substituents. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituent positions.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro).

So, the ring has substituents in adjacent positions: 1,2,3.

But how are these substituents introduced in order?

Let me think about the order of introduction.

One possible order is:

1. Add t-Bu group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group.

Because ethoxy and t-Bu are activating, making the ring reactive enough for nitration.

So, benzene → t-Bu benzene via Friedel-Crafts.

Then, introduce ethoxy group. Since t-Bu is an ortho/para director, the ethoxy would add either ortho or para to t-Bu.

Wait, but where would that place it? If t-Bu is at position 1, then ethoxy could be at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para).

Then, adding the nitro group. Now, the ring has ethoxy and t-Bu groups. Nitration would be directed by these groups.

Wait, but ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it will dominate the direction. Nitration would add in ortho or para to ethoxy.

So, if ethoxy is at 2, then nitration would add at position 1 (para) or 3 (ortho) relative to ethoxy.

Wait, but position 1 is already taken by t-Bu. So nitration would add at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy.

That would give substituents at positions 1 (t-Bu), 2 (ethoxy), 3 (nitro). Which matches the target.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is the case. Because when you have two substituents, the most activating one would dominate the directing.

Wait, ethoxy is more activating than t-Bu, as ethoxy is an electron-donating group via resonance, whereas t-Bu is only via induction. So ethoxy would dominate.

So, if ethoxy is at position 2, then nitration would go para (position 6) or ortho (position 1 or 3).

But position 1 is t-Bu, so nitration can't go there. So, it would go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy) or position 6 (para).

But the target requires nitro at position 3. So that's possible.

So, the steps would be:

Add t-Bu → add ethoxy → add nitro.

But the question is, how do these steps fit into the options.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu to benzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, that's adding a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating group. But that would deactivate the ring, making further substitution difficult. So this might not be the right sequence.

Alternatively, option A:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. But the ring is activated by t-Bu, so nitration would add nitro group.

But where? t-Bu is an ortho/para director, so nitro would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say position 3 or 5 if t-Bu is at 1.

Then, step iii: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Would this add another substituent? Or perhaps it's a sulfonation step for some other purpose.

I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step in each option.

Option D:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro group to amine (aniline).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu adds to aniline.

Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add in ortho or para to amine.

So, if amine is at position 1, t-Bu could be at 2 or 4.

Then, iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

But the ring now has amine and t-Bu. Nitration would be directed by the amine (stronger activating), so nitro would go ortho or para to amine.

But that's getting more nitro groups, which isn't in the target. The target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps option D is not the right sequence.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So, nitro added.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 again → another nitration.

But again, not helpful for our target.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. Wait, but how?

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be introduced via an alkoxy group from a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring, like with a nitro group present.

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating, making the ring less reactive, so nucleophilic substitution is unlikely. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, but ethoxy is an ether. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 mechanism, but benzene isn't very reactive towards such mechanisms without strong activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as a later substituent, after the ring has activating groups.

Wait, perhaps the order is: add t-Bu, then nitro, then ethoxy. But that might not work because nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a good leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps in the correct option, the steps involve adding t-Bu, then ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts alkylation (but ethoxy is not an alkyl halide; perhaps it's done differently), then nitration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, such as using NaOH and ethyl bromide in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly activated ring, which might not be the case unless there's a meta-directing group activating the ring.

Wait, maybe after adding t-Bu and nitro groups, but no, nitro is deactivating.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again about the target structure. The target has substituents at 1,2,3. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions. So, their order of addition could be important in determining their positions.

Assuming the correct order is t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro, let's see which option does that.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolyze diazonium salt to phenol.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe sulfonation again.

viii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxy group via substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced later via an alkoxy group substitution.

Wait, perhaps in the correct option, after adding t-Bu and nitro groups, then the ethoxy is introduced in a position that is activated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after creating a good leaving group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but that doesn't seem right.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, such as using Williamson's synthesis, but that usually requires an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, which might not be applicable to benzene.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but with an ethyl group, but that would give an ethyl group, not an ethoxy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group. Let me think: adding t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But that would require the ring to have a nitro group (deactivating) and t-Bu (activating). So, the nitro group is a meta director, and t-Bu is ortho/para.

So when adding ethoxy, it would be directed by the t-Bu group, perhaps adding ortho or para to t-Bu. Then, the nitro group is already present, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation after the nitro group has been added.

But nitro groups deactivate the ring, making further electrophilic substitution difficult.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy and t-Bu groups first, then the nitro.

So, in that case, the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu to benzene.

2. Add ethoxy to benzene, directed by t-Bu.

3. Nitrate the benzene, directed by ethoxy and t-Bu.

This would lead to the nitro group being in position 3, as desired.

So, looking for a reaction sequence that first adds t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking at the options:

Option C:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate. This would add a sulfonic acid group, which is deactivating, making further substitution difficult. So perhaps this isn't the right path.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate. So, nitro would go ortho or para to t-Bu.

But then, in step iii, SO3 → sulfonate, which again would deactivate the ring.

Not sure.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, but that would add another nitro group, which isn't in the target.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce.

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

But again, this seems to add more nitro groups.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about introducing the ethoxy group via a different method. Another possibility is that the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a good leaving group, such as a nitro group already present in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding nitro first, then t-Bu, then ethoxy via substitution.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, making substitution difficult. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitration and amination.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for an option where t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking again at the options:

Option D's steps after step iii (t-Bu addition) include another nitration, but the order doesn't seem right.

Option C's steps after t-Bu addition involve sulfonation, which might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, let me re-examine option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. Since aniline is strongly activating, t-Bu adds ortho or para to amine.

So, if amine is at position 1, t-Bu could be at 2 or 4.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But wait, the ring now has amine and t-Bu. Nitro would go ortho or para to amine, which is already at 1. So nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to amine) or position 5 (para).

Wait, position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu at 2, so that's possible. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is next to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1).

But in option D, after step iv, we have two nitro groups, which isn't correct. So that's probably not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after the nitro group is added.

Wait, but how? Because nitro is deactivating.

Hmm, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a different method, such as a substitution.

Wait, perhaps in option D, after adding the t-Bu group (step iii), the next step is another nitration (iv), which adds nitro in the correct position. Then, steps v and vi involve diazotization and hydrolysis to form a phenol. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4, which might be sulfonation again, and step viii is H3O+ etc., which might be hydrolysis, and step ix is NaOH/EtBr for ethoxy substitution.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe after nitration, the nitro group is reduced, but I'm getting confused.

Another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strong electron-withdrawing group to activate the ring towards substitution.

So, perhaps after adding a nitro group, the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution. For example, if nitro is at position 1, then in a nucleophilic substitution, an ethoxide ion could attack at position 2, but that's adjacent. Alternatively, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, so they would direct incoming electrophiles to meta positions. But in nucleophilic substitution, perhaps the direction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is added, but I'm not sure.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the correct order of substituents and see which option matches.

The correct order to achieve 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro would require:

1. Add t-Bu at position 2.

2. Add ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to t-Bu).

3. Add nitro at position 3 (ortho to ethoxy).

So, the steps would be:

- Add t-Bu → add ethoxy → add nitro.

Looking for a sequence that does this.

Looking at option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate, which is bad because it deactivates the ring.

So, after sulfonate, nitration in step iii would be directed by the sulfonate group (meta), but that would not be adjacent.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate. Nitro would go ortho or para to t-Bu. Let's say position 3.

Then, step iii: SO3 → sulfonate. So now, the ring has t-Bu, nitro, and sulfonate.

Not matching the target.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. But now, the ring has t-Bu and amine. Nitration would be directed by amine to ortho or para.

So, perhaps adding another nitro group, which isn't desired.

Option D:

i) Nitrate first → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Add t-Bu → ortho or para to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

But again, this seems like adding more nitro groups.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is option D, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add t-Bu, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking for which option does that.

In option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate (bad, as it deactivates ring).

Not suitable.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

Then, SO3, etc. Not suitable.

Option B: steps after t-Bu and nitro involve reductions and more nitrations.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is in place, but that seems unlikely without an activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but that would require the ring to be activated.

Wait, another possibility: the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong EWG. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add nitro group.

2. Add t-Bu group.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let's look at option D's steps again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) t-BuCl → add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts. Now, aniline is activating, so t-Bu adds ortho or para to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has amine and t-Bu. Nitration would be directed by amine, which is activating, so nitro could go ortho or para to amine.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1).

Wait, perhaps after adding t-Bu, the ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Wait, option D's steps after step iii are:

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to phenol.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps sulfonation.

viii) H3O+ etc. → maybe another hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add nitro.

But how to achieve that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but ethoxy is not an alkyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's added via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

i) Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Add nitro via nitration.

iii) Introduce a leaving group (like Cl) via some substitution.

iv) Replace Cl with ethoxy.

But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration step.

But this is getting too ambiguous.

Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make an educated guess. Based on the target structure, the correct order is likely:

Add t-Bu first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Looking for an option that does this.

Option C's steps include adding SO3 after t-Bu, which is a problem because it deactivates.

Option A adds HNO3 after t-Bu, which may add nitro, but then the next steps don't seem to fit.

Option D adds nitro first, which seems less likely.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring has a nitro group, which is a strong EWG, making the ring more susceptible to such reactions.

So, steps could be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Add t-Bu group → but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. So maybe this isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding ethoxy via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, let me retrace option D:

i) Nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Add t-Bu → via Friedel-Crafts, adds ortho or para to amine.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro at position directed by amine (ortho or para).

But the target has only one nitro group, so this seems incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let's look again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate → nitro at ortho or para to t-Bu.

Assuming t-Bu is at 1, nitro would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step iii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

So, if nitro was at 2, it becomes amine at 2.

Then, step iv: HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, the ring has t-Bu (1) and amine (2). Nitration would go ortho or para to amine. So, possible positions are 1 (taken by t-Bu), 3 (ortho), and 5 (para).

If nitro is added at 3, that's the target's nitro position. But the target has nitro at 3, which would require this step.

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis to phenol.

Hmm, but that would replace the amine with a hydroxyl group. So, after step vi, the substituents would be t-Bu (1), hydroxyl (2), and nitro (3).

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps that's not matching.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. After step vi, you have phenol at position 2. Then, step vii: NaOH/EtBr → this is a condition for ethoxy group substitution via SN2, perhaps. So, phenol (position 2) would be replaced by ethoxy group.

But in that case, the substituents would be t-Bu (1), ethoxy (2), nitro (3), which matches the target.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, let's follow option B's steps:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu at position 1.

ii) HNO3 → nitro at position 2 (ortho to t-Bu).

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro at 2 to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again. Now, ring has t-Bu (1) and amine (2). Nitration would be directed by amine (strong activating) to ortho (3) or para (5). Let's say it goes to position 3.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine (2) to form a diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis of Diazonium salt to phenol at position 2.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → ethoxy group substitution at position 2.

Wait, but position 2 is where the phenol is. In NaOH and EtBr, perhaps the phenol is converted to ethoxy via some substitution.

But wait, phenol is a strong activating group, so in a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, but perhaps this is the correct sequence.

So, the steps in option B would lead to the target molecule.

Wait, but after step vi, the substituents would be t-Bu (1), phenol (2), nitro (3).

Then, step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's a condition for Williamson ether synthesis, which involves alkoxide ions and alkyl halides.

But how does that apply here? Perhaps the phenol (position 2) is treated with NaOH to form a phenoxide ion, which is a good nucleophile. Then, in the presence of EtBr, it would substitute to form the ethoxy group.

So, the phenol at position 2 would become ethoxy, and the nitro at 3 would remain.

So, the substituents would be t-Bu (1), ethoxy (2), nitro (3), which matches the target.

But wait, in option B, the steps are:

i) t-BuCl

ii) HNO3

iii) Fe/HCl

iv) HNO3

v) NaNO2/HCl

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat

vii) NaOH/EtBr

viii) SO3/H2SO4

ix) dilute H2SO4

Wait, after step vii, the substituents are as desired. Then, steps viii and ix are SO3 and dilute H2SO4, which would be sulfonation and something else. But that doesn't seem to fit, because the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group.

So, perhaps option B is not the correct choice.

Hmm. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Let me try to consider option C again.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate again.

vii) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct, but I'm not seeing the steps clearly.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll go with option D as the correct option, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, after adding t-Bu in step iii, the nitration in step iv would add nitro in the correct position. Then, the subsequent steps would introduce ethoxy.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so to save time, I'll make a decision.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). The analysis considers the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each reaction sequence in the options.

### Key Analysis of the Target Molecule
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy (-OCH2CH3)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl (-C(CH3)3)**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **Nitro (-NO2)**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Order of Substitution**:
   - The nitro group is deactivating, so it is better to add it last to avoid deactivating the ring prematurely.
   - The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating, so they should be added first to facilitate the introduction of the nitro group.

### Evaluation of Options
#### **Option A**:
1. **Steps**:
   - (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - (ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates the ring, directed by tert-butyl (ortho/para).
   - (iii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a deactivating group.
   - Subsequent steps do not align with the target structure.
2. **Conclusion**: The introduction of a sulfonic acid group deactivates the ring, making further substitution difficult. This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Steps**:
   - (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - (ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates the ring, directed by tert-butyl (ortho/para).
   - (iii) Fe/HCl: Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - (iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates again, directed by the amine (ortho/para).
   - (v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotizes the amine.
   - (vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol.
   - (vii) NaOH/EtBr: Substitutes the phenol with an ethoxy group.
2. **Conclusion**: This sequence introduces the nitro group twice, which is inconsistent with the target structure. The final substitution of the phenol with an ethoxy group is plausible, but the overall sequence does not yield the desired product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Steps**:
   - (i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Adds tert-butyl to benzene.
   - (ii) SO3/H2SO4: Sulfonates the ring, introducing a deactivating group.
   - (iii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates the ring, directed by the sulfonic acid group (meta).
   - Subsequent steps do not align with the target structure.
2. **Conclusion**: The introduction of a sulfonic acid group deactivates the ring, making further substitution difficult. This sequence does not lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Steps**:
   - (i) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates benzene to form nitrobenzene.
   - (ii) Fe/HCl: Reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - (iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, directed by the amine (ortho/para).
   - (iv) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitrates again, directed by the amine (ortho/para).
   - (v) NaNO2/HCl: Diazotizes the amine.
   - (vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol.
   - (vii) dilute H2SO4: Likely sulfonates the ring.
   - (viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat: Hydrolyzes the sulfonic acid group.
   - (ix) NaOH/EtBr: Substitutes the phenol with an ethoxy group.
2. **Conclusion**: While the sequence introduces the ethoxy group correctly, the repeated nitration and reduction steps are inconsistent with the target structure. The sequence does not yield the desired product.

### Final Decision
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option D** comes closest to the desired product, as it introduces the ethoxy group via substitution after hydrolysis of the phenol. Despite inconsistencies in the nitration steps, it is the most plausible sequence among the options.

**Answer: D**
