Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some kind of carboxylic acids. Let me jot down the given data:

FTIR:
- Very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. That usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But the broadness suggests it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H in those has a broader peak than in alcohols. Also, the peak at 1700 cm^-1 is strong. That's a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

1H NMR:
- No vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent C-H groups. So structures with any kind of alkene or alkyne are out. Looking at the options, I don't see any with vinyl groups, so maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the options again.

Options:
A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, that's like a four-carbon chain with substituents. Let's see: The structure would have CH3, then a CH attached to C2H5, then another CH attached to C2H5, then CH2, then COOH. So, the main chain is something like CH2CH2... Wait, maybe it's more like a branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2COOH.

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So, maybe the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the main chain is longer, with two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups and the COOH.

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Here, the structure would be CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2COOH. So two CH groups each attached to a methyl group.

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Structure would be CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the middle has two CH groups each with a methyl, and the chain is longer.

So all options have a carboxylic acid group (COOH), which fits the IR data. The IR peak at 1700 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the NMR data: several signals, none are vinyl. So the compound is saturated. All options are aliphatic, so that's good.

In the 1H NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let's think about splitting patterns.

A doublet of triplets of quartets would suggest a proton that's coupling with three different sets of neighboring protons. Let's think about how that could happen. Maybe the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has some branching that leads to a complex splitting. Let me think about the structures.

Looking at the options, I'll try to draw their structures:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH
So the structure is probably:
CH3
|
C(H)(C2H5)
|
C(H)(C2H
