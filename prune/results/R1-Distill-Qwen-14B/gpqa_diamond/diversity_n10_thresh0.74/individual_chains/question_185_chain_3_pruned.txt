Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get the hang of Hamiltonians and eigenvalues. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says the Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction. Epsilon is an energy constant. I need to find the eigenvalues of H.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. When you take their dot product with a vector n, you're essentially creating a new matrix that depends on the direction of n. But wait, the dot product would be the sum of each sigma component multiplied by the corresponding component of n, right? So like sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. Then H is epsilon times that sum.

Hmm, but wait, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices when multiplied by some vector. Oh, right! Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, their linear combinations are also Hermitian, so H should be Hermitian as well. That makes sense because Hamiltonians are supposed to be Hermitian, ensuring real eigenvalues.

Now, eigenvalues of a matrix like a·σ. Wait, suppose the spin matrices are multiplied by some coefficients. What's the eigenvalue for a spin-1/2 system in the direction of n? Oh! I think the eigenvalues of a·σ are plus and minus the magnitude of a. Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when you have terms like sigma_i. So if you have a vector a, the dot product a·sigma would have eigenvalues equal to the magnitude of a times plus or minus 1.

Wait, let me think about it more carefully. Let's say a is a vector. The operator a·σ is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are ±|a|. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you scale them, the eigenvalues scale accordingly. But wait, in our case, a is a unit vector multiplied by epsilon. Wait, no, wait: H is ε times (n · sigma), and n is a unit vector. So the vector a in a·σ would be ε n. But since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of a is |ε n| = ε * |n| =
