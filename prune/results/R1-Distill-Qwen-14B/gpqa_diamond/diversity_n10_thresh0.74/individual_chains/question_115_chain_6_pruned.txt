Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, first, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and positron have equal masses but opposite charges, their annihilation should obey conservation lawsâ€”like conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, so before the collision, the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving along the horizontal axis from the left). The positron is moving to the left (from the right). Both have Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate, right? It's gamma = total energy / rest mass energy.

So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. But wait, does the positron's direction matter? Oh, right, because it's moving in the opposite direction. So maybe I should consider their momenta separately.

Momentum for a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. But since gamma is given, and velocity can be found from gamma. Alternatively, I can use the relativistic momentum formula in terms of gamma. Oh, right, another formula is that the magnitude of momentum p is gamma * m * v. But velocity v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Wait, or perhaps it's easier to compute each particle's momentum.

Wait, but electrons and positrons have the same mass, m_e. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But I need to consider their directions. The electron is moving to the right, positron to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, no. Wait, when the positron is moving from the right, it's moving towards the left. So the positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction, while the electron's is positive x.

So I need to calculate the total momentum before annihilation.

So let's model this. Let me denote the right as positive x and up as positive y. So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e * x-hat. The positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e
