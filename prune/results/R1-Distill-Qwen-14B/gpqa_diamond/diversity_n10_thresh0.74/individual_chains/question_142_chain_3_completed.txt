Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to density matrices, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

First, let me recall what a density matrix represents. A density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace 1 and positive semi-definite.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write this out in matrix form. 

|0><0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. This looks familiar; I think this is the maximally mixed state. It represents a completely mixed state with equal probability of being in state |0⟩ or |1⟩. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what this exactly means. I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation value of the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So expanding that, ρ would be:

(1/2) [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
          [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

Comparing this to the given ρ:

Our ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So let's equate the two expressions.

Looking at the diagonal elements:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z =0.

And (1 - r_z)/2 must also be 1/2, which gives the same r_z=0.

Now the off-diagonal terms: our ρ has 0s, so the top right element is 0. The general form has (r_x - i r_y)/2. So,

(r_x - i r_y)/2 =0 → r_x - i r_y = 0. 

For a complex number to be zero, both real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, r_x =0 and r_y=0.

So putting it all together, r = (0, 0, 0). Wait, but that's one of the options, option C.

Wait, but wait a second. If the density matrix is the maximally mixed state, it's at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Because the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the origin is the completely mixed state (which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 ), right?

So the position would be (0,0,0). Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), D is (1,1,1) which doesn't make sense because each component can only be up to 1 in the Bloch sphere, but even so, that's not the case here.

So the answer should be option C. Let me double-check. Another way to think: the density matrix for the completely mixed state is indeed (I)/2, which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere because the Bloch vector is zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit, which corresponds to equal probabilities of the qubit being in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given density matrix:

1. The diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are \(\frac{1}{2}\), which implies \(r_z = 0\) (from the condition \((1 + r_z)/2 = \frac{1}{2}\)).
2. The off-diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\) (from the condition \((r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0\)).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is the geometrical position of the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not a mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**: Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid position for the given density matrix.

Answer: C
