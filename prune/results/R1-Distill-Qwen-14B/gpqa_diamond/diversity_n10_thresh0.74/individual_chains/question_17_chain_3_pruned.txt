Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also gave the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²⁻, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

Wait, the problem says it's the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that's the complex itself, meaning the solution is 0.02 M in CaY²⁻. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of how strong the complex is. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. The formula for Kf is [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this case, the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. But wait, no, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and the complex is CaY²⁻. So when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 M. The dissociation would be:

CaY²⁻ ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

So, the Kf is given as 5x10^10, but I think in this context, it's the formation constant. Wait no, when the complex dissociates, the reverse reaction would have a dissociation constant, Kd, which is 1/Kf. So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaY²⁻] =
