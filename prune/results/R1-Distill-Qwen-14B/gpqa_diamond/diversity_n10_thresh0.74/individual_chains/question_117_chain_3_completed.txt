Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds show optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? I think that's when compounds have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements, making them non-superimposable mirror images. So, which of the given compounds would exhibit that?

Let me look at each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, so biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If there are substituents that are in positions that allow for stereoisomerism, like on the same carbon but different positions. Oh, but wait, the substituents here are at 6,6' and 2,2'. So, the substituents are on both benzene rings. I'm a bit confused. But wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless there's some kind of substituents causing a plane of symmetry, maybe they can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but looking at the structure: 6 and 6' are nitro groups, and 2 and 2' are the ester groups. So, each benzene ring has OMe groups at 2 and nitro at 6. Wait, but is the arrangement such that the molecule is symmetric? Because if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, maybe there's no optical isomerism.

Wait, like if the substituents are on the same side or opposite? Or if the structure is such that it's a meso compound. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So methyl ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is OCH3-C-OH-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, I think it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

       O
       ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl. So in this case, the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's connected to other different groups. Let me see: the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) has which groups attached?

Assuming the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, the carbon with OH is connected to:

- CH3 (methyl group)
- COOCH3 (carboxy methyl ester)
- and two other groups? Wait no, wait, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate would be a three-carbon chain. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, that's 1-hydroxypropanoic acid? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

Wait, the correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would mean the OH is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because propanoate is from propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but with an OH on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But wait, the carbons are numbered as 1, 2, 3. So in propanoate, the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. So 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the molecule would have the structure where the central carbon (carbon 2) has CH2 groups on either side. Wait, but for a chiral center, we need four different groups attached. Let's see: Carbon 2 would be connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1, CH2)
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3)
- OH
- and another CH2? Wait, no. Wait, carbon 2 would have:

- CH3 (from carbon 1: the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 2 would be the central carbon with groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH3? Wait, that can't be right because then it would have two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me sketch it mentally. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- (so the chain is CH2-CH2-COO- but that can't be right because that's a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but that's three carbons: C1, C2, C3. So C1 is COO-, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH3. Wait, no, for propanoic acid, it's CH3CH2COOH. So the structure is:

C1: COOH
C2: CH2
C3: CH3

So the ester, methyl propanoate, would be CH3CH2COOCH3.

If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the OH is on C2. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central C (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from C3)
- COOCH3 (from C1)
- OH
- and another CH2 group (from C1, but wait, maybe that's not correct).

Wait, actually, the structure is:

C1: COOCH3
C2: CH(OH)
C3: CH3

So C2 is connected to:

- C1 (which is COOCH3)
- C3 (CH3)
- OH
- and another group? Wait, C2 is connected to two CH3 groups? No, because C2 is connected to C1 (COOCH3), C3 (CH3), and the OH. So wait, if C2 is CH(OH), then it's connected to:

- COOCH3 (from C1)
- CH3 (from C3)
- OH
- and another CH2 group? Or is the other group a hydrogen? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the C2 would have:

- CH3 (C3)
- COOCH3 (C1)
- OH
- and a hydrogen attached? Because CH would have four bonds. So C2 is CH(OH), which is connected to:

- C1 (COOCH3)
- C3 (CH3)
- OH
- H

So the four substituents are: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. Are all four different? COOCH3, CH3, OH, H. H is different from the others? Because H is unique. So yes, all four substituents are different. That makes C2 a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 can have optical isomers. So that's a yes.

3. Benzophenone. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. So, it's (Ph)2CO. Benzophenone is symmetrical. The central carbon is a carbonyl group, which is double-bonded to O. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Because both benzene rings are the same, and the central C is double-bonded to O. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it cannot have optical isomers because it doesn't have a chiral center and isn't a meso compound. So, compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid, and fumarate would be the di-ester. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3
O
||

Wait, more accurately, fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is cis, but fumarate is trans. So, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

Phthalic anhydride is similar, but fumarate is the trans version. So the structure is O=C-(CH2CH2)-C=O, but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, where the two COOH groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the di-ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So the structure is 2,3-dimethyl fumarate? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: fumarate is the diepoxide form, no, wait. No, fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid.

Wait, maleic acid is HO2CCHCHCO2H, with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), while fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So fumarate ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

So the double bond is between the two carbons, each attached to an ester group (O-CO-OCH3). Now, in terms of stereoisomerism, fumarate can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but does it have optical isomerism?

Wait, but let's check if it has a chiral center. No, because each ester group is attached to a carbon that's part of the double bond. So each of those carbons (the ones attached to the esters) is connected to two OCH3 groups and two double bonds. Wait, no, each of those carbons is connected to:

- One OCH3 (from the ester)
- One OCOOCH3 (wait, no, the ester is OCOOCH3. Each of the two central carbons is bonded to an OCOOCH3 group and a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

So each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has the same groups attached: each has an OCOOCH3 group and is double-bonded to the other. So both are identical, right? So each of those carbons is connected to:

- OCOOCH3
- Double bond to the other carbon.

But wait, what about the other substituents? Wait, each of these carbons is tetrahedral if considering the double bond as a part of the structure, but the double bond restricts rotation. So the question is: does each of these carbons have four different groups attached?

Each central carbon is attached to:

- OCOOCH3
- The other central carbon via double bond
- And two hydrogen atoms?

Wait, no, because fumarate is made from maleic acid, which is HO2CCHCHCO2H. So the structure is HOOC-CHCH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes OCOOCH3-CHCH-OCOOCH3. So the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3? No, wait, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of double bonds. Fumarate has a trans double bond. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the structure is:

OCOOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
OCOOCH3

But each of the carbons in the double bond would have:

- OCOOCH3
- Double bond to the other C
- And two H's?

Wait, no, in fumarate, each of the two central carbons is connected to an ester group and a double bond. So each has one ester group, two H's, and the double bond. So each has two H's, one ester, and the double bond. So each carbon would have two H's, one OCOOCH3, and two bonds from the double bond. So the groups are: OCOOCH3, H, H, and double bond (so as part of the structure, not a substituent). So each of these carbons is attached to two H's, one OCOOCH3, and is part of the double bond. So each carbon has two H's—so that's not four different groups. Therefore, there are no chiral centers here. 

Wait, but wait, in the case of fumarate ester, are there any chiral centers? No, because each of the central carbons has two H's attached. So no chiral centers. Therefore, can't have optical isomerism. But wait, dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer, but does it have stereoisomerism in terms of optical activity?

Wait, another possibility: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For dimethyl fumarate, since the substituents are on opposite sides (trans), does that make it a meso compound? No, because a meso compound has at least two chiral centers but a plane of symmetry. But here, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, just a double bond with E geometry. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. If the substituents on the double bond are different, then the molecule can have E/Z isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about chiral centers or planar chirality. Since dimethyl fumarate has a double bond but no chiral centers, it can't have optical isomers. So, does that mean that compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism?

Wait, but wait, I've heard that some compounds with double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but that's a different type of stereoisomerism, not optical. Therefore, without a chiral center, they don't exhibit optical isomerism. So, for dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans di-ester, it's a single stereoisomer but not an optical isomer. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I recall that some di-esters can have optical isomerism if they have a chiral center. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me reevaluate.

Let me think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. Its structure is OCOOCH2CH2OCOOCH2? No, wait, no. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

Wait, perhaps I should see if there's a chiral center. Each central carbon (the ones in the double bond) has two substituents: one OCOOCH3 group and two H's. So, each has two H's, which means they can't be chiral centers because they have two identical substituents. So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought. If the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, it's the trans (E) isomer. But since there's no chiral center, the molecule can't have enantiomers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and therefore can have optical isomerism. So that's a yes.

So, which of the options have compounds that show optical isomerism?

From the four, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. The others don't.

Wait, but wait what about compound 1? I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

Looking back at compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless there's a substituent causing a chiral center or a plane of symmetry, the molecule might have optical isomers.

The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each benzene ring, as well as 6 and 6' positions on each ring. Wait, in biphenyls, the positions are on each benzene. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, if the substituents on each benzene are symmetrical, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, for the molecule to be chiral, the substituents should be arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Let me think about whether the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule is chiral.

In dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (OCH3) at position 2. So, on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions.

In a biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected by a single bond. So, the relative positions of substituents on each ring can lead to different conformations. But whether the molecule is chiral depends on whether there's a plane of symmetry.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has the ester group at position 2 and the nitro group at 6. So, on each ring, substituents are at opposite positions (2 and 6 are across from each other in a benzene ring). So, each ring has two substituents opposite each other. Now, looking at the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected at position 1, meaning that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 relative to that point.

If the two rings have their substituents arranged such that the overall molecule is symmetric, then it would not be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, both rings have the same substituents at the same positions. So, the substituents on each ring are the same, and the arrangement is symmetric. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: No optical isomerism.
Compound 2: Yes, has a chiral center.
Compound 3: No, symmetric.
Compound 4: No, no chiral centers.

Looking at the options, which compounds show optical isomerism? Only compound 2.

Wait, but the options are given as A, B, C, D.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1,2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. So which option includes only 2? Looking at the options:

Option A includes 1,2,4.
Option D includes 1 and 2.

But since only 2 is correct, that would mean none of the options have only 2. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated compound 4. Let me think about dimethyl fumarate again. Maybe it's a meso compound, which would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility. If the substituents on the double bond are identical on each carbon, then the molecule could be a meso compound. But in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has an OCOOCH3 group and two H's. So, each is identical. So, the molecule is symmetric, hence not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: dimethyl maleate has cis configuration, leading to a chiral center, but no, wait, maleate is the cis isomer. If the substituents are on the same side, then each carbon would have two different substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in dimethyl maleate, which is the cis isomer, the structure would be OCOOCH3 on the same side. So, each of the central carbons would have groups arranged such that they're both attached to the same side. But in that case, each central carbon has:

- OCOOCH3
- H
- H
- double bond.

So, same as before; no chiral centers.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about compound 4. Could dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers?

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

Each of the C=C carbons has OCOOCH3, two H's, and the double bond. So, each has two H's—so no four different groups. Therefore, no chiral centers.

So, in that case, compounds 1,3,4 don't exhibit optical isomerism. Only compound 2 does. So, which option is correct?

Looking back at the options:

A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1 and 2

Wait, the only option that includes 2 and excludes the others is not present. The options don't have a choice that includes just 2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in my analysis?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try to draw it. Fumarate is the trans-diepoxide? No, fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

Each C=C carbon is attached to one OCOOCH3 group and two H's. So, each has substituents: OCOOCH3, H, H, and the double bond. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm. So, this leads me back to only compound 2 showing optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking at the options provided, which one includes 2? Let's see:

Option A: 1,2,4 → includes 2 but 1 and 4 don't.
Option D: 1 and 2 → includes 2 and 1. But I thought 1 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me re-examine.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, each ring has substituents opposite each other. So, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6.

Now, imagine the biphenyl: two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each has nitro at 6 and ester at 2.

If the substituents on both rings are arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetric, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if the biphenyl has two substituents on each ring, arranged symmetrically, then the molecule as a whole might be symmetric. But if the substituents can rotate to make the molecule asymmetric, which depends on the substituents' positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the overall molecule is a mirror image of itself.

In this case, because each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the original conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options:

The options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analysis.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Could dimethyl fumarate have any kind of stereocenter? No, because each C is attached to two H's, so no.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ester groups are on the same carbon. No, I think in dimethyl fumarate, each ester is on a separate carbon, connected by the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Now I'm a bit confused because I thought only compound 2 showed optical isomerism, but none of the options have that.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4
B)3,4
C)2,3
D)1 and 2

The question is which compounds show optical isomerism. So, if only compound 2 does, the correct answer would have to be an option that includes 2 and excludes the others. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine compound 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. The structure is O=C-OCH3 and O=C-OCH3 on either end of a double bond. So, the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3? No, no. Wait, no, fumarate is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH esterified to OCH3. No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is OCOOCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3? No, wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. So the structure is OCOOCH3-CH=CH-OCOOCH3, with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but each of the CH groups in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3 group. So, each CH has:

- OCOOCH3
- Double bond to another CH
- And two H's.

So, each of the CH groups has two H's attached. Therefore, each has two identical substituents, so no chiral centers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Since only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, perhaps in compound 1, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. Let me think.

If each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2, would that create a chiral center? No, because each benzene ring's substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So the biphenyl molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral.

Wait, but perhaps the way the substituents are arranged around the biphenyl axis can lead to chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but if each ring has substituents across from each other (2 and 6), then the entire molecule would have a center of symmetry. Because for each substituent on one ring, there's a corresponding substituent on the other ring in the opposite direction. So, the molecule would be achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, this brings me back to the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options have only 2, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look:

Options:

A) 1,2,4
B)3 and4
C)2 and3
D)1 and2

Wait, I thought that only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of another compound.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate actually has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of compound 4. Let me think about the structure again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
     C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
||
O

Each of the C=C carbons has an OCOOCH3 group and two H's. So each has two H's. Therefore, no chiral centers.

Wait, but what if the substituents are in a different arrangement? For example, perhaps each of the C=C carbons is connected to two different groups.

Wait, no, each is connected to an OCOOCH3 group and two H's. So, each has two H's—same substituents.

So, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps another compound also has optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Could it have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a trans configuration across the double bond. So, each ester group is on opposite sides. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric along the axis of the double bond. Therefore, it's achiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility arises: the molecule could have a center of symmetry. For example, if you rotate 180 degrees around the double bond, the substituents swap places. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.

So, I'm confident now that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of another compound.

Wait, let me go back to compound 4. Perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Maybe the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-configured, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. But that doesn't create any chiral centers, as each ester group is on a CH2 group.

Wait, no, in fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each attached to an ester group.

Another thought: what about if the substituents are on the same side? That would be the cis configuration, which is maleate. But fumarate is trans.

Wait, but regardless of cis or trans, each carbon in the double bond has two H's and an ester group, so no chiral centers.

Hmm. So, I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2.

Wait, perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism, but the question specifies optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think about it again.

Wait, another approach: which of the options are correct?

Looking at the options, option A says 1,2,4 show optical isomerism. But I don't think so.

Option D says 1 and 2. But if compound 1 doesn't show it, then D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another line of thought: which compounds can have stereocenters?

Compound 2 has a stereocenter. So that's correct.

Compounds 1 and 4 do not have stereocenters, so they don't show optical isomerism.

Compound 3 is symmetric, so no.

So, only compound 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: perhaps the molecule can have a chiral center elsewhere. For example, maybe the ester groups are attached to a chiral center. No, because in dimethyl fumarate, each ester is attached to a carbon in the double bond, which is connected to two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is actually a cis di-ester, making it a meso compound. For example, if the two ester groups are on the same side, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But in that case, the molecule would be meso, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is a meso compound, then it's achiral. So, regardless of cis or trans, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2. But looking back at the options, I don't see an option that includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps the question allows for other possibilities. Let me think again about compound 4.

Wait, another possibility: dimethyl fumarate is an E di-ester, but its structure could lead to a situation where it's a meso compound, which has no optical activity. So, no optical isomerism.

So, if I'm correct, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the available options don't include an option with only 2. So, perhaps the correct option is option A, which includes 2, but also 1 and 4.

But I think that's incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, perhaps in compound 1, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is chiral. Let me imagine the structure.

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So, in the biphenyl, each ring is connected at position 1. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement of substituents around the biphenyl axis makes the molecule chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other, then the molecule might be symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not in the same plane, leading to chirality.

But without a clear chiral center, it's hard to say. Maybe the molecule is a chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the biphenyl. For example, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a non-superimposable way.

Wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless there's a rigid structure, it's hard to have a chiral center. But without a chiral center, the molecule can't be chiral.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, thus making it chiral without any chiral centers. That's called a chiral molecule without chiral centers, which is possible via a phenomenon called "spatial isomerism" or "asymmetric centers without a single chiral center." For example, in some cases like certain biphenyls, the molecule can be chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the central bond.

Ah, so perhaps that's the case here. So, the molecule could be chiral due to the spatial arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl rings, even without any chiral centers.

In that case, compound 1 might exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but how? Let me think.

For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has nitro and ester groups at 2 and 6. So, each ring has substituents across from each other. Now, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

For example, suppose that on each ring, the nitro group is in a certain position relative to the connecting bond. If the arrangement of substituents on each ring leads to an overall lack of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that they mirror each other across the biphenyl axis, then the molecule would be achiral. But if they're not, then it's chiral.

So, in this compound, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Since in a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (the connecting point), and position 6 is opposite position 2. So, each ring has nitro at 6 (opposite to position 2, which is where the ester is).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral environment when considering the entire molecule.

For example, if the substituent positions lead to the molecule being unable to superimpose on its mirror image, it would be chiral.

If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it can have optical isomers.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to say. But in general, biphenyls with substituents in the 2 and 6 positions are often achiral because of the symmetry.

Alternatively, some biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has nitro and ester groups at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So, each ring is identical in substituent positions, leading to a symmetric arrangement. Therefore, the molecule as a whole is symmetric, making it achiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the possible options:

Option A: 1, 2,4 → includes 2 but also 1 and 4, which I think don't.
Option D: 1 and 2 → includes 2 but 1 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about whether the compounds can exhibit any form of stereoisomerism, including geometric, not just optical isomerism. But the question specifically asks about optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: each benzene has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, each ring has two substituents opposite each other.

If the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetric, it's achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral. But without more information, it's hard to say. But I think in this case, it's symmetric.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → has a chiral center → yes.

3. benzophenone → symmetric → no.

4. dimethyl fumarate → no chiral centers → no.

So, only compound 2.

But the options don't include an option with only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is a meso compound. For example, if the substituents on each side are mirror images, making the molecule achiral. But since each substituent is an ester group, which is the same on both ends, the molecule would be symmetric, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, even without a chiral center, a molecule can exhibit optical activity due to other factors, but I think that's not common.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of another compound.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has an E configuration. But E and Z are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. Therefore, the E configuration doesn't imply optical isomerism. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the correct answer must be only compound 2. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Maybe it's chiral. Let me think again.

In biphenyl compounds, a 2,2',6,6' substitution could lead to a chiral molecule if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. For example, if the substituents are in such a way that they create a chiral axis or a chiral center.

Wait, but each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl axis is a line of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm stuck. According to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a different structure. For example, perhaps the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is OCOOCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3? No, no, wait, that's not correct. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid's di-ester. So the structure should be OCOOCH3 on each end of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OCOOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOOCH3, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. So, that's not correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   Each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The biphenyl structure connects the two rings at position 1. The substituents on each ring are symmetrical (opposite each other), and the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon at position 2 (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a **chiral center**, allowing the molecule to exist as enantiomers. Thus, it exhibits **optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two benzene rings are connected by a ketone group. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) di-ester of maleic acid, with the structure OCOOCH₃-CH=CH-OCOOCH₃. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to an OCOOCH₃ group and two hydrogens. Since each carbon has two identical substituents (H), there are no chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule is symmetric, so it does not exhibit **optical isomerism**.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds analyzed show optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the reasoning, the closest answer would be **Option A (1, 2, 4)**, but this includes compounds 1 and 4, which do not exhibit optical isomerism.
