Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with specific constructs and then testing its expression in mice. The problem is that when they look under the confocal microscope, they don't see a green signal. I need to figure out why.

Let me break down the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under the same promoter. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. So, I think the promoter would drive both ORFs, but the IRES allows internal ribosome entry for the receptor, meaning the receptor could be expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I'm a bit fuzzy on the loxP system. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination. So, if Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed because the stop would be removed. Same for the receptor and eGFP.

They used SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. I think SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells. When they cross the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would activate in those cells, leading to recombination and removal of the stop cassettes. So, ligand and mCherry should be expressed, and receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But in the confocal, they don't see green. So, eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression, not function. So I don't think this affects the Western blot or GFP expression. The question is about why eGFP isn't showing up.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the construct is stuck, it wouldn't reach the cell surface. But why would that happen? The vector design seems normal. Also, the question is about the expression in the mice. They used primary astrocytes for the initial test, but maybe the receptor is not properly trafficked. But the question says they did a Western blot, so maybe that would show the protein is present even if stuck. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw a signal proportional to actin. So if the proteins are expressed, the Western should show bands. But if the eGFP isn't showing up, maybe it's not expressed.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. But the vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor. If the enhancer was missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the setup said they had antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them on Western blot after transfection. If the enhancer was missing, they wouldn't have seen expression in the blot either. But the question says they transfected into primary astrocytes, so maybe the promoter is active in those cells. So maybe this isn't the issue.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the vector is constructed with the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. If the two are not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion protein. Also, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre is present (like in the offspring), the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But if the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP might not be made correctly. So the protein would be produced as the receptor, and maybe a small part of eGFP, but not the full functional GFP. So when they look for eGFP on Western, maybe it's not detected because it's not properly tagged or not expressed as a fusion.

Wait, but the question is about fluorescent signal under the confocal. If the eGFP is not properly expressed, then they wouldn't see green. So maybe D is the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the expression construct for the receptor-eGFP isn't correctly spliced. Let me think about the vector setup. The vector is bicistronic: Ligand (CBA promoter) - stop cassette (loxP) - mCherry; then IRES, then receptor, then stop cassette (lox2272) - eGFP.

Wait, no, the vector is ligand ORF at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So the ligand is first, then after the stop, mCherry. Then the IRES comes after the ligand, allowing the receptor to be translated. So the construct is probably something like: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry; IRES -> receptor ORF -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

Wait, that can't be right. Bicistronic vectors typically have two ORFs separated by
