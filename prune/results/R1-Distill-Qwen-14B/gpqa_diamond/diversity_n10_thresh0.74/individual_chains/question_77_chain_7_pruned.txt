Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question asks about the major products formed in two different reactions involving the Cope rearrangement. Let's break it down.

First, the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. Hmm. BuLi is a strong base, so I remember that it's often used to deprotonate compounds, especially in enolate formation or conjugate additions. But wait, the starting material here is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo alkylation or elimination reactions when treated with strong bases.

Wait, the molecule is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that. So, the benzene ring has a substituent that's a methylene group (OCH₂CH₂... no, wait. The structure is OCH₂-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3), maybe? Because 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-, but with a methyl at position 3. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-; but with a methyl on the third carbon, it's CH₂=CHCH(CH3). So the substituent is OCH₂CH₂-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Wait, no. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group. So it's OCH₂- attached to the benzene, and the oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-O-CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂?
