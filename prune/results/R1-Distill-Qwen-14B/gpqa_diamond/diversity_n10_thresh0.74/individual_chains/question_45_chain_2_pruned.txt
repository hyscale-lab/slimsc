Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that particles in a 1D well have quantized energy levels. Each level is given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? Oh wait, the question says E is equal to that expression, so E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy state would be E times n squared.

But wait, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, right, that means they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two particles can occupy the same quantum state, which includes both the spatial part and the spin part. So each spatial state can have up to two particles with opposite spins.

The system is four particles, so I need to find how they fill up the energy levels.

The question asks for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies. Let me think about the possible configurations.

In the ground state, all particles should be in the lowest possible energy levels. Since each spatial state can hold two particles (spin up and down), the first level (n=1) can hold two, the second level (n=2) can hold two, and so on.

So for four particles, the ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2. Let me calculate the total energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²)=E. Two particles make 2E. Similarly, two in n=2 contribute E*(2²)*2 = 4E * 2? Wait, no, each n=2 particle is 4E, so two of them make 8E. Wait, wait, no. For each particle, the energy is E*(n²). So particle 1 and 2 in n=1 each contribute E, so total 2E. Particles 3 and 4 in n=2 each contribute 4E, so their total is 8E. So overall, ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E?

Wait, wait. No, wait. The first two particles go into n=1 with spin up and down. The next two have to go into the next available state, which is n=2, each with spin up and down. So their energies are 1²E and
