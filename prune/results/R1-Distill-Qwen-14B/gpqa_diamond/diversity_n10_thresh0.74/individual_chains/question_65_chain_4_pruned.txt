Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B based on the given options.

The first reaction is: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. So, what does this reaction do?

The compound is a spiro compound, which means two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me try to imagine the structure. The spiro part is between a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro atom, which is also an alcohol group (since it's -ol). The double bond is in the five-membered ring at position 5.

Wait, spiro[3.5]non... So the total carbons are 3 + 5 + the shared one (since spiro compounds have two rings sharing a single atom). So 3 + 5 + 1 = 9, but the name is non, which is 9 carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Spiro compounds have the formula Rn+1, where n is the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non would have 3+5+1=9? No, wait, the total number would be 3+5=8, plus the shared one makes 9, so non is correct.

So the structure has a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane but with substituents) and a five-membered ring connected at one carbon. The 1 position is where the vinyl group is attached, which is also the alcohol. So, the OH is on that same carbon as the vinyl group.

Now, when this reacts with KH in THF. Potassium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But what's happening here? Maybe elimination? Because the starting material has a hydroxyl group and a double bond nearby. So perhaps it's an E2 elimination.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like KH, the -OH could be deprotonated. But wait, the OH is on a carbon adjacent to a double bond. So maybe it's a situation where a conjugate base is formed, leading to an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, the base could deprotonate
