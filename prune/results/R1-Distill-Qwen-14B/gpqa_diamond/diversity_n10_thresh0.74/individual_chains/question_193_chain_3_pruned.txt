Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) equals 1 divided by distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. 

Wait, how does that relate to the number of stars? So more stars would be found either closer or farther, depending on how the numbers work out. Let me think about the relation between number of stars (N) and distance (r). The question is asking how N changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance, or the density as a function of distance.

Let me write down what I know. Parallax (plx) is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So if I have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx gives me N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, so N increases as d^5? That feels really high, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but wait. Number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, but wait, in reality, the number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Volume increases with d^3. But this seems to be a different setup because the problem is giving a specific variation with parallax.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies inversely with plx^5. So N = k * (1/(plx)^5 ). But parallax is 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So plug that in: N = k * (d^5). So N is proportional to d^5. So when d increases, N increases a lot, like d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so perhaps it's the number density or the change in number as you move a small distance dr. Let me think about it. Alternatively, maybe the number of
