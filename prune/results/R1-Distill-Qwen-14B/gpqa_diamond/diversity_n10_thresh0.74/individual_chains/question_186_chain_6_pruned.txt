Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, specifically a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, where the sigma bond moves, and the molecule rearranges into a different structure. 

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? So the molecule has a norbornene ring with substituents. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

The main structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, which means there are two rings: a five-membered and a two-membered bridge, but wait, no, the bicyclo system has three bridges. Wait, bicyclo[m.n.p]ane has m, n, p as the number of carbons in each bridge. So [2.2.1] means the main ring is a 6-membered, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So the structure is a bridged bicyclic system with two two-carbon bridges and one one-carbon bridge.

The substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?) and an azabicyclo group. Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo... so the 2-position has both a vinyl group and an amino group? Or is it that the ring has an amino substituent and a vinyl substituent both at position 2? Hmm, maybe the 2-azabicyclo means that the nitrogen is part of the bicyclo ring. So the bicyclo system has a nitrogen at position 2. So, the structure would have a bridge where one of the bridge carbons is replaced by a nitrogen. So it's a bicyclic amine.

Wait, the structure is (1S,4R)-configuration. So perhaps the bicyclo has substituents at positions 1 and 4, which are stereogenic centers. Let me try to draw this mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a bridge between C1 and C4, perhaps. The double bond is at 5-ene, so position 5 and 6 are double bonded.

But perhaps it's easier to think of the norbornene structure. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, with a double bond. So in this case, substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group and an amino group (since it's 2-azabicyclo). So position 2 has substituents, and the double bond is at position 5.

Wait, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo has a nitrogen at position 2. The substituents might be a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) attached to position 2, along with the nitrogen.

So the molecule probably
