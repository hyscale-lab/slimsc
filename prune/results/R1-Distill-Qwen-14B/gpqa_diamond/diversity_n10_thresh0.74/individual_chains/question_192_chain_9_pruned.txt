Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor. It has a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere with a smaller sphere-shaped hole somewhere inside, not at the center because s is the distance between the centers.

Now, they place a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So what do I remember about conductors and electric fields? Well, when a conductor is neutral, any excess charge would be on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged. But there's a charge inside the cavity. 

Wait, I think the cavity is inside the conductor, right? So the conductor's material is in between the cavity and the outer surface. Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in such cases, the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge opposite to the charge inside the cavity. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface would have a charge equal in magnitude to the inner surface's charge but opposite sign. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, no. The conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. If there's a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material can't have a net charge, so the charges must redistribute. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance, because the conductor's total charge is zero. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

Wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is uncharged, the sum of all charges on the conductor (inner
