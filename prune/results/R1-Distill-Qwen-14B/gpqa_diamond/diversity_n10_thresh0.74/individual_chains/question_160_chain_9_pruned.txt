Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says it's an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. And the approximation tanθ ≈ θ is allowed since the angles are small.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So, the problem is essentially about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Oh, right! The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is described by the Bessel functions. The minima occur where the Bessel function of the first kind, J1, has zeros. The first minima would be at the first zero of J1.

But wait, I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum (the smallest angle where intensity drops to zero) is at an angle θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is approximately 3.8317, but wait, wait. No, wait, J1's first zero is around 3.83? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, wait, no: the first zero of J1 is about 3.83 radians, but for the minima in the diffraction pattern, it's the first zero of J1 divided by the radius times some factor. 

Wait, the diffraction formula for a circular aperture is I = I0 (J1( (π a sinθ)/λ ))^2 / ( (π a sinθ)/λ )^2. Or wait, maybe the argument is ( (2π a sinθ)/λ )? Wait, I might be getting the exact formula wrong. Let me think.

The general formula for the intensity in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture is given by the square of the zeroth order Bessel function divided by the square of the argument, or something like that. Or wait, maybe the intensity is proportional to J1^2
