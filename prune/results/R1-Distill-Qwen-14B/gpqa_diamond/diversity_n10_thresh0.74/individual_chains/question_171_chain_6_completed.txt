Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. I need to arrange these substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, weight fraction of the para-isomer... So, the percentage of the product that is the para-substituted bromide compared to all possible products.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the position where the substituent is added depends on the directing groups already present on the benzene ring. Activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, while deactivating groups do the opposite.

Wait, the substituents in each case are all attached to benzene. So each compound is a monosubstituted benzene. When they react with excess bromine, which is probably Br2, they undergo substitution. Since it's electrophilic, the Br+ would be the electrophile.

But wait, bromine is a di-electrophile, right? So under these conditions, the reaction would typically lead to di-substitution, but the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, wait, no. Wait the question says it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the reaction leads to monobromination, but sometimes, depending on the substituent, the para product is more or less favored.

Wait, but the problem is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So for each compound, when bromine adds to the ring, where does it go? The substituent directs the incoming Br. So the substituent in each compound is a directing group.

Let me list the substituents:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) Cl
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, wait, no. Let me check again:

1) C6H5-CH3 → benzyl methyl, so the substituent is -CH3 (methyl)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → substituent is -COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl)
3) C6H5-Cl → substituent is -Cl (chlorine)
4) C6H5-NO2 → substituent is -NO2 (nitro)
5) C6H5-C2H5 → substituent is -C2H5 (ethyl)
6) C6H5-COOH → substituent is -COOH (carboxylic acid group)

Now, each substituent is either activating or deactivating, and meta or para directing.

Let me recall the directing effects:

- Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -OH, alkyl groups) are ortho/para directors. They make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

- Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -X (halogens)) are meta directors. They deactivate the ring, making it less reactive, but still direct the incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to themselves.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the substituent in each case is attached to the benzene ring. So when Br adds, it's adding a second substituent, and the position depends on the directing effect of the existing substituent.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, like nitro or COOH, then the para position would be less favored compared to when the substituent is activating. So the para product's yield would be lower when the substituent is deactivating, perhaps?

Wait, but in the case of para directors, the incoming group goes to the para position, but in the case of meta directors, it goes to the meta. So the para product's weight fraction depends on whether the substituent is a para director or not.

Wait, but each compound here has only one substituent. So when the reaction occurs, the Br will enter either ortho, para, or meta relative to the existing substituent.

Wait, wait, no. Electrophilic substitution in benzene derivatives adds the incoming group (Br) to the ring. The existing substituent directs where the Br goes.

In a monosubstituted benzene, the positions available for substitution are ortho, meta, and para to the substituent.

So, for each substituent, the Br can add in positions that are ortho, meta, or para to it, depending on the substituent's directing effect.

Wait, but the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh wait, no. The problem says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed". So perhaps each reaction leads to only one product, but that's unlikely unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Or perhaps, given the reaction conditions, only one is formed predominantly.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that each substituent leads to a single position for substitution, so the product is either a single para product or a mixture, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer.

Wait, but the problem says: arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So we need to find for each substituent, when Br adds, what's the percentage of para product, and then arrange the compounds from smallest to largest para fraction.

Wait, so for each substituent, the bromine adds in a certain position (ortho, meta, para) and the percentage of para product depends on the substituent's directing effect and the possibility of multiple substitution positions.

Wait, but for some substituents, the ring may be so activated that the para position is favored, while for others, it's not.

Let me think about each substituent:

1) -CH3 (methyl): This is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when Br adds, it can go ortho, meta, or para. Wait, no. Wait, substituents that are ortho/para directors allow substitution in ortho and para positions. So the incoming Br would enter either ortho or para positions. But in the case of a single substituent, the possible positions are ortho (two positions), para (one position), and meta (three positions, but those would be meta to the substituent).

Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, each substituent has three possible positions for substitution: ortho (two positions), meta (two positions), and para (one position). Wait, no, for monosubstituted benzene, positions are numbered such that the substituent is at position 1, ortho is 2 and 6, meta is 3 and 5, and para is 4.

So, for a substituent that is activating and ortho/para-directing, the incoming electrophile is directed to positions 2,4,6. So, when Br adds, it's more likely to go to ortho or para.

But depending on the substituent's strength, the para position might be more favored than ortho. Or perhaps both are possible, but the para might have a higher yield.

Wait, but in the case of methyl, which is an activating group, the para product might be favored, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the para product is more favored when the substituent is bulky. Wait, but methyl is small.

Wait, maybe we need to look into the relative activation of the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the para product is the major product when the substituent is a strong activating group and allows para substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each substituent's directing effect and the major product when bromine is added.

1. -CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para director. So Br would substitute mainly in ortho and para positions. So the major products would be the ortho and para bromides. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for this substituent, the para product would be a major product, but how much exactly? Maybe the para is the major product, so a relatively high weight fraction.

2. -COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This is a deactivating group (since it's an electron-withdrawing group) and a meta director. So Br would substitute in the meta position relative to the substituent. So the major product would be the meta bromide. So the para product would be minimal, perhaps negligible. So the weight fraction of the para isomer would be very low, maybe lower than others.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the substituent is meta directing, the para would be less likely. So the para product's fraction would be lower. But wait, the substituent is COOEt, which is a meta director, so the Br would go to the meta positions. So the para position is not favored. So the para fraction is low.

3. -Cl (chlorine): Chlorine is a deactivating (due to its electronegativity) and ortho/para director. Wait, no. Wait, Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring less reactive. But it's an ortho/para director. So when Cl is present, the substituent directs the incoming Br to ortho and para positions. So for this substituent, the para product would be a major product. So the weight fraction of the para isomer is high.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me confirm: Chlorine is a deactivating group (because it's more electronegative than C, so it withdraws electrons via inductive effect), but it's an ortho/para director because of its ability to donate electrons via resonance (though the inductive effect is stronger). No, wait: actually, chlorine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. Because the inductive effect (electron-withdrawing) is stronger than the resonance effect (which is electron-donating). So overall, it's deactivating but still directs ortho and para.

So substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So bromine would substitute at ortho and para positions. So the para product would be a major fraction.

4. -NO2 (nitro): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the incoming Br would substitute in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So the para product would be minimal or absent. So the weight fraction of the para isomer is low.

5. -C2H5 (ethyl): This is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Similar to methyl, ethyl is an alkyl group which donates electrons via induction, activating the ring. So Br would substitute at ortho and para positions, leading to a significant para product.

6. -COOH (carboxylic acid): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. The COOH group is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. So the para product would be minimal.

Wait, but wait. Let me summarize each substituent's effect on the para product:

Substituent | Activating/Deactivating | Director (ortho/para/meta) | Para Product Fraction
--- | --- | --- | ---
1) CH3 | Activating | Ortho/para | High (para is a major product)
2) COOEt | Deactivating | Meta | Low (para is minor)
3) Cl | Deactivating (but ortho/para) | Ortho/para | High (para is a major product)
4) NO2 | Deactivating | Meta | Low (para is minor)
5) C2H5 | Activating | Ortho/para | High (para is a major product)
6) COOH | Deactivating | Meta | Low (para is minor)

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about substituent 3: Cl. Since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so the reaction might not proceed as easily. But for the purpose of the question, the substituent directs where the Br goes. So for Cl, since it's an ortho/para director, the para product would be formed, but because Cl is deactivating, the overall rate is slower. But the question is about the fraction of para isomer, not the overall yield.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the substituents that are more activating (like methyl and ethyl) will lead to higher fractions of para products, while those that are deactivating (like Cl, COOEt, NO2, COOH) will have lower fractions.

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para director. So the para product is formed, but perhaps the fraction is lower than the case for activating groups.

So, looking at the substituents 1 and 5 (CH3 and C2H5), which are activating and ortho/para directors. So their para fractions would be high.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para, so para product is also possible but perhaps the fraction is lower than 1 and 5.

Substituents 2,4,6 are all deactivating and meta directors. So their para fractions would be very low.

Wait, but wait: substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para director but deactivating. So the para product would be formed, but how does its fraction compare to substituents 1 and 5?

Wait, but the activating groups (1 and 5) have a stronger activating effect than Cl, which is a deactivating but ortho/para. So perhaps the para product's fraction is higher for 1 and 5 than for 3.

So the order of para fractions from lowest to highest (increasing) would be:

Lowest: substituents that are meta directors → their para fractions are low.

Among meta directors, substituents 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH) all are meta directors. So their para fractions are low, but perhaps in different orders.

Wait, but how do their para fractions compare? For substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not the major product, so the fraction is low.

Wait, but substituents 3 (Cl) is ortho/para but deactivating. So for substituent 3, the para product is possible but perhaps not as much as for activating groups.

Let me think about each substituent's para fraction:

1) CH3 → high para fraction (activating, ortho/para)
2) COOEt → low (meta)
3) Cl → high (but lower than activating, since deactivating)
4) NO2 → low (meta)
5) C2H5 → high (activating, ortho/para)
6) COOH → low (meta)

Wait, but substituents 1 and 5 are both activating, so their para fractions are high. Among them, which has a higher fraction? Maybe they are similar, but perhaps the more activating group leads to a higher para fraction.

Methyl and ethyl are both activating. Methyl is a weaker activating group than ethyl, or vice versa? Wait, no. Alkyl groups are all activating. The more the electron-donating, the more activating. So ethyl is larger than methyl, but both are similar in their activating effects. So their para fractions might be similar.

Wait, but what about substituent 3, Cl? It's deactivating, but ortho/para. So the para product would form, but perhaps less than the activating groups.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

Lowest: substituents where para is not favored (meta directors) → their para fractions are low and perhaps in the order of how much they deactivate.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para product. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para product isn't formed much, so their fractions are low. For substituents that are ortho/para directors (activating or deactivating), the para product can form, and the fraction depends on how much the substituent directs.

So let's try to rank all substituents based on the weight fraction of the para product.

Substituents:

1) CH3: high
2) COOEt: low
3) Cl: high
4) NO2: low
5) C2H5: high
6) COOH: low

Wait, but what's the order of para fractions among 2,4,6? All are meta directors. Their para fractions are low. Perhaps the order is based on how deactivating they are. Wait, perhaps the more deactivating the group, the less reactive the ring, so less para product?

Wait, no, because the question is about the fraction, not the rate. For substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not a major product, but their fraction depends on the directing.

Wait, maybe substituents that are meta directors have very low para fractions. For example, substituents 2,4,6 would have almost no para product, so their fractions are low. But substituent 3 (Cl) is ortho/para, so has a higher para fraction, but lower than the activating groups.

So, the substituents can be grouped into two categories: meta directors (low para fractions) and ortho/para directors (higher para fractions, especially activating).

Now, within the ortho/para director group, which substituents have higher para fractions? The activating groups (1 and 5) would have higher para fractions than the deactivating ones (like Cl, 3). Because activating groups make the ring more reactive, but for the purpose of this question, it's about the fraction of para isomer, not the rate.

Wait, but for substituents that are activating, the para product is a major product. So substituents 1 and 5 have high para fractions. Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para, so its para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5 but higher than the meta directors.

So the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) → Cl (3) → activating groups (1,5)

Wait, but the para fractions for 2,4,6 are all low, but how low? Are they the same? Or is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps substituents with stronger electron-withdrawing effects (like NO2 and COOH) have lower reactivity, leading to lower yields, but the question is about the fraction of para, not the overall yield.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents that are meta directors don't produce any para product because the Br adds at meta. So their para fractions are zero.

But that can't be, because in reality, even meta directors can sometimes give some ortho and para products, but they are minor.

Wait, no. For meta directors, the major product is meta, but minor products can be ortho and para. So, the para product's fraction is small but not zero.

But for the purpose of this question, perhaps we can assume that substituents that are meta directors don't produce any para product, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps for all meta directors, the para product's fraction is low, but the exact order depends on the substituent's directing strength.

Perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is a stronger meta director than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's ability to direct. For deactivating, meta directors, the para product is less favored. So substituents 2,4,6 would have the lowest para fractions. Among them, perhaps substituent 6 (COOH) is the strongest deactivating, so the para fraction is the lowest. Then substituent 4 (NO2) is next, and substituent 2 (COOEt) perhaps higher than them.

Wait, but COOEt is an ester group, which is deactivating (electron-withdrawing) but not as strong as nitro or COOH groups.

So from strongest to weakest deactivating: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

Therefore, in terms of directing, the strongest deactivating groups would have the least para product. So substituent 4 (NO2) would have a lower para fraction than substituent 6 (COOH), which in turn lower than substituent 2 (COOEt? No, wait. Wait, perhaps the opposite: the stronger the deactivating group, the less likely the ring is to react, but the question is about the fraction of para isomer, not the reaction rate.

Wait, perhaps the substituents which are meta directors direct the Br to meta positions almost exclusively. So the para fraction would be negligible, but perhaps the order of their para fractions is based on the substituent's ability to deactivate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to list the substituents and the expected para fraction:

1) CH3: high (paraxylylene is the main product)
2) COOEt: low (para product is minor)
3) Cl: medium (since it's deactivating but ortho/para)
4) NO2: low (para product is minor)
5) C2H5: high (similar to CH3)
6) COOH: low (para product is minor)

So, to arrange these substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

We have the lowest para fractions in substituents 2,4,6, then substituent 3, then 1 and 5.

Within 2,4,6: substituent 6 (COOH) is the strongest deactivating, so perhaps the para fraction is the lowest. Then substituent 4 (NO2) next, then substituent 2 (COOEt) highest among them.

So the order would be: substituent 6 (COOH) < substituent 4 (NO2) < substituent 2 (COOEt) < substituent 3 (Cl) < substituents 1 and 5 (CH3 and C2H5). But between 1 and 5, perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3), or vice versa.

Wait, but methyl and ethyl are both activating groups. I think the larger alkyl groups may have more steric hindrance, leading to para product being favored. So substituent 5 (C2H5) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3). Or perhaps the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para fraction. But both are activating, so their para fractions are similar, but perhaps substituent 5 (ethyl) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the larger substituent (ethyl) is more bulky, so the ortho positions are less favored due to steric hindrance, making para the major product. So substituent 5 might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

6 < 4 < 2 < 3 < 1 <5 ?

But wait, no. Let me check again. Wait, substituent 2 is COOEt, a meta director. So its para fraction is low. Substituent 4 is NO2, meta director, so low. Substituent 6 is COOH, meta director, low.

So, in terms of para fractions, substituents 2,4,6 are lower than 3, which is Cl (ortho/para), which is lower than 1, CH3, and 5, C2H5.

Wait, but the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction. So from the smallest to the largest.

So the substituents with the lowest para fractions are 2,4,6, followed by 3, then 1 and 5.

So, the order:

6 (COOH) < 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOEt) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order among 2,4,6. Earlier I thought 6 (COOH) has the lowest para fraction, followed by 4 (NO2), then 2 (COOEt).

So 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I got the order of substituents 2,4,6 wrong. Maybe substituent 2 (COOEt) is weaker deactivating than 6 (COOH) and 4 (NO2).

So substituent 2 has a higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

So the order would be:

6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 6 is after 2.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, 2 is in the middle.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Wait, none of the options match 6<4<2<3<1<5.

Wait, perhaps I should review each substituent.

Wait, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a strong deactivating meta director. So the para product's fraction is very low.

Substituent 4 is NO2, another strong deactivating meta director. So para fraction is also very low.

Substituent 2 is COOEt (ester), which is deactivating (electron-withdrawing) but a meta director. Its para fraction is also low, but perhaps higher than 4 and 6.

Wait, so substituents 4 and 6 are stronger deactivators than 2. So their para fractions are lower than 2.

So the order among meta directors: 6 <4 <2.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para, so its para fraction is higher than all meta directors but lower than activating groups.

So the order would be:

6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Hmm, I don't see this exact order in the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 6 should be lower than 4 and 2.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No, because 4 is after 2, but 4 is lower than 2.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituents 2,4,6.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 (COOEt) is more deactivating than substituent 6 (COOH). Because the ester group (COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, but the carboxylic acid (COOH) is even more so. So substituent 6 would be more deactivating than 2, leading to a lower para fraction.

Thus, among meta directors, the order would be: 6 (COOH) < 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOEt).

So the overall order is 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Wait, none of the options match. Did I make a mistake in the substituent assessment?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that substituent 2 (COOEt) is a stronger deactivator than 6 (COOH). No, that's not correct. The COOH group is a stronger deactivator than COOEt because it's more electronegative and has a stronger -I effect.

So substituent 6 (COOH) is more deactivating than 2, so its para fraction is lower. So the order among meta directors is 6 <4 <2.

Thus, the overall order is 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options again, the only option that has 4 before 2 is option A, but option A starts with 4<2<6<3... which isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer.

For meta directors, the para product is a minor product. For substituents that are meta directors, the para fraction would be very low, but perhaps in the order of 2 <4 <6, meaning substituent 2 has a higher para fraction than 4 and 6.

Wait, but that might not make sense because stronger deactivators would have lower reactivity, but the fraction of para might be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' strength as deactivators affects the para fraction inversely. So the stronger the deactivator, the lower the para fraction.

So substituent 6 (COOH) is stronger deactivating than 2 (COOEt) which is stronger than 4 (NO2? No, wait, NO2 is a stronger deactivator than COOH.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me check the relative strengths of deactivating groups.

The order of deactivating (electron-withdrawing) groups (from strongest to weakest) is generally:

NO2 > CN > COOH > COOR (like COOEt) > F > Cl > etc.

Wait, so substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivator, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So substituent 4 is the strongest deactivator, so its para fraction would be the lowest among the meta directors.

Substituent 6 is next, then substituent 2.

So order among meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para, so its para fraction is higher than all meta directors but lower than activating groups.

Then, activating groups 1 and 5: their para fractions are high.

Between 1 and 5, which one has a higher para fraction? Both are activating, but perhaps the larger substituent (C2H5) leads to more para product because the ortho positions are hindered.

So the order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, which option reflects this order?

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, because 3 comes after 1.

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No, because 6 is after 2.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4 → No.

Wait, none of the options match this. Let me look back.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this order in the options, none match.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the substituent's ability to deactivate the ring and the steric effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the para isomer's fraction is influenced by the substituent's ability to activate the ring. So, the more activating, the higher the para fraction.

Substituents 1 and 5 are activating, so their para fractions are highest.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating but ortho/para, so its para fraction is lower than 1 and 5 but higher than meta directors.

Substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are low. Among them, substituent 4 (NO2) is the strongest deactivator, so its para fraction is lowest, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So the order of increasing para fraction is:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking again, none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 have their para fractions in the order 2 <4 <6, meaning substituent 2 has the lowest para fraction among meta directors.

Wait, that would mean substituent 2 (COOEt) has a lower para fraction than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). That seems unlikely because NO2 is a stronger deactivator.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 2 <6 <4 <3 <1 <5.

But I'm not confident. Maybe looking for another approach.

Another approach: the more activating the substituent, the higher the para fraction.

So:

1 and 5 are activating → high para.

3 is deactivating but ortho/para → lower than 1,5 but higher than meta directors.

2,4,6 are meta directors → low para.

So among 2,4,6, the order of para fractions would be the same as their deactivating strength. So 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt).

So overall order:4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, this matches option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No, because option C has 1 after 2 and before 5, but in my order, 3 comes after 2.

Wait, the options are:

Option C)4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So 4 comes first, then 6, then 2, then 1, then 5, then 3.

But in my order, it's 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So option C ends with 3, but I have 3 before 1 and 5.

So perhaps I'm wrong, and substituent 3's para fraction is higher than substituents 1 and 5.

Wait, substituent 3 is Cl, which is a deactivating group but ortho/para. So its para product would be present, but less than activating groups.

So substituent 3's para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5.

So my initial thought that 3 is lower than 1 and 5 is correct.

So the order remains 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none have this exact order.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that has the meta directors first, then Cl, then activating groups.

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

No, because 6 comes after 2, but 6 should be lower.

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3.

No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

No.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4.

No.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Perhaps I need to think about steric effects.

Substituent 5 is ethyl, which is larger than methyl (substituent 1). So when substituent 5 is present, the ortho positions are more hindered, making para substitution more favorable. So substituent 5 might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. No.

Option B is 6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3. No.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No.

Option D is 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4. No.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. But according to my analysis, 3 should come before 1 and 5.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' para fractions are arranged as follows:

The meta directors have the lowest para fractions, then substituent 3 (Cl), then the activating groups 1 and 5.

Within the activating groups, substituent 5 (C2H5) has a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (CH3), or vice versa.

If the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but none of the options match, perhaps the correct option is not among the choices. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent's para fractions.

Another approach: each substituent's para product formation.

1) CH3 (activating, ortho/para): the major product is para. So the para fraction is high.

2) COOEt (deactivating, meta): the major product is meta. Para product is minor. So para fraction is low.

3) Cl (deactivating, ortho/para): major products are ortho and para. Para fraction is significant but less than activating groups.

4) NO2 (deactivating, meta): major product is meta. Para fraction is low.

5) C2H5 (activating, ortho/para): major product is para. Para fraction is high.

6) COOH (deactivating, meta): major product is meta. Para fraction is low.

So, the order of increasing para fraction is:

Substituents with the lowest para fractions first: 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

Which would be the order:4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this in the options, none match exactly. So perhaps the correct option is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No.

Wait, perhaps the substituents 2 and 4 are arranged differently. Maybe 2 (COOEt) has higher para fraction than 4 (NO2), so the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. Which is option C.

But according to my earlier analysis, 3 (Cl) should have a higher para fraction than 1 and 5. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each substituent's para product fraction.

Substituent | Para Fraction
--- | ---
1) CH3 | High
2) COOEt | Very Low
3) Cl | Medium
4) NO2 | Very Low
5) C2H5 | High
6) COOH | Very Low

So, arrange from lowest to highest:

2,4,6 (all very low) → 3 (medium) → 1,5 (high).

But within 2,4,6, the order depends on substituent strength. Let me think:

NO2 is the strongest deactivator, so its para fraction is the lowest. Then COOH (6), then COOEt (2).

So the order is:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5).

So, the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking for this in the options, it's not present. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.

But according to my analysis, 6 should come after 4. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2's para fraction is higher than 6, so the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But that would imply that substituent 3 (Cl) has the highest para fraction, which isn't the case. Because substituents 1 and 5 have higher para fractions.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options provided.

Given the options, I'll go with option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. But according to my analysis, substituents 1 and 5 should have higher para fractions than 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: the substituent with the highest activating effect will have the highest para fraction. So substituent 5 (C2H5) has a larger substituent than 1 (CH3), so the para product is more favored. So substituent 5 has higher para fraction than 1.

Thus, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5, but higher than the meta directors.

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, the options are:

Option C)4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which would mean substituent 3 has the highest para fraction, which contradicts my earlier analysis.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the substituents' directing effects, the correct order should be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C.


To determine the order of substances 1-6 based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of their substituents:

1. **Substituent Effects**:  
   - **Activating groups** (e.g., -CH3, -C2H5) are ortho/para directors and increase the fraction of the para-isomer.  
   - **Deactivating groups** (e.g., -NO2, -COOH, -COOEt, -Cl) are either meta directors (for -NO2, -COOH, -COOEt) or ortho/para directors (for -Cl). Meta directors result in a very low para-isomer fraction, while ortho/para directors (even deactivating) allow some para-isomer formation.

2. **Relative Para-Fraction Trends**:  
   - **Meta directors** (-NO2, -COOH, -COOEt) have the lowest para-fractions. Among these, the stronger deactivators (-NO2 > -COOH > -COOEt) have progressively lower para-fractions.  
   - **Ortho/para director (deactivating)** (-Cl) has a higher para-fraction than meta directors but is still lower than activating groups.  
   - **Activating groups** (-CH3, -C2H5) have the highest para-fractions. Between them, -C2H5 likely has a slightly higher para-fraction than -CH3 due to reduced steric hindrance at the ortho positions.

3. **Order of Increasing Para-Fraction**:  
   Based on the above analysis, the order of increasing para-fraction is:  
   **4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)**.

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this order with the provided options, the closest match is **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**. While this does not perfectly align with the detailed reasoning (as -Cl should precede -CH3 and -C2H5), it is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

**Answer: C**
