Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about an alien astronaut traveling to Earth at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their spacecraft is super fast, so I guess we'll need to consider relativistic effects here. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are whether they'll die before reaching, or how many years they'll experience.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So their lifespan is pretty long on their own frame of reference. But because they're moving at such a high speed, time dilation comes into play, so their experienced time (proper time) will be less than the time measured in Earth's frame.

First, I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is very close to c here, gamma will be a large number.

Let me compute gamma first. v is 0.99999987c. So v squared over c squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately 0.99999974, right? Because (1 - 0.00000013)^2 is about 1 - 2*0.00000013, which is 0.99999974.

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. Then the square root of this is sqrt(0.00000026). Hmm, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.00051e-3, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's think: 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612e-3.5? Wait, 1e-7
