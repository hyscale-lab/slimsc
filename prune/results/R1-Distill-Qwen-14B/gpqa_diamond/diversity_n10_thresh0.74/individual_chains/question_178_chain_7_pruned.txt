Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm. Let me think. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of the Lorentz group and appear in things like the spin part of the angular momentum.

Wait, the first thing is to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I think I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 (since in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over 4 dimensions).

So each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4. Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

I'll need to find the dimensions of ψ, σ, and F.

I remember that in 4 dimensions, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is a first-order equation, so the fields have to have dimension 3/2 (since the derivative has dimension 1, and the equation is [i∂ - m]ψ = 0, so ψ must balance m, which is dimension 1). So [ψ]_M = 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Wait, σ is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because they are just matrices, not operators with derivatives. So the structure constants or gamma matrices don't contribute to mass dimension. So [σ_{μν}] is the same as [γ_μ, γ_ν], which doesn't add any dimensions. So σ is dimensionless. So [σ]_M = 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative is dimension 1. A is a gauge field, which in 4D has dimension 1. So each term in F would be ∂μ Aν, which is [∂][A] = 1 *1 = 1. So [F^{μν}] is 2? Or wait, wait. A has dimension 1, so each derivative is 1, so each F term is (mass)^{1+1} = mass^2. So [F]_M = 2.

Wait, wait another thought. When you have a field strength tensor, it's like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each term is a derivative (dim 1) of A (dim 1), so each term is mass^2. So F has mass dimension 2. So [F]_M = 2.

Putting it all together:

The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is (3/2 +3/2) = 3. Then, F
