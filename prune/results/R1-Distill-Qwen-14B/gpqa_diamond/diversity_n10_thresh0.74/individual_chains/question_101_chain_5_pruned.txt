Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to give a specific product. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what reagent A and catalyst B are from the options provided.

First, I'll try to visualize the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbon atoms and one nitrogen. The nitrogen has a methyl group attached at position 3. So, the structure is like pyrrolidine where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a CH(CH3).

The product given is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. That name sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down. The main part is 3-methylpyrrolidine, so the substituents are at position 1. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Wait, cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a group where a methyl is attached to a cyclohexene ring.

So, the product has a substituent at position 1 of the pyrrolidine ring. That substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group (–CH2–). So, the structure would be pyrrolidine with a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, maybe it's more like the pyrrolidine has a substituent that is CH2- attached to a cyclohexene. So, the substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene. Or perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group, which is a cyclohexene ring attached via a double bond. Hmm, maybe that's an ene group. Wait, no, "cyclohexylidene" implies a double bond. So, cyclohexylidene group would be a cyclohexene ring with a double bond somewhere, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the substituent is a cyclohexenyl group attached via a single bond.

Wait,
