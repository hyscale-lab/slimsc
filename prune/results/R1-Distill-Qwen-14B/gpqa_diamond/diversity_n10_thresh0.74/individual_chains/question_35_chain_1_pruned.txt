Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem states that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices, which are 2x2 matrices. Oh wait, the structure of S looks familiar. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S here must be the Pauli Y matrix. 

So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * Y, where Y is the Pauli Y matrix. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are known. The Pauli matrices, X, Y, Z, all have eigenvalues ±1. Because when you diagonalize them, their eigenvalues come out as 1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of S (which is Y) are ±1. But since Ay is c times S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c multiplied by ±1.

So c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))*(-1), which simplifies to h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Oh wait, but looking at the options, they mention the imaginary and real parts, but wait, these eigenvalues are real, right? Because the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues. Hmm, so the eigenvalues of Ay are real numbers, either h/(4π) or -h/(4π). 

Wait, but let me check. The matrix S is the Y Pauli matrix, which is Hermitian. So Ay = c*S is also Hermitian because c is real. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the statements about imaginary parts in options A and B might be incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be because eigenvalues
