Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound with 8 carbons in total. Oh wait, and the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So I need to think about what that structure would look like and then match it to the NMR options.

First, let's break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents add up to 2 carbons. Or wait, maybe each substituent can have more than one carbon? Hmm, no, wait. Because di-substituted means two substituents, each substituent could have multiple carbons, but the total number of carbons in the molecule is 8. So 6 from benzene, plus 2 from substituents? Or maybe more?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. So benzene is 6, so the substituents must contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group. But wait, if it's di-substituted, maybe each substituent is -CH2-something. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen?

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. So that's probably a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br. So benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are -X (like Cl, Br) and a carbonyl group, then that would be two substituents. So benzene ring with a halogen and a carbonyl group attached. But wait, a carbonyl group is O=C-, so it's a ketone or something else?

Wait, but if the substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone, that would be a single carbon
