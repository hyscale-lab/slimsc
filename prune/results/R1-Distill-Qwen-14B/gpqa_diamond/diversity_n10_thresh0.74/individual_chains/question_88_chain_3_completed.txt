Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immune response in mice. Hmm, let me think through it.

The scenario is that they've tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice orally. From what I remember, rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, and it's known for having a protein capsid, I think. So the GFP is probably used to track where these proteins end up in the mouse's body.

They observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is HCl, right? So maybe the proteins didn't survive the acidic environment of the stomach. But some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include things like the Peyer's patches, which are located in the intestinal wall. Peyer's patches are sites where immune cells, especially B cells, can sample antigens.

They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cell population. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and found high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests some kind of immune response process that creates diversity in the antibodies.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Wait, what do these processes do?

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development, in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the B cell has been activated, typically in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces point mutations in the variable region, increasing the diversity of antibodies and affinity maturation.

Class switching recombination, also known as isotype switching, is when the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. This occurs after activation, allowing for different functions and requires specific signals.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, helping to clear pathogens via opsonization or lysis, but it doesn't directly cause variability in B cell receptors.

So the question is about a process happening after the initial development of B cells because the B cells are proliferating in the Peyer's patches, which are part of the secondary lymphoid tissues. So VDJ recombination is more about initial diversity in the bone marrow. Somatic hypermutation would occur once the B cells are activated and have formed germinal centers, leading to more varied antibodies.

In this case, the proteins (antigens) are getting into the Peyer's patches and interacting with B cells. The cells are proliferating, which suggests an immune response is being mounted. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes must be due to a process that occurs after the initial formation of the B cell receptor. So that points to somatic hypermutation, as that's when the variable regions are altered to increase diversity and improve antigen binding.

Wait, but wait. Do Peyer's patches have germinal centers? I think that's more of a feature of places like lymph nodes and spleen. Or maybe in some specific cases. Alternatively, maybe the Peyer's patches are inductive sites where naive B cells are activated, leading them to go to the lymph nodes, where they would form germinal centers. But regardless, the process of generating new variable regions after activation is somatic hypermutation.

So the correct answer must be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence is observed to be affected by stomach acid and intestinal mucus, with some reaching the Peyer patches. Upon isolating the proliferating cells from these patches and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes, high variability is noted. This suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors.

The key processes listed in the options are:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, introducing mutations in the variable region of B cell receptors to increase diversity and improve antigen binding.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect B cell receptor variability.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the antibody isotype but does not increase variability in the variable region.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in the variable region.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the Peyer patches indicates that the process occurs after B cell activation, which aligns with somatic hypermutation. This process is consistent with the immune response observed in secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches, where activated B cells proliferate and undergo further diversification.

Answer: A
