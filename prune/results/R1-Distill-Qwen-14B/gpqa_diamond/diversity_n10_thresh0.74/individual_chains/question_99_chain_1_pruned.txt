Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go as slowly as I need to.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options given are four different structures, all of which seem to have some branching and a carboxylic acid group.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The very broad absorption is around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since this is a carboxylic acid, the broad peak is likely from the -OH group in the carboxylic acid. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have strong, broad O-H stretches.

Then, the FTIR also shows a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That peak is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, that's consistent because the carbonyl in the COOH group would show up around 1700 cm⁻¹. Other possibilities for 1700 could be ketones or esters, but given the structures, it's definitely the COOH.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds (like alkenes) in the molecule. All the structures given don't have double bonds, so that's a checkmark for all options.

The NMR has some more specific information. One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, complex splitting patterns. Let me think about what that implies.

In NMR, splitting occurs due to neighboring (vicinal) hydrogens. The more neighbors a proton has, the more complex the splitting. For example, a quartet (4 peaks) is usually from coupling with three equivalent protons. A triplet (3 peaks) comes from two adjacent protons. But when you have a doublet of triplets, it means the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, each causing a triplet.

Wait, maybe it's a case where each proton is next to two different groups. So, for a doublet of triplets, perhaps the proton is next to a group with two protons (like a CH₂) and another group with two protons as well. Or maybe one group with two and another with three, but I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options, all the structures have a central part where there are four substituents attached to a carbon, perhaps. Let me try to draw them out mentally.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like CH3-C(-H)(C2H5)-C(-H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The central two carbons each have a CH group attached to ethyl groups and a CH2 group connected to the COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(-H)(C2H5)-C(-H)(C2H5)-COOH. Here, the central carbons are each attached to an ethyl and a CH2CH3 group, and the COOH is directly connected to one of the central carbons.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So it's (CH3)₂CH-C(-H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH? Wait, maybe I should think again. Structure is CH3-C(-H)(CH3)-C(-H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the central carbons each have an H, two methyl groups, and connected to a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So CH2CH3-C(-H)(CH3)-C(-H)(CH3)-COOH. Each central carbon has a CH group with a methyl and ethyl attached, and the COOH is directly attached.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals. The signals are multiplets, which implies that the protons are near multiple sets of non-equivalent protons.

Let me think about the possible structures. Each option has a central part where two CH groups are attached to various substituents.

In the NMR, the different splitting patterns could come from different environments. For example, if a proton is next to two different groups, each with two protons, then each coupling would split the signal into a triplet, leading to a doublet of triplets. Alternatively, if
