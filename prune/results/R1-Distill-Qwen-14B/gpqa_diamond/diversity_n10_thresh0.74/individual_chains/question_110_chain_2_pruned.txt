Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. That means any star with a V mag less than or equal to 17 is visible to ESPRESSO. Wait, no—wait, actually, the wording says "brighter than 17 mag", so I think that means stars with V mag less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. So brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V < 17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V < 16.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (for HIRES). Wait, no—no, wait. The question is asking which stars can be detected by both. So a star must be detectable by both spectrographs. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So the star's apparent V must be <=16, because that's the stricter
