Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem says an atomic nucleus at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV undergoes spontaneous fission. It splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 (of the more massive fragment) and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

Wait, initial rest mass is 300 GeV. So, M c² is 300 GeV. Then, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 M. Let's let the smaller fragment have mass m. Then the larger is 2m. So total rest mass is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M. Therefore, the larger fragment has mass 2*(0.99/3) M = 0.66 M, and the smaller is 0.33 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M, but no wait, 3m is 0.99 M, so m is (0.99/3) M. So the larger fragment is 2m = (0.66) M. So the masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the rest-mass energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So each fragment's rest-mass energy is m1 c² and m2 c². So m1 is (0.66) M, m2 is (0.33) M.

Because the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me think about the energies. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. But since the nucleus was at rest, the
