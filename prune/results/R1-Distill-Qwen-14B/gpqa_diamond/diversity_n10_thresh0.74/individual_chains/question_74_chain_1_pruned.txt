Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Wait, but probability in radioactive decay—oh right, that usually relates to the decay constant or the half-life. But wait, the way the question is phrased says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that might actually be the cumulative probability over that time.

So, the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes starting from now, so the additional time. But I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

I think the key here is that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. But wait, the probability over a certain time isn't straightforward because it's a Poisson process, right? The decay probability in a given time interval is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or wait, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that.

Wait, but the given data says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32). So the survival probability after 100 minutes is
