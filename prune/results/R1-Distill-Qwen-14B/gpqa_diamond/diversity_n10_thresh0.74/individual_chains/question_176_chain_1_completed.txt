Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1), but wait, that might not be a unit vector. Oh, right, I should probably normalize it first. Oh wait, no, actually, in quantum mechanics, the states are usually represented as column vectors, but they also need to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of their components should equal 1. Let me check that. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but the question says the state is given as (-1,2,1), perhaps they just present it without the normalization. But when doing calculations, I might need to normalize it.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring P and then Q. So, the first step is to measure P, get a certain outcome, and then measure Q on the new state. But the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. 

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." Oh, right, so first measure P, get 0, then measure Q and get -1. So I need to find the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then measure Q on the resulting state, get -1.

Alternatively, maybe it's the probability that when you measure P and then Q, you get 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So the process is:

1. Measure P on state |ψ>.
2. If P gives 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0.
3. Then measure Q on that new state.
4. Find the probability that Q gives -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the joint probability, which is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1 given that P was 0.

Alternatively, another approach is to find the state after measuring P as 0, and then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that state.

But first, let me make sure I understand the setup.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's call this vector |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But we need to normalize it since the sum of squares is 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))[-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but perhaps the state is already given as a normalized vector. Wait, the sum is 6, so the vector as given isn't normalized. So in calculations, I should use the normalized vector.

So first, when measuring P, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The operator P has the matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

What are the eigenvalues of P? Hmm, perhaps the matrix is symmetric, so it should have real eigenvalues.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let me try to find them.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ],
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ] 

Let me compute this step by step.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expansion. Let me expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det[ [ -λ, 1/√2 ], [1/√2, -λ ] ] 
- (1/√2) * det[ [1/√2, 1/√2 ], [0, -λ ] ]
+ 0 * det[ ... ] 

So, first term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
= -(1/√2) * [ (-λ /√2 ) ] 
= -(1/√2)(-λ / √2) ) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is zero.

So determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Let me expand that:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Wait, because:

-λ*(λ² - 1/2) is -λ³ + (λ/2).

Wait, no: (λ² - 1/2) is λ² - 0.5, so when multiplied by -λ, you get -λ³ + (1/2)λ.

Then the second term is λ/2, so adding them:

-λ³ + (1/2)λ + (1/2)λ = -λ³ + λ.

So determinant is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ (-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ (λ² -1 )=0 → λ (λ-1)(λ+1) )=0.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Interesting. So the possible eigenvalues for P are 0, 1, and -1.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, then find the overlap with the state |ψ>.

Wait, the state |ψ> is 1/sqrt(6) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So first, let's find the eigenvector of P for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So matrix P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0;

1/√2, 0, 1/√2;

0, 1/√2, 0 ]

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2=0.

Which are consistent with v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1.

So we can choose v1 = a, v2=0, v3=-a.

So the eigenvector is a*(1, 0, -1)^T.

Since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar, we can normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

Let me denote this as |p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

So when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to this |p0> state.

Now, the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and |p0>.

So |<p0 | ψ>|^2.

Compute this.

|ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So <p0 | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Which is: (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)).

So that's (-1 -1 )/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/ (2 * sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is (1/3).

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute this again. Because sometimes I might have messed up the signs or the normalization.

So <p0| is [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

|ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)) )

Which is:

[ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1) -1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2) / (2 * sqrt(3)) )

= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. So that's the first part: P=0 occurs with probability 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state becomes |p0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

Now, we need to measure Q. The operator Q is given by the matrix:

[1, 0, 0;

0, 0, 0;

0, 0, -1]

This is a diagonal matrix, so the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, actually, the diagonal entries are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about getting Q=-1.

So the eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors, I think. Because the matrix is diagonal.

For eigenvalue 1: the eigenvector is [1, 0, 0]^T.

For eigenvalue 0: [0, 1, 0]^T.

For eigenvalue -1: [0, 0, 1]^T.

So, the state after measuring P=0 is |p0> = [1/sqrt(2); 0; -1/sqrt(2)].

We need to find the probability that measuring Q gives -1.

So that's the square of the absolute value of the amplitude of the |q-1> state in |p0>.

Wait, |q-1> is the eigenvector for Q=-1, which is [0,0,1]^T.

So the inner product is <q-1 | p0> = (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ) + 0*(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.

So the total probability is the probability of P=0 times the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer should be option D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The state is initially provided as \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), but it is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Measurement of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields the eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is found by solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
|p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the overlap between \( | \psi \rangle \) and \( |p_0\rangle \):

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle p_0 | \psi \rangle \right|^2.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle p_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Measurement of \( Q \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |q_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |q_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |p_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the overlap between \( |p_0\rangle \) and \( |q_{-1}\rangle \):

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle \right|^2.
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | p_0 \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Joint Probability
The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
