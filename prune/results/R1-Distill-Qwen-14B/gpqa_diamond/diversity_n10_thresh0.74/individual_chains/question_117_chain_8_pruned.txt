Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when compounds have different structures due to the arrangement of atoms in space, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. So like enantiomers, which are a type of stereoisomer. The question is which of the given compounds exhibit this.

The options given are four moieties, and the choices are combinations of them. Let me go through each one by one.

First, compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, but in biphenyl systems, if the substituents are in positions that can allow for different configurations, like if the rings can rotate such that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides. So, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that can lead to cis or trans arrangements, then it can have stereoisomerism. But wait, in biphenyls, rotation around the central bond usually allows for different conformations, but if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, maybe it doesn't allow for stereoisomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror images, then they might have optical isomers. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, biphenyl groups can have cis and trans isomers if the substituents are in positions that can't be rotated into each other. Oh wait, in this case, the nitro groups are at the 6 and 6' positions. Looking at the structure, the biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at position 1 and
