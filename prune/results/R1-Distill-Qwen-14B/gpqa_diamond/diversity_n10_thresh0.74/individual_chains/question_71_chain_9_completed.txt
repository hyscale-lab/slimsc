Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, which are in orbital resonance. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for calculating temperatures. Probably not, since the question is about the temperature ratio.

The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2P1, Planet_3 is 2.5P1, Planet_4 is 3.5P1, and Planet_5 is 5P1. Got it.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light a planet reflects. Since albedo is the same for both, that factor cancels out in the ratio.

I think equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the incoming starlight and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I recall is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since albedo is same for both, L and σ are constants too, so the temperature depends on the distance D.

Wait, but wait. The distance D is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Oh right! Kepler's law states that P² is proportional to D³ (assuming same star mass). So P² ∝ D³. That means D ∝ P^(2/3).

So the ratio of distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let me plug in the numbers.

P4/P2 is 3.5 divided by 2, which is 1.75. So D4 = D2 * (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's 1.75^(2/3)? Let me compute that.

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let me think. Alternatively, I can compute using exponents. Let me approximate it. Let's compute ln(7/4) first. Ln(1.75) is approximately 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 2/3 ≈ 0.373. Then exponentiate, e^0.373 ≈ 1.452. So D4 is about 1.452 times D2.

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to D^0.5 (since T ∝ (1/D^0.5) because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), so (1/D²)^(1/4) is 1/D^0.5. Wait, no, let me re-derive that.

The equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L (1-a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this correctly.

Yes, the formula is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So the temperature is inversely proportional to D^0.5 because D is squared, and then you take the fourth root. So the exponent becomes (1/4)*(-2) = -0.5. So T ∝ 1/(D^0.5).

So the ratio T4/T2 would be (D2/D4)^0.5. Because T is inversely proportional to D^0.5.

So first, let's calculate D4/D2 as (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ 1.452 as I found earlier. So D4 = 1.452 D2.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (D2 / D4)^0.5 = (1 / 1.452)^0.5. Let's compute 1/1.452 ≈ 0.6896. Then take the square root of that. The square root of 0.6896 is roughly... let's see. 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is very close. So approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have exactly 0.83. Let me check the options again. Option C is ~0.83, which would be the case. But I'm not entirely confident about the calculation steps.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the exact ratio step by step.

Compute P4/P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. So D4³ / D2³ = (P4²)/(P2²) = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625. So D4/D2 = (3.0625)^(1/3). Let's compute that cube root.

What's cube of 1.45? Let me see: 1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.45^3 = (1.4 + 0.05)^3. Let me compute:

(1.4)^3 = 2.744

3*(1.4)^2 *0.05 = 3*(1.96)*0.05 = 0.294.

3*(1.4)*(0.05)^2 = 3*1.4 *0.0025 = 0.0105.

(0.05)^3 = 0.000125.

So adding up: 2.744 + 0.294 = 2.038; +0.0105 = 2.0485; +0.000125 is ~2.0486. But 1.45^3 is about 3.05 (Wait, 1.45^3 is (1.45)*(1.45)^2. 1.45^2 is 2.1025, times 1.45: 2.1025 *1.45. Let's compute: 2 *1.45 = 2.9, 0.1025 *1.45 ≈ 0.149 approx. So total ~3.049.)

Wait, so 1.45^3 ≈ 3.05. Which is very close to our computed 3.0625. So D4/D2 is approximately 1.45.

So D4 = 1.45 D2.

So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So T4 = T2 * (D2/(1.45 D2))^(1/2) ?

Wait, no, wait. T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So T4 = T2 * (D2 / D4). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = sqrt(D2/D4).

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's express the temperatures:

T4 = (L(1-a)/(16πσ D4²))^(1/4)
T2 = (L(1-a)/(16πσ D2²))^(1/4)

So the ratio T4/T2 = [ (D2²) / (D4²) ) ]^(1/4) = (D2/D4)^(1/2).

Yes, that's right. So T4/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 ) = sqrt(1/(D4/D2)) ).

Since D4/D2 is approximately 1.45, the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(1/1.45) ≈ sqrt(0.6897) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.

Alternatively, let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute (3.5/2)^(2/3) exactly.

3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 = 7/4 = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3) is the same as e^( (2/3) * ln(1.75) )

ln(1.75) is approximately 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.373. e^0.373 is approximately 1.452.

So D4=1.452 D2.

Thus, T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = 1/(1.452)^(1/2) ≈ 1/1.205 = approximately 0.829.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, sqrt(1.452) is approximately 1.205. So 1/1.205 is about 0.829. So approximately 0.83, which is option C.

So the correct answer should be C) ~0.83.


To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, \( D \), due to the formula:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). Using Kepler's third law, the distance \( D \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Given \( P_4 = 3.5 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75
\]

\[
\frac{D_4}{D_2} = (1.75)^{2/3}
\]

Approximating \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we find:

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad \text{so } (1.75)^{2/3} = e^{(2/3) \cdot 0.5596} \approx e^{0.373} \approx 1.452
\]

Thus, \( D_4 \approx 1.452 D_2 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4 / T_2 \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{D_4 / D_2} \):

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}}
\]

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} \approx \sqrt{0.6897} \approx 0.83
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), corresponding to option C.
