Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different substances with excess bromine. They all undergo this reaction, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield.

Hmm, wait. Electrophilic substitution, right. So for each compound, when bromine (excess) adds, the bromine acts as an electrophile and substitutes into the benzene ring. Because it's an electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring will determine where the bromine adds.

Each of these substituents is an activating or deactivating group. Activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to ortho, meta, or para positions, while deactivating groups do the opposite. Also, the activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the reaction is more likely.

Wait, but what's the question exactly? It's about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to find the major product for each substance, particularly whether the substitution occurs predominantly in the para position.

The key point is that each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. For each substituent, I should determine whether it's an activating or deactivating group, and whether it's meta or para directing.

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Since it's activating, there's more substitution, but when multiple positions are possible, the para isomer tends to be more major than the ortho because the para position is less hindered.

Wait, but for methyl, which is an activating group, substitution occurs at ortho and para. So in mono-bromination, the major products would be ortho and para. But which is more?

I remember that for substituents that are ortho/para directors, in the case of a single substituent, the major product is often the para isomer, but sometimes ortho can be more. Wait, but for a benzyl group like methyl, which is activating, the para product is usually more favored because the ortho positions are more crowded, especially in case of substituents that are larger than H.
