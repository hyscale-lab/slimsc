Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're told that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. Hmm.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I think I need to compute this for each part of the operator and add them up.

Wait, the operator is 10σ_z plus 5σ_x. So maybe I can split this into two separate expectation values: 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear.

So first, let me compute ⟨σ_z⟩. Since σ_z has eigenvalues for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. I remember that σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

The state ψ is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So let's write it as |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me make sure that the coefficients are correct. Oh yeah, 0.5 is 1/2, and sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. Wait, but wait, does 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 equal 1? Let's check: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4 = 0.75. Adding them up gives 1. So yes, the state is normalized. That's good.

So for ⟨σ_z⟩, because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation value is |a|^2 times the eigenvalue of |↑⟩ plus |b|^2 times the eigenvalue of |↓⟩. So that would be |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1).

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σ_z⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is ⟨σ_x⟩. Oh, wait, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates aren't |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Instead, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So calculating ⟨σ_x⟩ isn't as straightforward as with σ_z.

I think the expectation value of σ_x for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as 2 times the real part of the coefficient of |↑⟩ multiplied by the coefficient of |↓⟩, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another approach is to express σ_x in terms of its matrix form and compute the expectation value.

Oh wait, σ_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is computed as follows:

First, write |ψ⟩ as [a, b]^T. So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σ_x |ψ⟩ would be the matrix multiplied by the vector. Let's compute that: [0* a + 1*b, 1*a + 0*b]^T = [b, a]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of [a*, b*] multiplied by [b, a]^T. So that's a* * b + b* * a.

Since a and b are real numbers here, this simplifies to a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab.

Let me plug in the values of a and b. a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2) * (0.5) is 1, then multiplied by sqrt(3)/2. So 1 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure that's correct. Because ⟨σ_x⟩ for this state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the standard formula for expectation of σ_x. Let me think. The expectation value is given by ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Expressed in the computational basis, |↑⟩ = [1,0]^T and |↓⟩ = [0,1]^T.

So |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σ_x |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Wait, no. σ_x swaps the components. So [a, b] becomes [b, a]. So σ_x |ψ⟩ is [sqrt
