Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is among the four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm, I'll try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that NMR data gives us information about the structure. Let me look at the given data again. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). 

Wait, the acetate group usually has an ester functional group. So the structure should be an ester, like R-O-CO-R'. Since the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, the acetate part is likely the OAc group, with R being the propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me think about each option's structure. The propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but in this case, for the ester, it's attached as the substituent.

Wait, maybe I should draw each structure. So, for propenyl acetate, it's CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But wait, no, the propenyl group as an ester would be O connected to a CH2CH=CH2 group. Hmm, but wait, the position of the double bond matters because that affects the NMR.

Wait, the other options are butenyl acetates, which would be longer chains. For example, butenyl is four carbons, so something like CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So for butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (cis or trans), or maybe CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-COCH3? Wait, no, the position of the double bond might vary.

Let me think about the NMR signals.

The first peak is at 7.0 ppm, a doublet with J=1
