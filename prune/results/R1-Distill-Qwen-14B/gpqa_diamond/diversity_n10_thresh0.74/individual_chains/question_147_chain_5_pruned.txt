Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its speed is much less than the speed of light, or maybe non-relativistic? But wait, I'm not entirely sure. The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know. In annihilation processes, like when particles and their antiparticles meet, they convert their mass into energy, usually photons. But here, instead of photons, they're producing two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So the products are these A particles.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate it as a non-relativistic case. But wait, when dealing with high-energy particles, relativistic effects can be significant. Hmm, but the problem states it's moving slowly, so maybe non-relativistic is okay. Or perhaps it's just that the kinetic energy isn't too high. I'll have to think about that.

The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton is the same. So the total rest mass energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, the products are
