Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, and N is 1. So plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11)/2=9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:

Wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=9, H=11, X=0, N=1:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (18+2=20; 20-11=9; 9+1=10) /2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Hmm. Each double bond or ring is one, each triple bond is two, etc. So 5 could be like a benzene ring (3 double bonds) plus a carbonyl (1), and maybe an amide group? Or maybe other structures.

Now, looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretching. But since the compound has an amide group, maybe it's the amide N-H. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. But the presence of both amide N-H and a carbonyl could fit, perhaps.

The 1H NMR is next. Let's break it down:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2. Like an ethyl group where the CH2 is next to another CH2.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, integrating for 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group, perhaps in an ester or amide. The broadness could suggest some hydrogen bonding, like in an amide.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, integrating for 2H. Quartet suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So this could be a CH2CH3 group where each H is split by the neighboring CH2. For example, in an ester group, like OCH2CH3. Wait, but the 4.0 ppm is 2H, and 4.5 is another 2H. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to an OCH2 group.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and
