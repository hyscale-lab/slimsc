Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy comes mostly from the proton-proton chain, and there are different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, I think. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the triple-alpha process, which produces carbon-12 and then goes on to make heavier elements, but I might be getting some details mixed up.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's about the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So, if the process stops, the energy production from that branch would stop, and that would affect the neutrinos we detect here. But how does that affect the flux of neutrinos in different energy bands?

I'm a bit fuzzy on the neutrino types here. Solar neutrinos are mostly electron neutrinos, right? Oh, and the different branches produce different neutrino energies. I remember that the pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos, while the higher branches (like pp-II and pp-III) produce higher energy ones. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos should drop, but the lower ones might remain unaffected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of two specific bands: 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is a lower energy range than band 2.
