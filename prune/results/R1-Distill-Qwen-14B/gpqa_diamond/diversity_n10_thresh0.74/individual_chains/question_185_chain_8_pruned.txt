Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian give the possible energy levels. 

The given Hamiltonian is H = εσ·n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So each component σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli spin matrices. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, so it's a direction in space. 

I think the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. For example, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But when you take the dot product with n, it's like σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. 

So the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by this sum. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Wait, but the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1, right? Oh wait but σ·n is a combination. Hmm, not exactly, because when you have a vector in a particular direction, the Pauli matrices in that direction will have eigenvalues ±1. 

Wait, but the matrix σ·n is a Hermitian matrix because all the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So H is also Hermitian because it's a product of ε (a scalar) and a Hermitian matrix. So the eigenvalues must be real.

Now, eigenvalues of σ·n. Let's think about it. Let me denote σ·n as a matrix. What's the trace of σ·n? Each Pauli matrix has trace 0, so the sum would also have trace 0. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the trace is zero, the eigenvalues are λ and -λ. So the eigenvalues will be something like a and -a, where a is the magnitude.

What's the determinant of σ·n? The determinant for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is ad - bc. Let's compute (σ·n):

σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Each σ_i has the form [[something]]. Let me compute σ·n as a matrix. Let's see:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_y σ_y is [[0, -i n_y], [i n_y, 0]]
n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding these together, the matrix σ·n becomes:

Top left: n_z
Top right: n_x - i n_y
Bottom left: n_x + i n_y
Bottom right: -n_z

So the matrix is:

[[n_z, n_x - i n_y],
 [n_x + i n_y, -n_z]]

Now, the trace is n_z - n_z = 0, which we already knew. Now, the determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y).

Let me compute the second term: (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = (n_x)^2 + (n_y)^2, because (a -b)(a + b) = a² - b², but wait (i n_y)(-i n_y) would be (i)(-i) n_y² = (1) n_y². So expand:

(n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = (n_x)^2 + i n_x n_y - i n_y n_x + (i)(-i) n_y^2
= n_x^2 + (i -i) n_x n_y + (1) n_y^2
= n_x^2 + n_y^2.

Wait, because (i)(-i) is (-i^2) which is (-(-1))=1. So yes, that term is 1. 

So determinant is (-n_z^2) - (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = -(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2). But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So the determinant becomes -1.

Wait, but determinant is the product of eigenvalues. Wait, determinant for a 2x2 matrix is (λ1)(λ2). But we know the trace is λ1 + λ2 =0, so λ2 = -λ1. Therefore, λ1 * λ2 = -λ1² = determinant.

The determinant we found is -1, so -λ1² = -1 → λ1² =1 → λ1= ±1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n) . So the eigenvalues would be ε * (±1), so ±ε.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the σ·n matrix has eigenvalues ±1, so when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε. So the eigenvalues of H are +ε and -ε.

So looking at the options: option B is +ε, -ε.

Alternatively, let me think about spin in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for a spin-½ particle in a magnetic field in direction n is proportional to σ·n. The eigenvalues would correspond to ± the gyromagnetic ratio times the magnetic field, which would be ±ε in this case
