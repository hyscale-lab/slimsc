Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Esters usually have specific absorption peaks in IR, like around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's good, so we know an ester is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals in total. Breaking them down, two are aromatic H's. So, that suggests the substituents are in such positions that the aromatic protons are split into two different environments. For example, maybe the substituents are in para positions, but then the protons would all be equivalent if it's a para di-substitution. Hmm, but wait, in the case of para substitution, you would have two sets of aromatic protons: maybe two doublets or something else. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho to each other, maybe the ring's symmetry is broken. Wait, no, since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that lead to different aromatic environments.

Then, the NMR has two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl H are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One of them is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. That seems a bit tricky. Let's think about what that might imply. For a vinyl group, the coupling usually depends on the neighboring groups. If it's part of an ester group, like maybe an ethyl ester, then the CH2 groups would be split. But wait, in the NMR, there are no signals for CH2 groups. Hmm, but the question says there are two signals for -CH3 groups.

Wait, so the NMR signals are: two aromatic, two vinyl, two CH3. No CH2. So the structure likely doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups. Let me think. If it's an ester, the ester group is R-O-CO-R', so perhaps one R is a methyl group and the other is something else, but let's see.

So, the aromatic part is a di-substituted benzene. Let's say substituents are A and B. Each substituent could be an ester group, but wait, an ester is an ORCOOR type group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else? But the question says it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, so both substituents might be the same or different.

Wait, the FTIR shows presence of ester group, so maybe one of the substituents is an ester. But wait, could the substituents be ester groups? Like, for example, two ester groups attached to benzene? Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a methyl group or another substituent.

But the NMR data includes two CH3 groups. So, maybe there are two methyl groups somewhere
