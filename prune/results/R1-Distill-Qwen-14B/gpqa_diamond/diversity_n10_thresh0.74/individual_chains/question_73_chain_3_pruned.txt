Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Hmm, right. So I think the first part is about finding the relative speed between them, and the second part is about the total energy.

Wait, but wait. When dealing with relative speed in relativity, I can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's not just v1 - v2 divided by 1 minus the product over c squared or something like that. Let me get the formula right.

The formula for relative velocity u' when you have two objects moving at v and u relative to a common frame is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Is that right? Or is it (v - u)/(1 - (v*u)/(c²))? Wait, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), because if you're moving at v and the other at u, the relative speed from the first's perspective would be u - v, adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, let me double-check. Suppose object A is moving at v relative to the lab frame, and object B is moving at u. Then the speed of B as seen from A is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2? It would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 -
