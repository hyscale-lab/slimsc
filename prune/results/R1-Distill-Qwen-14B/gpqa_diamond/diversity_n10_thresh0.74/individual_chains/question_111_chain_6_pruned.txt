Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given. 

First, let's tackle reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I'm thinking this might be an example of a Claisen condensation or some kind of enolate formation.

Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives reacting with acrylates... Oh right, this is probably a Michael addition or a conjugate addition. Or maybe it's a crossed aldol reaction, but given that ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it's more likely a conjugate addition.

Wait, no, wait. The starting material is a cyclic ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl), another methyl maybe? Let me draw this. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. C2 has an ethyl group, and C6 has a methyl. Wait, wait the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So positions 2 has an ethyl and a methyl? No, wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So the substituents at C2 are ethyl and methyl? Or wait, maybe that's not the case. Wait, wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? No, wait, 2-ethyl would mean an ethyl substituent at C2, and 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at C2 and C6? No, that can't be. Wait
