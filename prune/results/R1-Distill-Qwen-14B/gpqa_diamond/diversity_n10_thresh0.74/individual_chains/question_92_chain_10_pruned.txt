Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, it's a molecule with two double bonds, I think. Each end has a substituent with CH3 groups attached. Maybe it's a diene or something similar.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. The formula is something like:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds) - Σ (Bond energies of product bonds) divided by 2, perhaps? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the reactants and subtracting the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds formed in the products. Or wait, no, I get confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, for a hydrocarbon, you'd break down the bonds in the reactants (like O2, H2, and C) and then form the bonds in the products (like
