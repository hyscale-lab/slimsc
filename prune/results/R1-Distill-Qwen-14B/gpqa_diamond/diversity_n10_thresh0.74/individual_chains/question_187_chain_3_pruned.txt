Alright, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the given stars meet this condition when observed with ESPRESSO coupled to an 8m VLT telescope at Paranal.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method, I think. High resolution means it can see fine spectral lines, but I'm not sure how that relates to S/N.

The S/N ratio depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the instrument's efficiency, and the noise sources like background radiation. But since all the options are observed for the same exposure time (1 hour), the main factor here would be the apparent brightness of each star.

Wait, but the options give the absolute magnitude (V) and the distance. So I can calculate the apparent magnitude for each star using the distance modulus formula. Absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) the star would have at 10 parsecs. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me calculate m for each option:

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star. Checking my memory, Canopus is about magnitude -0.74. So that's way brighter than the others. But wait, the options don't give M for Canopus; they give M for others. Hmm, perhaps I should look up Canopus's apparent magnitude. Oh wait, the question gives each option's M and distance. Or wait, no, option a is Canopus, which is a known star. So perhaps I need to remember its apparent magnitude. Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to know that Canopus is very bright, so it's definitely detectable.

Wait, but the other options (b, c, d, e, f) give both M and distance. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute their apparent magnitudes using the distance modulus. Let's focus on those.

But let's go back. For the stars with given M and distance, I can compute their m.

Option a: Canopus. I don't have M and distance given. Let me think. Canopus is about 10 parsecs away? No, wait, Canopus is about 300 pc away. Or maybe I'm confusing it with another star. Wait, I might be mixing up distances. Wait, Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and is the second brightest star in the night sky. It's about 300 parsecs away. So M is about -5.7? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should just note that Canopus is very bright, so its m is much lower than the others, making it easily detectable.

But for the other options, each has M=15 and varying distances.

Option b: Polaris. Hmm, Pol
