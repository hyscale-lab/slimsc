Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. 

First, let's note down the given information. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So if Star_2's radius is R, Star_1's is 1.5R. Also, their masses are in the same ratio—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Interesting, but wait, the question is about luminosity. So how does mass relate here? Well, maybe it's a red herring, but I'll keep it in mind.

They mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because for black bodies, same peak wavelength implies same temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point. So then, what determines their luminosities?

The luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where R is the radius, T the temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both have the same T, the luminosity ratio will depend on the square of their radii. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Because T is same, the T^4 term cancels out.

So R1 is 1.5 R2. So the ratio R1/R2 is 1.5. Squared is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, let me think again. The question says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor, so our initial calculation would suggest 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options include B, C, D with slightly higher numbers. Why is that? Did I miss something?

Wait, maybe I'm missing the Doppler effect here. Because the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away
