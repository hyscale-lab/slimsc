Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions would give the desired product in high yield.

Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break that down. The main structure is a phenyl group substituted with two groups: a bromo at position 3 and a nitro at position 5. Attached to that phenyl group is an ethan-1-one, which is a ketone (since the ketone is at position 1, meaning it's on the same carbon as the phenyl group). So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and a ketone group attached to position 1.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number the positions. If the ketone is attached to position 1, then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So, positions 1 (where the ketone is), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). Wait, that would mean the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other? Let me visualize it. Benzene ring with the ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So, positions 1,3,5 are all substituted. So that's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, no, because it's 3-bromo and 5-nitro on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. So the benzene ring is attached to the ketone group, and on that benzene, there are substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone's attachment point.

So the ketone is at position 1 (the point of attachment), and then on the benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2 groups, respectively. So the substituents are on the meta positions of the benzene
