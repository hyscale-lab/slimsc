Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement of a specific bicyclic compound. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, which typically happens in 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new six-membered ring, right?

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene derivative with a nitrogen atom. The numbering is a bit tricky, but I think the bicyclo structure is such that the bridgehead positions are 1, 2, and 4. Wait, no, the bicyclo notation is [n.m.p], so for [2.2.1], the bridges are 2, 2, and 1 carbons. So the structure has two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. The nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?) attached there. Wait, no, the vinyl is -CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's attached to the nitrogen.

So the molecule is a norbornene with a substituent. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, right? So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 in the bridge. But in this case, it's hept-5-ene, which would place the double bond elsewhere. Wait, let me think again. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene: the double bond is at position 5. So the structure has seven atoms in the ring, with two bridges of two carbons and one bridge of one. So, the bridges are connecting atoms 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1, perhaps? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Alternatively, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps. Wait, perhaps it's better to number the bicyclo system. Let me recall: bicyclo[m.n.p] systems have the bridgeheads at positions 1 and
