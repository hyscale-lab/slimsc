Okay, let's see. I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let me try to break this down.

First, I'll read through the problem again and try to outline what's happening step by step.

So, the reactions given are:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what C, D, E, etc., are based on these reactions. Once I know what E is, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me think about each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Solid A reacting with gas B to form a red product. What comes to mind is maybe a transition metal compound. For example, sulfur reacting with something? Or maybe the Haber process? No, that's for ammonia. Wait, bright red product—could it be something like lead dioxide (PbO2)? Or perhaps something with sulfur. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving vanadium or chromium, which have colored compounds. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is Cl2. But 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na, which doesn't make much sense because sodium typically forms +1 ions. Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is Cl2. But then 8 moles of Cl2 to 1 mole of Al would form AlCl4^- maybe? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking at the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when a metal oxide reacts with water
