Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

So the question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The potential well has a length L, and each particle is spin-1/2, meaning they can be either spin-up or spin-down. The energy given is E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), which I remember is the ground state energy for a single particle in such a well. So I guess each particle's energy depends on their quantum number.

Wait, right. For a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the ground state energy (n=1). So for each particle, their energy depends on their quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical fermions. Oh right, particles with half-integer spin are fermions, and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system. So each particle must have a unique state.

But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, it has two possible spin states: up and down. So each level n can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

So the ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible for four particles. Let's think about how to fill the energy levels with these particles.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy for the system. Since each n can take two particles (because of spin), let's see how the four particles will fill up the lowest energy states.

So the first level, n=1, can hold two particles. The next level, n=2, can hold another two. But wait, but there are four particles. So for the ground state, the first two particles go into n=1 (spin up and down), and the next two go into n=2. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For four particles, the first two will go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), and the next two must go into higher states. But since each n can hold two, the next available is n=2, which can take two more. So for four particles, all four would be in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me correct that. Each n can hold two particles (because of spin). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each spin), the next two go into n=2, each spin. So in the ground state, the particles are in n=1, 1; n=2, 1 and 2. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, each n can have two particles with opposite spins. So n=1 has two particles (each spin), n=2 has two more, each in its own spin state. So n=1 and n=2 are filled.

Wait, but wait, no, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for the
