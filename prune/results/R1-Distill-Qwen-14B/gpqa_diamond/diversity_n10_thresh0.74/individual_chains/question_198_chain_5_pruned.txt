Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes and determining the percentage of a specific blue complex in the solution.

Alright, first, I remember that stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, β4 is 16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because I thought β usually increases with the number of ligands attached. Hmm, maybe β4 is for a different complex, like maybe a different geometry or something.

The problem states that the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I think the blue complexes of Co(II) are typically the tetracyanonickelate or something. Oh wait, for cobalt, the common ones are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The blue one is probably [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which is the tetrathiocyanatocobaltate(III) ion? Or wait, no, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2−. I'm a bit confused about the exact complexes.

But the question specifically refers to the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ions attached. So maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2− or [Co(SCN)_2]^n−. But wait, I think the blue ones are the tetra-substituted complexes. Oh wait, no, perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, which is a tetrahedral complex. But I'm not entirely sure. Well, perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^3−, but the question says dithiocyanato, which is two SCN groups. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the given stability constants.

Wait, the stability constants are given as
