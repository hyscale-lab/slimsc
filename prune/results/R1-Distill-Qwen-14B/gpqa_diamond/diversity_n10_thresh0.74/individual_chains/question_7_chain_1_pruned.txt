Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, it's a process related to photon-photon interactions. I think the key here is to find the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant enough that the gamma-ray can't travel too far before annihilating. So, the lifetime is limited by how quickly they interact.

I think the process in question is the inverse Compton scattering or maybe the photon-photon annihilation. Wait, the problem states it's gamma plus photon annihilating into electron-positron pairs, so it's the gamma-gamma -> e+ e- reaction. So, it's a two-photon annihilation process.

The cross-section for this process probably depends on the energies of the photons involved. Since one photon is from the CMB, which has a low energy, and the other is a high-energy gamma-ray, the cross-section will peak when the two photons have similar energies. Or wait, maybe it's when the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce the electron-positron pair.

The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV. So for the process to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least twice the electron mass, right? Oh wait, wait, that's for electron-positron pair production. So the condition is that the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) is at least 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But for high-energy photons, the CMB photon is low energy, so I guess the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy to make the total energy meet that threshold.

Wait, but the problem is about the limit on the gamma-ray's lifetime. So the gamma-ray is traveling through space and interacts with CMB photons. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the number of target photons along its path.

The interaction probability per unit length (proper length) would be something like n * sigma * c, where n is the number density of CMB photons, sigma is the cross-section, and c is the speed of light.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray is limited if the interaction probability is high enough that the mean
