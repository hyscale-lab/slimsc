Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question gives me four matrices W, X, Y, Z and asks which statement about them is correct among options A to D.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices represent operators, and the evolution operator is related to the time evolution of a quantum state. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which corresponds to measurable quantities.

Let me look at each matrix and their properties. I need to check if they are Hermitian, unitary, etc.

Starting with matrix W:
W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Wait, to check if it's Hermitian, W should equal its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose (dagger) of W would have the same elements as W because all the elements are real. So W^dagger is the same as W. So W is Hermitian. Oh, wait, but for W to be unitary, W*W† should be identity. Wait, no, unitary would require W† W = I. Let me compute W squared. Hmm, maybe not necessary right now.

Matrix X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Wait, the elements have complex numbers. Let me check if X is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of X would be:

For the (1,1) element, it's -i (since i's conjugate is -i), then (1,2) becomes -1, (1,3) becomes -2i. Hmm, wait, the conjugate of X's (1,1) is -i. So the first row of X† is [-i, 1, -2i]. Wait, let's do it properly.

X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† would be the conjugate transpose. So the first column of X is the first row of X† and take the complex conjugate.

So X† is:

Row 1: [ -i, 1, -2i ]
Row 2: [ -1,
