Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary systems are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And the question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor.

So the problem says that system_1 and system_2 have periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses, which I think relates to how long it takes for the stars to orbit each other. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2.

Then, there's spectroscopic observations about radial velocities (RVs). For system_1, the RVs have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. So I guess these amplitudes are the maximum velocities each star moves towards or away from us. 

I remember that in binary systems, the more massive star has a smaller orbit because the center of mass is closer to the more massive one. But wait, the RV amplitude depends on the mass of the companion and the orbit's size. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some formula. Let me try to recall. I think the formula relates the velocity amplitude to the mass of the companion and the system's period.

The formula I remember is K = (v) = (2πG / (P * c^3))^(1/3) * (M sin i) / (1 + M/m) ), but I might be mixing up some terms. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think about the relationship between the velocities of the two stars. In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. That is, if M and m are the masses, then M * v_M = m * v_m. So the product of mass and velocity is the same for both stars.

Wait, but in RV observations, the amplitude is the maximum velocity each star has. So for system_1, let's say the two stars have velocities K1a =10 km/s and K1b=5 km/s. Then, their masses should be related as M1a / M1b = K1b / K1a. So M1a is twice M1b because 5/10 is 0.5, so M1a is twice as much as M1b.

Same for system_2: K2a=15, K2b=10. So M2a/M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a is 2/3 of M2b, meaning M2b is 1.5 times M2a.

But wait, the total mass of each system is the sum of the two stars. So for system_1: M1 = M1a + M1b. Since M1a is twice M1b, M1a = 2*M1b. So M1 = 2*M1b + M1b = 3*M1b. Similarly, for system_2: M2 = M2a + M2b. And since M2a is 2/3 of M2b, M2a = (2/3) M2b. So M2 = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But wait, how does this relate to the periods? Because the period for each system is given. I think the period is the same for both stars in a binary system, which makes sense because they're orbiting each other with the same period.

I also remember that Kepler's third law relates the period and the masses. The formula for binary stars is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. Hmm, but how does that tie into the velocities?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The velocity of each star in the binary can be related to the orbital period and the size of their orbits. The total separation a is a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the distances from each star to the center of mass. So a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a, and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a. 

The velocity of each star is v = 2π a_i / P, where a_i is their orbit radius and P is the period. So v1 = 2π a1 / P and v2 = 2π a
