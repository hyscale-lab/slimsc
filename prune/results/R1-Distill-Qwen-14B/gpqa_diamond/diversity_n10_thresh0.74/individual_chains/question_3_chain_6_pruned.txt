Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. And the question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. 

Wait, expectation value calculation. Right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute the expectation for each part and then sum them.

First, let's break down the operator. 10σz +5σx. Since expectation is linear, I can compute each part separately and add them.

Let me write the state vector ψ. It's given as (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So in vector form, since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, let me double-check the components. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Oh wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. But since the components need to be normalized, let's check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1. Oh right, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator 10σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, calculating the expectation of σz is straightforward. 

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So, the expectation value of σz is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Wait, let's compute that:

(0.5)^2 = 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So 0.2
