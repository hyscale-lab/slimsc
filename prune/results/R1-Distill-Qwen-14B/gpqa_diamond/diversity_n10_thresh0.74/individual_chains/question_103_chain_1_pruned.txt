Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is acetophenone, so the structure would have a ketone group (COCH3) attached to a benzene ring that also has bromine and nitro groups in specific positions.

First, I need to plan the synthesis step by step. The target molecule has substituents at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring. Since nitro groups are meta directors and bromine is a ortho/para director, I need to think about the order of adding these groups to get them in the correct positions.

Benzene is the starting material. I'll probably need to perform several substitution reactions, each time activating the ring appropriately. Let's think about the substituents: a nitro group, a bromine, and a ketone group (from acetophenone).

Wait, the ketone is a meta director. But if I add that after the nitro and bromine, maybe it's easier. Alternatively, adding the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone. But I'm not sure. Let's see.

Nitration is a strong activating reaction, so if I nitrify benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps a substitution reaction to add Br. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent (like Br) would go in the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so let me think. Suppose I nitrate first, then brominate. Nitro group is at position 1, bromine would be at position 3 (since meta to nitro). Then, if I add the ketone group (like via Friedel-Crafts acetylation), where would that go? Friedel-Crafts is for activating rings, but nitro is deactivating. Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, so if the ring is deactivated by nitro groups, it won't undergo Friedel-Crafts. Hmm, so maybe I need to add the ketone before the nitro group.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acetylation (using CH3COCl and AlCl3) requires the ring to be activated, so if I do that first, then I can have the ketone group in place. Then, after that, the ring is deactivating because ketones are meta directors and deactivating. So when adding nitro groups and bromine, they would be directed accordingly.

Wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenylacetophenone. So the positions are 3-bromo, 5-nitro, and 1-ketone (since the ketone is attached directly to the benzene). Wait no, ethan-1-one is R-CO-CH3, so the acetophenone would be attached at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and nitro.

So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So it's a 1,3,
