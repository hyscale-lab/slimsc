Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which undergoes several transformations leading to Compound D. I need to figure out what D is from the given options.

Starting with Compound A: It has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, that NMR data must indicate some kind of structure.

I remember that in NMR, the splitting (multiplicity) and integration can tell us about the neighboring protons. So a triplet with 6H and a quartet with 4H. Let me think about possible structures.

A triplet for 6H suggests that these protons are equivalent and each is split into a triplet, which would mean each is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Maybe these are CH2 groups attached to something. Wait, 6H as a triplet—could it be two equivalent CH2CH3 groups? Because each CH3 would split into a triplet if next to a CH2.

If that's the case, the triplet would be from two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H might be the adjacent CH2 groups. Because a quartet (which is splitting into four peaks) suggests each proton is next to three equivalent protons. Wait, but 4H as a quartet—if each of the two CH2 groups is next to another CH2, maybe a -CH2-CH2- structure. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's longer. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane or something else.

Wait, another thought: For a triplet of 6H, maybe it's two equivalent CH2CH3 groups attached to a central CH2. So the structure could be CH2(C H2CH3)2. That would give each CH3 next to the CH2, leading to a triplet. The CH2 would have neighboring CH3 groups, but wait, each CH2 in the middle would have two CH3 groups, each contributing to splitting. Wait, no, the CH2 in
