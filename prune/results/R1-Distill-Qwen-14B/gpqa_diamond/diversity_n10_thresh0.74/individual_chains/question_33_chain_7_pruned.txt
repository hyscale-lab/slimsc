Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are pericyclic reactions, right? The [4+2] is a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the question is about an exo product. Oh right, in Diels-Alder, the endo rule says that the more substituted product is favored, but exo is the opposite.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. So, let me think about their structures. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur; 2,5-dimethyl would have methyl groups on carbons 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another five-membered ring, but it's a furan with two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 5. So both are dienophiles? Or wait, in Diels-Alder, one is the diene and the other is the dienophile.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction is between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, which is usually electron-deficient. So the diene is the one with the conjugated double bonds, and the dienophile is something like a ketone, ester, or something that's electron-deficient.

So, looking at the two molecules: 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene itself is aromatic, but 2,5-dimethylthiopheneâ€”does that have conjugated double bonds? Thiophene has conjugated double bonds, so perhaps it can act as a diene? Or maybe the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile?

Wait, furan-2,5-dione. Furan is a diene itself, but with the two ketone groups, it's more likely to be a dienophile. Because the ketone groups make it electron-deficient. So, perhaps the 2,5-dimethylthiophene is the diene, and the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (electron-deficient). So 2,5-dimethylthi
