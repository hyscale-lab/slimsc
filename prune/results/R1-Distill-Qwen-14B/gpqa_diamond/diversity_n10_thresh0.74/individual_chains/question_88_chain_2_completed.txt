Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about some biology process happening with rotavirus and mice. Hmm.

Okay, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice via oral gavage. Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. But then, they found fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing their variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. The question is, which process is happening?

I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they're involved in immune responses, especially against pathogens entering through the gastrointestinal tract. So, the GFP-tagged proteins probably made it to the Peyer's patches, where immune cells process them.

The variable heavy chain gene having high variability makes me think of something that happens during an immune response. The immune system needs diversity in antibodies to recognize different antigens. So, what processes create this diversity?

Let's look at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is when mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptors during the immune response. It increases diversity after the initial VDJ recombination. This process happens in germinal centers, leading to affinity maturation.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination (CSR): This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't create new variable regions. It's more about function.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's the initial process that creates the diversity of the variable regions by shuffling V, D, and J segments. But if this happened, the variability would be set during B cell development, not in response to a specific antigen.

Wait, but the question is about what's happening after the GFP-tagged proteins were given. The cells are proliferating in Peyer's patches, which I think are where B cells are activated. So, when B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo somatic hypermutation in the germinal centers, increasing the diversity of their antibodies. That would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

So the process is probably somatic hypermutation, which is option A. Because during this process, the genes are mutated, leading to more varied B cell receptors, which is what they observed.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is observed in Peyer's patches, and sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells in these patches reveals high variability. The task is to identify the process responsible for this variability.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are involved in immune responses to pathogens. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors during the immune response, increasing diversity. It occurs in germinal centers and is consistent with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not create new variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity. However, it happens earlier in B cell maturation and does not explain the observed variability in response to the GFP-tagged proteins.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating cell population in Peyer's patches is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to antigens like the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins. This process increases antibody diversity to improve antigen recognition and affinity.

Answer: A
