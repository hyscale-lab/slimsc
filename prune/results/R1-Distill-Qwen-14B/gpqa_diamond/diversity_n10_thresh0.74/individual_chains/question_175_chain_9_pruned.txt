Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiation zone and the power radiated at a specific angle.

Alright, the problem says that the charge distribution is oscillating, so it must be emitting electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f that depends on the wavelength λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. They're asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of λ.

Wait, I remember that for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern has a specific angular dependence. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation is stronger along the equatorial plane (θ = 90 degrees) compared to the polar directions (θ = 0 or 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is symmetric about the equatorial plane, and the intensity varies with θ as something like sin²θ or cosθ. Let me think.

Wait, the power radiated per unit solid angle (which is the intensity) for a dipole varies with θ as (1 + cos²θ) or something like that. Oh wait, no, actually, the radiation pattern of a dipole is given by the formula I(θ) proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but wait, no, wait. No, I think it's more like (3/(4π)) * ( (sinθ)^2 ) divided by something. Hmm, maybe I should get this right.

Wait, let me recall. The radiation from a dipole is maximum at θ = 90 degrees because the dipole's field is strongest perpendicular to its axis. The intensity pattern has a maximum at 90 degrees. The formula, I think, is something like ( sin²θ ) because the maximum is when sinθ is 1, which is at 90 degrees. So for a dipole, the intensity as a function of θ is proportional to sin²θ.

But wait, another way to think about it: the power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is given by I(θ) = ( (μ₀ μ² ω⁴ )/( 12π c³
