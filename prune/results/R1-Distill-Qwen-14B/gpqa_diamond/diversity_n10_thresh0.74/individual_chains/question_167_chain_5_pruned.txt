Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The state is given as |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>) / N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). The relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state and rho is the non-Gaussian state.

The task is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options are A to D, with some numerical values.

Wait a second, I remember that Gaussian states are usually coherent states or similar, and non-Gaussian states have more complex structures like cat states. The non-Gaussianity here is measured using relative entropy, which compares the given state's entropy with that of a Gaussian reference.

So, the formula for del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state rho and the Gaussian state tau. But wait, no, the relative entropy measure here is the difference of their entropies. Alternatively, relative entropy usually refers to Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). But the formula given here is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Oh, so it's the difference of their individual entropies, not the KL divergence.

Wait, but the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is often defined as S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, maybe in some sense. Or perhaps here they've simplified it by subtracting the Gaussian entropy from the non-Gaussian.

But I'm a bit confused about the exact definition. Alternatively, perhaps the formula given is the correct one for this problem. So I'll proceed with what's given.

First, I need to find rho, the density matrix of the given state. The state |ψ> is (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α> ) / N. Since it's a pure state, rho is |ψ><ψ|.
