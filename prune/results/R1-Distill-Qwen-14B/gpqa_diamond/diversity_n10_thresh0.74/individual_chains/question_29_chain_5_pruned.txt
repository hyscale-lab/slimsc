Okay, so I have this genetics question about mutations in a gene that leads to an anti-nutritional compound in barley. I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate that compound. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the gene has five exons and four introns. The problem is about a mutation in the first exon area. The goal is to find a mutation that would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, I think I should compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene. The anti-nutritional compound is caused by the gene's product, so if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound might not be produced.

The wild type sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type. Let me see where they differ. The wild type's first part is ATGTTTCTC... In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTA. So at position 4-7, wild type has TTT C, and mutant has TCT A. Wait, perhaps I should count the differences.

Wait, maybe I should write the sequences aligned:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the sequences start to differ. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact point of mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for changes that cause a frameshift or a stop codon.

Wait, another approach: since the question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound, it's likely a nonsense mutation (creates a stop codon) or a frameshift that leads to a truncated protein.

Looking at each mutant's first exon changes, let's see:

Mutant 1: The sequence in the first exon is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Wait, let's compare to the wild type:

Wild type first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1's first part: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Hmm, perhaps there's a substitution. Let me look for where the wild type and mutant 1 differ.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, let me count the nucleotides:

Wild type starts with ATG TTT CTC G
