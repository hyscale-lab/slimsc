Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-Î²E), where E is the energy of each state. Let me try to break this down.

The spins are S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Wait, but I've heard sometimes about considering all possible combinations, so I should list them all maybe?

The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. Oh right, each term is the product of two spins. So the energy depends on how many pairs are aligned (like, same spin) versus anti-aligned.

But wait, J is a coupling constant. I think if J is positive, it's ferromagnetic and lower energy when spins are aligned. If J is negative, anti-ferromagnetic. But for the partition function, the sign of J will affect the energies, so I need to consider that.

Wait, the problem says each spin can be +1 or -1. So each of the three spins can be in two states. So the states are all possible combinations of +1 and -1 for the three spins. Let me list them.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Since the energy depends on the sum of S_i S_j, perhaps the number of aligned pairs (each S_i S_j = +1 if aligned, -1 otherwise) can determine the energy.

Each S_i S_j is 1 if the two spins are the same, -1 if different. So for each term in the energy expression, if two spins are aligned, that term contributes +1, else -1.

The energy E is then -J multiplied by the sum. So let's see, how many terms in the sum? There are three terms: S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. So the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think: for each state (each possible combination of +1 and -1), the sum can be 3, 1, or -1, right? Because each term can be +1 or -1.

Wait, let me think: Each pair can be aligned or not. Let's say all three pairs are aligned. Then each term is +1, so sum is 3. Then E = -J * 3.

Alternatively, two pairs are aligned, one anti-aligned. So sum is +1 +1 -1 = 1. So E = -J *1.

Or one pair aligned, two anti-aligned. Sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, J is a constant. So I need to compute E for each possible state.

Wait, another approach: for each state, compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, then multiply by -J
