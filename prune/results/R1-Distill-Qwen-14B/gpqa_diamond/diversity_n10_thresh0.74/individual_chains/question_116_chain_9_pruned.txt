Alright, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, okay, so the question is about organic chemistry, specifically NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question describes compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Oh right, NMR signals give information about the structure. So, 0.9 ppm for six hydrogens—triplet. That makes me think of something like two equivalent methyl groups attached to a CH2. Because, in such a case, the CH2 next to the methyls would show up as a triplet. The integrating for 6H suggests maybe two CH3 groups.

Then, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet indicates splitting into four peaks, which usually comes from coupling with a CH2 group. Because each of the two neighboring protons would split the signal. So maybe a -CH2-CH2- group. But wait, 4H would make sense if it's a CH2CH2 group, like two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but wait—another possibility: maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 with two protons each. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2-CH2- structure but no, that would have more H's. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane ring? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group.

Wait, putting it together: the triplet for 6H (two CH3 groups) and quartet for 4H (a CH2CH2 group). So perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2? No, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, wait—if the triplet is 6H, that's two CH3 groups, each with 3H. So each of those would be attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2 with two CH3 groups attached. Wait, maybe like diethyl ether? No, that's OCH2CH3, which would have different NMR signals.

Wait, but considering the integration: 6H and 4H. So the molecule probably has two methyl groups and a butyl chain? Maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, wait
