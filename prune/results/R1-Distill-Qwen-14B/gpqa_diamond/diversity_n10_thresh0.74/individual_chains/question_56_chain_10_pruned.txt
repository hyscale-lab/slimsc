Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. The options are about the route and the probability.

Wait, I remember that in hydrogen atom transitions, electrons can't just drop from a higher energy level to a lower one directly if there's a possibility to go through intermediate steps. Oh right, it's about selection rules. Dipole transitions follow certain selection rules.

So for dipole transitions, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Right, so the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, 1, or -1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So n goes from 3 to 1, which is a drop of 2. Since each dipole transition can only change l by 1, the electron can't go from l=0 to l=0 in one step. It has to go through an intermediate state where l changes.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The first transition must change l from 0 to 1 because Δl=±1. So the first transition is to n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1, or ∓1. Wait, let me think. The m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, m can go to 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, so the first step from |3,0,0> could be to |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>.

Then, from the intermediate state, we need to transition to |1,0,0>. So, let's think about the second transition. From l=1, the next transition must change l by ±1. Since the final l is 0, that's a Δl of -1. So from l=1, you can go to l=0.

So for the second transition, the state must have l=1 and m such that m can go to 0 (since the final state is m=0). So let's see each possibility.

If the first step was to |2,1,1>, then in the second step, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So m=1 can go to m=0, 1, or 2. Wait, but the final state is m=0. So for a transition from m=1 to m=0, that's a Δm of -1. Is that allowed? Yes, because Δm can be -1.

Similarly, if the first step was to |2,1,0>, then the second transition must have m=0. So m can change to m= 0, ±1. So from m=0, you can go to m=0, +1, or -1. The final state is m=0, so that's allowed.

Wait, but the question says it's a two-step dipole transition, so the process has to go through an intermediate state. So the possible intermediates are |2,1,m>, where m is 0, 1, or -1.

Now, the options are about the transition route and the probability. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option B: →2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C: →2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option D: →2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 2/3.

Wait, but each transition's probability would be a factor. The total probability would be the product of the two transition probabilities.

But how do we find the probabilities for each transition step?

I remember that the transition probability depends on the square of the matrix element for the dipole transition. The matrix element is proportional to <f| r |i>, where r is the dipole operator.

But for specific l and m values, certain transitions are more probable. Alternatively, I think the probability is also influenced by the number of possible paths.

Wait, another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0> would be to any |2,1,m> state, and then from there to |1,0,0>.

Each of these first-step transitions will have their own probabilities. But how many possible intermediates are there? From |3,0,0>, you can go to |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>. So three possibilities.

Each of these would have a certain probability. Then, from each intermediate state, how many ways are there to get to |1,0,0>?

From |2,1,1>, the possible second transitions would be to m=0,1,2. But the final state is m=0. So for each intermediate, only one of the possible m transitions would lead to the desired state.

Wait, but from |2,1, m>, to reach |1,0,0>, the m must change by -m. Because the final m is 0.

So for each first transition, the second transition must have the right m change.

Let me think in terms of possible paths:

Path 1: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0.

Path 2: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0 (m goes from 1 to 0).

Path 3: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0 (m goes from -1 to 0).

So there are three possible paths. Each path has its own probability.

But what's the probability for each individual transition?

The probability amplitude for each step is given by the dipole matrix element. The square of that gives the probability.

The matrix element <f | e r | i> is proportional to the integral of Y_{l',m'}^* r Y_{l,m}.

For each transition, the matrix element's magnitude depends on the angular parts.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1,m'}, so the matrix element for |n'l'm'> from |n l m> is proportional to the integral of Y_{l', m'}^* (r Y_{1, m''}) Y_{l, m}.

But perhaps a quicker way is to remember that the probability depends on the number of ways the angular momentum can change. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I think the probability for each first transition (from 3,0,0 to 2,1,m) is the same for each m, since they're symmetric. So from 3,0,0, the probability to go to each of the three possible 2,1,m states is the same.

Similarly, from each 2,1,m state, the probability to go to 1,0,0 is the same for each m?

Wait, no. Because the transition from 2,1,1 to 1,0,0 requires m to go from 1 to 0. That's Δm = -1.

Similarly, from 2,1,0 to 1
