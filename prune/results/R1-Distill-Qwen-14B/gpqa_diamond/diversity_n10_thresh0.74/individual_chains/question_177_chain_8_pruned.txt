Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming the stars radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ is inversely proportional to T. Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, no, wait a minute. Because the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply that they have the same temperature. Because Wien's law is λ_max ∝ 1/T. So same λ_max implies same T.

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait. Because the stars have different velocities, could that affect their observed wavelengths? Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect. The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (or away, depending on the sign), its light would be Doppler shifted.

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_1 is stationary relative to us, I suppose, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the question is, does the Doppler shift affect the observed wavelength, which would then affect how we perceive the star's peak emission?

But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, even though they have different velocities, after accounting for redshift or blueshift, their observed λ_max is the same. So the actual emitted λ_max (from their rest frames) must be different. Because when you shift the observed λ, it's due to their velocities. So perhaps I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, let's think. Let's denote Star_1 as S1 and Star_2 as S2.

S1 has radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s. So its observed λ is the same as the emitted λ. S2 has v2 = 700 km/s. But the problem states that the observed λ_max for both stars are the same. So, let me model this.

The emitted λ for each star is λ_emitted = λ_observed × sqrt( [1 + v/c] / [1 - v/c] )
