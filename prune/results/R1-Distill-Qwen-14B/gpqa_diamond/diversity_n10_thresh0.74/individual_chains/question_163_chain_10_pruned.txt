Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We’re supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare this solution, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, right? So when it's dissolved in an acid, it should react. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl or HNO3, probably. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions to produce Fe^3+ and water.

Let me write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so it would react with a strong acid. The balanced equation should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Right, that makes sense. So the acid provides H+ ions, and each mole of Fe(OH)3 would consume 3 moles of H+.

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... let's calculate that. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3*(O + H) = 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, 16 (O) + 1 (H) is 17 per OH- group, and there are three, so yeah, 3*17=51, plus 55.85 gives 106.85 g/mol.

So the moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. The mass is 0.1 grams. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately.

Let's compute 0.1 / 106.85. Let me think. 106.85 is approximately 100, so 0.001 mol would be 100 g, but it's 0.1 g, so 0.001 * (0.1/106.85) → wait, wait, wait. 0.1 / 106.85 = approx 9.36e-4 moles, right? Because 106.85 * 0.000936 is approx 0.1.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.000936 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:3, the H+ required is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so concentration is 0.1 mol per liter (which is 1000 cm³). So to find the volume needed, V = moles / concentration. So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the options given are A) 32.14... B) 30.09... C) 28.05... D) 20.40.
