Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on three different spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. My job is to figure out which one is the correct formula.

First, I'll break down each piece of information provided and see what they can tell me about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups. Broad peaks in IR usually mean hydrogen bonding, so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak around 2500-3300. But the peak here is at 3000, which could also be from an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether? No, because ethers don't have O-H bonds. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, the FTIR also has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is strong for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings (like in benzene) have absorption around 1600, so 1650 might be a carbonyl with conjugation, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl group, maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. The problem states that there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has at least one double bond, possibly in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring (but aromatic protons usually appear in different regions). Wait, but the question says "vinyl hydrogens
