Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, I remember that this is the potential for a harmonic oscillator. So the force acting on the particle follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kr, and in this case, k would be m ω². So the system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

I think I should first recall how the energy levels work in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In one dimension, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). 

But in three dimensions, it's a bit different. Since the problem is isotropic, the potential is the same in all three directions, so the energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. So the total energy E would be the sum of the three individual energies: E = E_x + E_y + E_z. Each E is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i are the quantum numbers for each direction.

Alternatively, another way to look at it is that in 3D, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Because each of the three directions contributes a 1/2 ħω, so together they add up to 3/2 ħω, plus each n_i contributes (n_i) ħω.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each direction has its own (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So N is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy levels are spaced by increasing N. Each level corresponds to a certain N, and the degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) is related to how many ways you can sum n_x, n_y, n_z to get N.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is the lowest energy,
