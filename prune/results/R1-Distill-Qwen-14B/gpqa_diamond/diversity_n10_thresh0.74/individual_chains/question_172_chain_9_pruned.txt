Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, the number of atoms in an excited state compared to a lower energy state. So if the energy levels are E2 and E1 with E2 > E1, the ratio of their populations would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Since the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, I think that the ratio for star_1 is n1_2/n1_1 = 2, and for star_2 it's n2_2/n2_1 = some other value. Wait, wait, actually, the ratio should be n_upper/n_lower. So let's clarify: for star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So in star 1, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is 2, and in star 2, it's 1 (because twice as much in
