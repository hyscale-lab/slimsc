Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one.

Alright, the setup: Two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Interesting.

Wait, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. But both stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So, same radius but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star, and the orbital distance. The formula, I think, is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (d/(a)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh wait, the transit probability formula is more about how likely the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on from our perspective.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, I think the formula is more precise. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a * (1 + (M_p/(M_s + M_p))^(1/3)) )) or something like that. No, maybe not. Alternatively, I think the main factors are the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Because the probability of transit is roughly (R_* ) / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5 ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero so that term is 1. So the probability is proportional to (R_* ) / a.

Wait, no, wait. The probability of transit is given by (R_* + R_p) / a, but since Earth-like planets have much smaller radii than stars, R_p is negligible. So it's approximately R_* / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_*) / a.

Wait, but the formula I've read before is P â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet)^(2/
