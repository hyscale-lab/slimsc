Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. I need to identify E based on the given information and the options provided.

First, let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form Compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form Compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form Compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form Compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) When Compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is strong around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different cyclic ketones.

Hmm, I think I should start by analyzing the hints, especially hint a), which mentions a reaction with a phosphorous ylide. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product from the ylide reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse the structure.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group attached as a substituent. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group like CH2-C(CH3)= something? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene would be =CHCH(CH3), I think. Wait, no, the structure of a Wittig ylide is usually (R2P=CH-R'), so when it reacts, it forms an alkene. So the product would have a double bond.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, maybe the propan-2-ylidene is part of the double bond. Let me think, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent attached to the cyclopentane via a double bond. So the structure would be a cyclopentane ring with a substituent at position 4. That substituent is a group that has a double bond: propan-2-ylidene would be something like CH(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe (CH3)2C=CH- attached.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituent at C4 is propan-2-ylidene, which is an allyl group
