Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. Let me read through the question again.

The question is asking about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of substituting groups is important because of the directing effects of the substituents.

Let me break down the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. I need to figure out where each substituent is attached.

Looking at the numbering, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, actually, wait: benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me imagine the structure.

Let's say the benzene ring is numbered such that the ethoxy group is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Alternatively, perhaps it's meta, para, etc. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. So, for benzene, substituting groups can be ortho, meta, para relative to each other.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the order in which substituents are added. Each substitution directs where the next substituent will go.

Let me think about the substituents' directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are activating and ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is activating and ortho/para director.

Wait, wait. No, wait: nitro is deactivating (meta), ethoxy is activating (ortho/para), and tert-butyl is activating (ortho/para) as well.

So, the challenge is to get the substituents in the correct positions.

I think the key is the order of nitration, alkylation, and ethoxylation, but maybe not. Wait, what's the target molecule's substituents?

Wait, the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.

So, the order of substitution matters a lot. Each substituent adds after the previous ones, so each directs where the next will go.

Let me think about the steps involved. The steps likely involve Friedel-Crafts alkylation, nitration, sulfonation, etc.

Wait, let's think about the target: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as being in the order of nitro, ethoxy, tert-butyl, or another order.

Wait, but let's think about which substituent is added first. For example, if I add nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl, would that give the right positions?

Wait, no, because nitro is a deactivating group. Once added,
