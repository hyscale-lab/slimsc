Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Let me read through the problem again and break it down.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and the researcher is using a bicistronic vector to study their interaction. The vector has two ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. There are some stop cassettes and loxP sites involved.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the receptor in a different way, maybe allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed from the same vector.

But wait, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop with loxP, and the receptor ORF has a stop with lox2272. So, without Cre, the stop is in place, preventing expression of the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP). When Cre is introduced, it should recombine the lox sites, removing the stops, allowing the fluorescent tags to be expressed.

The researcher made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would probably be active in neural crest cells, which express the ligand and receptor.

The offspring were born, and they looked under the confocal for green signal. They didn't see any green. The question is why.

The options are A to D. Let's consider each possibility.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, then maybe the eGFP (on the receptor) wouldn't be expressed in the same cell. But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are in the same construct. If both are expressed in the same cells, then the same cell would have both. Unless the ligand is secreted, so the receptors would be on other cells. But the question is about eGFP expression, which would be in the same cell if the Cre is active. So I'm not sure how this would directly explain the lack of green signal. Maybe in paracrine, the ligand is elsewhere, but the receptor wouldn't be expressed? Hmm, not sure. Maybe this isn't the main issue here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't getting secreted or properly trafficked, maybe it doesn't show up. But eGFP is a fluorescent protein, so if the receptor is properly trafficked, the GFP should be visible. Unless the construct is retained in the ER or Golgi. But the problem states that the researcher checked Western blot and found no signal, which would suggest the protein isn't being made. Wait, no, because the Western blot was after transfecting into primary astrocytes. Wait, no, the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture, they used the antibodies on Western blot. So in that case, if the stop cassettes are not recombined, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the mouse model, they used a different setup, perhaps with Cre, which should remove the stops. Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so Cre would be required to excise the stops. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would presumably activate the expression in neural crest-derived cells.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The bicistronic vector: the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop with loxP. Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. When Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites, removing the stops. So, CBA promoter drives the ligand, which is followed by a stopâ€”so without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry isn't. Because the stop is before mCherry. Similarly, for the receptor, the IRES would allow the receptor and eGFP to be expressed only after the lox2272 stop is removed.

Wait, wait. The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one transcript. The first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and then the second ORF (receptor) is under the control of an IRES, which allows for translation without another round of transcription.

So when Cre is present, the lox sites are recombined. For the ligand, the stop cassette is between ligand and mCherry. So, the ligand would be expressed, and the stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed as well. Similarly, the receptor's stop is between the receptor and eGFP.

But in the mouse model, they're using the SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So in cells where Cre is active, the loxP and lox2272 sites should be recombined, removing the stops. So in those cells, both mCherry and eGFP should be
