Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think it through.

So, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux1/flux2.

First, I should remember what the pp-III branch does. The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II goes to helium-3, and the pp-III branch combines two helium-3 nuclei to make helium-4, releasing more energy. Oh wait, but neutrinos are produced in different steps. The main neutrinos are from the decay of beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle, but wait, noâ€”actually, the majority of solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-III branch. Oh right, because the pp-III branch produces the most neutrinos. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In the pp chain, the dominant neutrino production comes from the decay of the intermediate particles. I think the main source is the beta decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-III reactions. Boron-8 has a half-life of about 19 minutes, and it decays into lithium-8, emitting a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, that source of neutrinos would be cut off.

Wait, but the question says all other reactions remain the same. So other branches like the CNO cycle and maybe the pp-I and pp-II are still going on. But wait, the CNO cycle is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy, right? So the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp chain, specifically the pp-III branch.

So if pp-III stops, the production of boron-8, which decays into neutrinos, would stop. But the decay process takes some time. The boron-8 has a half-life of about 20 minutes, I believe. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, how much boron-8 is left?

Let me calculate. The half-life is about 19 minutes. So 8.5 minutes is roughly a quarter of
