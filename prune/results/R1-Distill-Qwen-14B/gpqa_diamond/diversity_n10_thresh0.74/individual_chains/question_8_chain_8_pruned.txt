Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease in white lupine. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that they did an experiment to find genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. They found three genes, G1, G2, G3, and made knockout mutants. They also made double mutants. The key point is that at least one of these is a transcription factor upstream of others. The question is about figuring out the interactions based on the resistance levels.

The results are given as percentages of resistance. Wild-type is 100%, so higher means better resistance. The mutants:

- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild-type.
- g2: 0% → no resistance.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → very low.
- g2g3: 0% → no resistance.
- g1g2: 0% → no resistance.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what this tells us about the gene interactions. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, let's consider the single mutants. The g2 mutant is the most affected—zero resistance. So G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps the transcription factor since it's a single mutant with no resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable a whole pathway, making the plant unable to resist the disease. That makes sense because transcription factors regulate other genes.

Looking at the double mutants: when G2 is knocked out (g2), any double mutant with g2 (like g1g2, g2g3) is 0%—so the g2 mutation is epistatic. Epistasis means that the phenotype of one mutation masks the other. So in g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. So the presence of g2 mutation is masking the effect of the other mutations. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3 or that G2 is epistatic to both.

Now, G1 and G3's single mutants have lower resistance but not zero. So in g1, 75%—so the plant is less resistant but still has some. g3 is 50%—so even less. Now, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%—much worse than either single mutant. So this suggests that G1 and G3 might work in parallel pathways. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is even lower than either single. That could mean that they contribute additively—like redundancy or a gene network where each can compensate a bit.

Wait, but another possibility is that they function in the same pathway, but then knocking both out would be more severe. But in this case, it's worse than either single. So perhaps they function in separate pathways, and each contributes some level of resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes a part, then knocking both out would make it worse. But if they're redundant, then knocking both out would be as bad as knocking out either. But here, g1g3 is worse than both, so maybe they're not redundant.

Wait, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2 is 0%: as expected because g2 is epistatic.
- g2g3 is 0%: same.
- g1g3 is 10%: worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each providing some resistance. So their combined knockout leads to lower resistance than either alone.

Now, let's think about epistasis. Epistatic relationships show where genes act in a pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, that means that A acts upstream of B. So knocking out A masks the effect of B.

Looking at the data, the g2 mutants are 0%, which is the most severe. So any double mutant including g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So this suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter what happens to G1 or G3—they can't compensate because G2 is upstream and without it, the pathway is broken.

So G2 is a transcription factor, acting upstream. So G2's product is necessary for the function of G1 and G3, or vice versa?

Wait, if G2 is upstream, then when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 can't function because the pathway is blocked before them. So in that case, the double mutants with G2 are as bad
