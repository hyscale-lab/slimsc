Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the question again? Oh right, it's asking where the given density matrix is located geometrically in the qubits space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me think about what this represents. I recall that a density matrix for a pure state is like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this one is a combination of two projectors. Oh wait, when you have equal probabilities for two states, like this, it's a mixed state. Specifically, this looks like a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ each with probability 1/2. So ρ is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mapping, but I remember that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. Each pure state |θ, φ⟩ corresponds to a point on this sphere. But wait, this isn't a pure state, it's a mixed state. How does that translate geometrically?

I think for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with components (x,y,z) such that |r| ≤ 1. The point r is the Bloch vector representing the state on the Bloch sphere.

So if I can express the given ρ in terms of this formula, I can find r. Let's expand the given ρ. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The terms |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are diagonal matrices. Let's compute each part.

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Therefore, ρ = (1/2)(I) because the sum is I.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, adding |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| gives I. So ρ is (1/2)I, because (1/2)(I) is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. But the general form for the density matrix using the Bloch vector is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So setting ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 equal to (I)/2, that implies r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So r·σ = 0. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

For r·σ to be zero, each component must be zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Wait, so the density matrix (I/2) corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere because it's the maximally mixed state. So the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which would be the answer. The other options seem to place the state on the surface or elsewhere, which would correspond to pure states or other mixed states. Oh yes, because pure states have |r|=1, and the completely mixed state is when r is zero, so the density matrix is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. The Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere, with \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\).

For the given \(\rho\), expanding \(|0\rangle \langle 0|\) and \(|1\rangle \langle 1|\) yields the identity matrix \(I\). Thus, the density matrix simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
