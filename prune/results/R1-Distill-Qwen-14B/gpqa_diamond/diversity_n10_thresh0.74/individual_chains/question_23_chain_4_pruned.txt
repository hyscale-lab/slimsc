Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide, HBr. After some time, the researcher checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had decreased, with two new spots formed. We need to figure out which products are formed.

First, I need to draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group, O-. The substituent attached to the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butene is four carbons. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait no, wait. Let me get that right. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, so the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, buten-3-en is actually CH2CH2CH=CH? No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, waitâ€”no. Wait, but but has four carbons. The positions are 1,2,3,4.

But-3-en-1-yl would be:
1   2   3   4
CH2-CH2-CH=CH2?

Wait, that's not possible because the double bond can't be between 3 and 4 in a four-carbon chain as that would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between 3-4, but that's only possible if it's CH2CH2CH=CH2, but then the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, but that would actually be
