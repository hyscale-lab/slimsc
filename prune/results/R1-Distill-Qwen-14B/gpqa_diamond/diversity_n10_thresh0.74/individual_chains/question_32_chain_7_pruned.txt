Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the atomic number for lithium is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons, which is 3 +3=6. So it's lithium-6, right? So X is a ^6Li nucleus.

The problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. The energy we're looking for is the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might just be referring to the kinetic energy. Wait, no, wait. The question says "the energy of the RHIC" so I think that refers to the total energy, gamma times the rest energy.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, given that the speed v is 0.96c, I need to compute gamma first.

Wait, let me compute gamma. So, v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 -
