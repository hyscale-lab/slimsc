Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on black hole thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. We need to find the entropy's order of magnitude.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find A first.

The area A depends on the radius of the event horizon. For a Schwarzschild black hole, the radius R is 2GM/c². But maybe I don't need to calculate M directly. Instead, I can find R using the angular size formula.

Angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to R/d when d is much larger than R, which it is for a distant galaxy. So θ ≈ R/d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. I should convert that to radians first. Oh right, because the formula for θ uses radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). 

Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is approximately (1e-17) * (π/180). Let me see, π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is about 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, since θ ≈ R/d, R = θ_rad * d. Oh wait, d is 1e10 parsecs. I should convert parsecs to meters because standard units for physics equations are meters, kilograms, etc. One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0
