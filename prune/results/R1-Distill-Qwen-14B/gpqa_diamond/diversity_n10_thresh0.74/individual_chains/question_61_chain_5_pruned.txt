Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Starting with benzene. The first reaction is treatment with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that this is a nitration reaction. Nitration typically adds a nitro group (-NO2) to benzene. But where does it add? Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and the nitronium ion is the electrophile. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. Wait, but if it's the first substitution, benzene doesn't have any substituents, so the nitro group can just enter anywhere. But wait, wait, when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitro group is usually added in a meta fashion, but wait, without any existing substituents, the nitro group can go at any position. Oh wait no, benzene is symmetric, so the product is just nitrobenzene, with the nitro group attached to one carbon, but it can be considered as para or meta in a way since all positions are equivalent initially. Hmm, but in reality, for nitration of benzene, the product is nitrobenzene, which is a single isomer because benzene is symmetric. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step, product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and Fe. Oh, that's a bromination reaction. Iron and bromine usually facilitate electrophilic substitution
