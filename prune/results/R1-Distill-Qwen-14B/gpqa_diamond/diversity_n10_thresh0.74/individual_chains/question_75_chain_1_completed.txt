Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. So, the setup is that they're using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to transfect a plasmid, and then selecting for antibiotic resistance. But the protein isn't being expressed as expected. 

The question gives the plus strand sequence of the construct. Let me look at that. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, Met. Then some other codons follow. Hmm, wait, I see a lot of CGs and Gs. But wait, the first part is 5' ATG TAC CC... So the start is ATG, then TAC is Tyr, then CCA is Pro, then TAC is Tyr again. 

Wait, but the plasmid was modified to include a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Oh, right, that's a fusion protein. So the first part of the protein should be HA, then followed by GADD45G.

Let me think about the reading frame. The HA tag is probably a short peptide, maybe like YPYDVPDYA or something similar. But in the given sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc. Let me see what those correspond to. TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr again. That would make the first three amino acids Tyr Pro Tyr. 

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is usually around 10 amino acids, starting with YPYDVPDYA. So the first few residues should be Tyr, Pro, Tyr, etc. But that's exactly what's in the sequence. So that's correct. So the HA tag is correctly included in the construct. 

So why isn't the protein being expressed? The options are:

A) Missense mutation in the HA sequence.
B) Ribosome terminated early.
C) No linker causing proteolysis.
D) No tRNA for UAA in mouse.

Wait, the plasmid uses a mouse coding sequence, right? Because the construct is for a mouse model. So let me look at the end of the sequence. The sequence ends with ...TGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for the stop codon. The last few codons before the end. Let me look for TGA, TAG, or TAA, which are the stop codons in mRNA. 

Looking at the end, the last part is ... GCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Breaking that down into codons. Let's see:

... GCT G TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC C GAG CGT TAA CGA TGG TGC TGC CAG C ATC ACC TCC CCG AGT GA.

Wait, the last part is CGA TGG TGC TGC CAG C ATC ACC TCC CCG AGT GA.

Hmm, the last few codons before the end are AGT GA. Wait, the original DNA is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be complementary. Let me think about that.

Wait, DNA is plus strand 5' to 3', so the mRNA is synthesized as complementary, so the mRNA would be 3' to 5' of the plus strand. So the mRNA would start with AUG (from ATG), then the codons follow.

The last part of the plus strand is ... TGA ... Wait, wait, the last codon in the plus strand is TGA. Because the plus strand ends with ...GCGAGTGA3'. So the DNA codon is TGA.

But wait, in DNA, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA except T for U. So the last codon in the plus (coding) strand is TGA. So in the mRNA, it would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but in the construct, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and then GADD45G. So the HA tag should be at the start, followed by the rest of the protein. So the GADD45G gene would end with its own stop codon.

Wait, but in the provided DNA sequence, the last codon is TGA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation at that point.

But if the HA tag is at the beginning, and then the GADD45G coding sequence, but the entire construct ends with a stop codon, then the protein would be HA followed by the rest of GADD45G up to that stop codon. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, maybe the construct doesn't have an internal ribosome entry site or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong frame, causing the ribosome to stop early.

Looking at the sequence, the HA tag starts at the beginning. Let's count the nucleotides. The HA tag is usually about 30 nucleotides (10 amino acids). Let me see. The start is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, the first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop). Wait, that's after 12 codons. But the HA tag is usually longer. Hmm, perhaps the HA sequence is correct, but the stop codon comes early, causing the HA to be truncated.

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, and the GADD45G coding sequence comes after. But in the provided construct, after the HA sequence, the next codons are part of GADD45G. But if the entire construct ends with TGA, then the GADD45G coding sequence is followed by a stop codon.

Wait, but the GADD45G gene's coding sequence should end with its own stop codon. So perhaps the construct includes the stop codon, but in the wrong place.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a frameshift or an early stop codon in the HA tag. Let me check the HA part again.

HA sequence is, for example, YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. So the DNA would be 30 bases. Let's see the initial part of the given sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, that's 12 codons. Wait, that's 36 nucleotides, so 12 codons. The HA tag is usually shorter than that. Wait, maybe the HA is only a few amino acids. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is correctly included, but the stop codon is in the middle of the HA, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, let's look at the first few codons again:

ATG (Met) â€“ start
TAC (Tyr)
CCA (Pro)
TAC (Tyr)
GAT (Asp)
GTT (Val)
CCA (Pro)
GAT (Asp)
TAC (Tyr)
GCC (Ala)
AAA (Lys)
TGA (stop)

So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Pro, Asp, Tyr, Ala, Lys. Then stop. So the HA tag is supposed to be longer. So the HA sequence ends with a stop codon in the middle, which is incorrect.

Wait, but that can't be right because the HA tag is supposed to be a fusion partner, so the GADD45G should be in frame and continue after the HA.

So perhaps the problem is that the HA sequence includes a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. So the HA is being made, but it's not the full length, and the rest of the GADD45G isn't made because the ribosome stops at TGA.

So the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence introduces a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the resulting protein would be truncated, only the HA part up to that stop.

But the construct was supposed to add the HA at the N-terminus, so the HA should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the HA's own sequence introduces a stop codon, then the fusion isn't happening. Instead, the protein stops at the HA, making a small peptide.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence is correct, but the construct includes an extra stop codon downstream. Wait, in the given DNA sequence, the last codon is TGA, which would be the end of the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the HA's own codons already included a stop, that would cause early termination.

Wait, looking again, the HA probably doesn't have a stop codon. Let me think about the HA sequence. For example, the HA tag is usually a short peptide without a stop codon. So in the construct, the HA should be in the same reading frame, followed by GADD45G, which has its own stop codon.

But in the provided DNA, the HA part is followed by the start of GADD45G, but before that, after the HA, there's a TGA in the HA part itself, causing the ribosome to stop early.

So the first 12 codons after ATG are part of the HA. But the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the HA is only 12 amino acids, but the HA tag is usually shorter, maybe 10-12. But more importantly, the HA should not include a stop codon. If it does, the protein would terminate there, not express the full-length GADD45G.

So the problem is that the HA sequence has a stop codon in it, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the GADD45G isn't expressed because the ribosome stops at the HA's TGA.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would fit.

Alternatively, option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in mouse. But wait, stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA. All three are recognized by the ribosome, and no tRNA can read them because they're stop signals. So the presence of a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence would cause termination.

So the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence includes a stop codon, causing early termination. So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but looking at the given DNA sequence, the TGA is in the plus strand, which would be UGA in the mRNA. So that's a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop at that point, leading to a truncated protein.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves identifying why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The construct includes a coding sequence for the GADD45G protein fused with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals that the first codon is ATG (start), followed by a series of codons corresponding to the HA tag. However, the 12th codon in the HA sequence is TGA, which is a stop codon (UGA in mRNA). This premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein that does not include the full-length GADD45G sequence. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is incorrect because the HA tag sequence appears to be correctly included in the construct, and the issue lies with the premature stop codon, not a mutation in the HA sequence.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct because the TGA codon in the HA sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length GADD45G protein from being expressed.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: This is incorrect because the issue is not proteolysis but rather premature termination of translation due to the stop codon.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is irrelevant because stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are not read by tRNAs; they signal ribosome termination. The presence of UGA in the mRNA is sufficient to terminate translation.

The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon in the HA sequence, leading to early ribosome termination. 

Answer: B
