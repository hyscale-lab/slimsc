Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis combined with a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis. Or wait, maybe it's the combination of a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane? I think C3h is part of the point group classification, right? So, the molecule should have a plane of symmetry that's horizontal, along with a three-fold axis. Alternatively, maybe it's a horizontal mirror plane with a three-fold axis perpendicular, but I'm not totally sure. I should double-check that.

Wait, let me think of the point groups. Oh right, the point group C3h consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any molecule with this symmetry should have both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or is it another combination? Maybe I should think about the structure of each compound and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I need to consider each structure.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the structure (i-Pr)3BO. The structure of isopropyl groups is symmetric. Each isopropyl group is like a CH(CH3)2. So, the molecule is (i-Pr)3BO. The central B atom is connected to three identical isopropyl groups. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. I think it might have a three-fold axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar around boron, which is in the center. So, the molecule is symmetric. Let's imagine the structure: B is at the center, with three i-
