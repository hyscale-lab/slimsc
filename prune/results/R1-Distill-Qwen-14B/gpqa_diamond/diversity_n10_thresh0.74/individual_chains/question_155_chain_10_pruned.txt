Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So I need to compute the uncertainty in P_z. Right, the uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z.

But first, I should probably write down the given matrices and the state vector. Let me jot that down.

The operator P_z has a matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix, which makes things easier because the basis vectors are its eigenvectors. That means the eigenstates of P_z are the basis vectors here.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2; (1/√2); -1/2 ].

So, to find ΔP_z, I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>, then take sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²).

Wait, but wait. Since the state is given, I can compute these expectations directly.

Let me compute <P_z> first. That's ψ† P_z ψ.

P_z is diagonal, so multiplying P_z by ψ would just scale each component. 

So, ψ is [ a; b; c ] where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So P_z ψ would be [ ħ*a; 0*b; (-ħ)*c ].

Then, ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since all elements are real, it's just [ a*, b*, c* ] = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Wait, but let me make sure. The state vector is given as a column vector, so when I take ψ†, it's a row vector with the conjugate of each element. Since all elements are real here, ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, <P_z> = ψ† P_z ψ.

P_z ψ is [ ħ*(-1/2), 0, (-ħ)*(-1/2) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then, ψ† (P_z ψ) is the dot product of [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] and [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].
