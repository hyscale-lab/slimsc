Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again.

The chemist found a white solid with some spectral data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the base peak at 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158, which is 32% of the base. The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm, a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H). The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let's break this down. Starting with the molecular formula, maybe? But wait, the molecular ion is at 156. What's the possible molecular formula? Let me think about the options. 

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and another OH. Wait, no, actually, let me get the formula right. Benzaldehyde is C7H7O, but when you substitute, adding Cl and OH would make it C7H5ClO2? Let me check: Benzaldehyde is C7H7O (if I'm not mistaken). Wait, no, benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's compute each option's molecular weight.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would replace a hydrogen, so molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight would be (12*7) + (5*1) + (35.5) + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, which is close to the molecular ion at 156. But wait, the molecular ion is 156, so maybe the actual formula is 156, so perhaps B is possible.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same molecular formula as B, so same molecular weightâ€”156.5. Hmm, but the
