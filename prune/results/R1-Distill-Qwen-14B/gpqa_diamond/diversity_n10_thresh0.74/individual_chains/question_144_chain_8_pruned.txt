Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all with different values in meters, so it's a calculation involving units.

I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. The basic idea is that the particle is moving, and the distance it travels before decaying is its velocity multiplied by its lifetime. So distance = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity and the lifetime? Let's think. The lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, but I think the exact formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy times uncertainty in time is around ħ.

But wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me recall: The mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame) is given by τ = ħ/(Γ). Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the rate of decay, so Γ = ħ/τ. Yeah, that makes sense. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should double-check the formula. Oh right, Γ is the decay rate, which is the total width. The mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. And ħ has units of GeV·seconds or something? Hmm, I need to make sure the units work out. Let me think about the units. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So when I divide ħ by Γ (which is in GeV), I get seconds.
