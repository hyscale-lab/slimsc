Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, brighter than 17, so the apparent magnitude should be less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitude means brighter. Like, the scale is inverted. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V ≤ 17 can be observed.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, their apparent magnitude must be ≤ 16. Because it's the same logic, brighter than 16 means magnitude is 16 or lower.

So the goal is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤ 17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). Wait, no, because both spectrographs can detect the star if the star's V is within their limits. So the star's V must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star must be bright enough for both. That means the apparent V mag must be ≤16, because 16 is the stricter condition.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be detectable by both instruments. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES). So the maximum it can be is 16, because if it's 17, HIRES can't see it. So the star's V must be ≤16.

Wait, but some stars might be more distant, so their apparent magnitude is higher. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star and then see which ones are ≤16.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 +5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs
