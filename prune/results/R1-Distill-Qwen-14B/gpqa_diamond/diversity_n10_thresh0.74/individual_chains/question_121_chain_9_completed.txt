Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because epoxide reactions can be a bit tricky. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. And the reagent is Me2CuLi, which I remember is a strong nucleophile, a cuprate reagent, typically used in conjugate additions or in opening epoxides.

First, I need to visualize the structure of the starting epoxide. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane ring system means it's a norbornane derivative. Norbornane is a bicyclic structure with two rings: a five-membered ring fused to a three-membered ring. The 7-oxa indicates that one of the bridge carbons is replaced by an oxygen, making it an epoxide.

Wait, so the numbering: the bridgehead carbons are 1 and 6, I think. Let me try to sketch this. So, the bicyclo structure: positions 1 and 6 are the bridgeheads. The substituents are at 1,3,4, and 6. The 6S is the oxygen, so the epoxide is between C6 and another carbon. Wait, no, the 7-oxa would be the oxygen in the bridge, so it's at position 7. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is similar to norbornene epoxide. Let's think: norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but the problem says bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, that's a different structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a five-membered ring and a two-membered ring? No, wait. The numbers in bicyclo represent the number of carbons in each bridge. So, bicyclo[m.n.p] where m ≥ n ≥ p. So, [4.1.0] means two bridges: one bridge of 4 carbons, another of 1, and another of 0? Wait, no, the three numbers add up to the total number of carbons in the rings, but in this case, it's heptane, which is seven carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, there are two bridges: the first bridge has 4 carbons, the second 1, and the third 0, but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a norbornane-like structure but with a different bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the epoxide is in a specific position. Let me try to draw it mentally.

The starting molecule is 1,3,4-trimethyl, so methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The oxygen is at C6 (since it's 7-oxa bicyclo...? Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the oxygen is at position 7. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structure of bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. From what I remember, the numbering of such bicyclic compounds can be a bit tricky. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a bridge between carbons 1 and 6 (assuming 7 carbons in total). So, the structure would have a five-membered ring and a two-membered ring? No, a two-membered bridge would be a single bond, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe it's a bridged bicyclic system where one bridge is longer.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine that the epoxide is part of a bicyclo structure where the oxygen is in a bridge. So, the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons, such as C1 and C6.

But perhaps I should focus on the reaction part. The problem states that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

Wait, so the reaction involves nucleophilic opening of the epoxide. Organocuprates (like Me2CuLi) are strong nucleophiles that can open epoxides. The mechanism is typically via an SN2-like attack, so the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon because that's more accessible.

In a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon (since the other is more hindered). Then, inversion occurs at that carbon.

But wait, in the case of bicyclic epoxides, the ring structure may influence the site of attack. The less hindered carbon would be the one where the nucleophile can approach more easily.

So, in the given epoxide, substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6. So, the structure has methyl groups at 1,3,4. The oxygen is at position 6 (since 6S is the configuration). Wait, the position of the oxygen is in the epoxide, so it's between two carbons. So, for bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the oxygen is perhaps at position 7.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure of the starting material.

The compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

So, the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has 7 carbons. The 7-oxa means the oxygen is at position 7. So, the structure is a bicyclic system where two rings share a common bridge, and the oxygen is part of one of the bridges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a seven-membered ring with two bridges, one of four carbons, one of one, and one of zero. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe I can proceed without the exact structure.

When the epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi, the methyl group (from the cuprate) will add to the less hindered carbon. Then, the ring opens, and the other oxygen will have the hydroxyl group (but wait, in epoxide opening with organocuprates, the product is an alcohol and the alkylated product).

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact product structure. Let me think again. Organocuprates add to epoxides via a conjugate addition in some cases, but in this scenario, it's a direct attack on the epoxide.

In the reaction, the cuprate (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide, leading to ring opening. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at that carbon.

Wait, in the epoxide, each oxygen is connected to two carbons. The more substituted carbon is more hindered, so the methyl group adds to the less substituted (less hindered) carbon.

So, let's say the epoxide has two carbons, A and B. If A is more substituted (more hindrance), then the nucleophile attacks B.

In the bicyclic system, perhaps the two epoxide carbons are bridgeheads or part of a bridge. The methyl group from the cuprate will add to the less hindered one.

After the attack, the ring opens, and the structure becomes a larger ring. The product will be a cyclohexanol derivative since the epoxide is part of a bicyclo system; opening it might lead to a six-membered ring.

Wait, norbornene epoxide upon ring-opening with, say, water would form a bicyclo structure, but in this case, the product is a cyclohexanol, as per the options.

So, let's think about the product structure. The options are all cyclohexanols with various substituents.

The problem is about the stereochemistry of the product.

So, when the methyl group adds to the less hindered carbon, inversion occurs at that carbon. Then, the other part of the epoxide (the other carbon) will have the hydroxyl group.

Wait, no. In the ring-opening, the nucleophile attacks one carbon (let's say C1), and the other oxygen becomes part of an alcohol group on the adjacent carbon (C2). So, the structure will have new substituents on C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents at various positions. The exact configuration depends on the starting material's stereochemistry and the attack site.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, the configuration at each of those carbons is R or S.

When the cuprate attacks, it adds a methyl group to the less hindered carbon (which I'll call C1), and the adjacent carbon (C2) will get the hydroxyl group.

But wait, how does the stereochemistry change during the attack? Since it's an SN2-like mechanism, the attack would happen from the opposite side, leading to inversion at C1.

Wait, the cuprate is a strong nucleophile. The attack is on the less hindered carbon, and the attack is from the side opposite to the leaving group (in an SN2 mechanism). So, if the epoxide's C1 has a certain configuration, the nucleophile will attack from the opposite side, causing inversion.

So, the configuration at C1 will invert when the methyl group attacks. But what about the configuration at C2?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this a bit wrong. Let me think again.

In a typical SN2 attack on an epoxide, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon. The leaving group (the oxygen) is connected to the adjacent carbon. When the nucleophile attacks, the oxygen (as part of the leaving group) becomes a hydroxyl group after the ring opens.

Wait, no. The epoxide oxygen is at the two carbons. When the methyl group attacks one carbon, the other oxygen becomes an -O- which is connected to the adjacent carbon. But wait, in epoxide ring-opening, both oxygens are part of the ring. So, when the nucleophile attacks one carbon, the oxygen bridges to the adjacent, leading to an alcohol on that adjacent carbon.

So, let's say the cuprate attacks carbon A (less hindered), then carbon B (adjacent) gets the hydroxyl group. But wait, the actual product would have the methyl group on A and the hydroxyl group on B.

But in the starting material, the configuration of each carbon is given. So, the attack will change the configuration of A (inversion) but what about B's configuration? Well, B is connected to the oxygen, which was part of the epoxide. So, perhaps B's configuration is determined by the stereochemistry during the attack.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclic structure leads to a specific transition state where the attack occurs from a certain face.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific structure of the starting epoxide. Since I'm a bit stuck on the structure, perhaps I can imagine the starting material as a norbornene-like epoxide but with substituents at 1,3,4.

Wait, but the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a bridge, and the epoxide oxygen is part of that bridge. So, perhaps the two carbons connected by the oxygen are the bridgeheads.

In that case, the epoxide is between two bridgeheads (like C1 and C6 in norbornane), making the epoxide ring strained and prone to attack.

When Me2CuLi reacts with this, the methyl group adds to the less hindered bridgehead.

But in a bicyclo structure, both bridgeheads are more or less equally hindered, depending on substituents.

Wait, the starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6. So, perhaps the bridgehead at C1 has a methyl, and C6 has the oxygen. The other bridge has substituents at C3 and C4.

So, when the methyl group from the cuprate attacks, it will add to the less hindered bridgehead. Let's say C6 is the one with the oxygen (epoxide), so the other bridgehead is C1. If C1 has a methyl, then perhaps the attack occurs at C6? No, because the methyl is already on C1.

Wait, maybe the attack is on the other bridgehead, which is not as substituted. Alternatively, perhaps the less substituted carbon is the one without the methyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs on the carbon that's less hindered, which is the one with fewer substituents.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the structure more carefully. The starting molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So, the substituents are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The oxygen is at C7, which is part of the bridge.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is a bicyclo where C7 is the oxygen, connected to C1 and C6. So, the epoxide is between C1 and C6.

Wait, that would make the epoxide part of the bridge. So, the structure is bicyclo with C1 and C6 as bridgeheads connected by an oxygen bridge. So, the bridge would be O-C1-C6-O? No, the epoxide is O connecting C1 and C6.

So, the bridge is O-C1-C6. Hence, the epoxide is between C1 and C6.

Now, the substituents are at C1 (methyl), C3 (methyl), C4 (methyl), and C6 (since the configuration is 6S, but that's the bridgehead with oxygen).

So, when the cuprate attacks, it will add to the less hindered bridgehead. Between C1 and C6, which is more substituted?

C1 has a methyl group and is connected to the epoxide. C6 is also a bridgehead, connected to the oxygen and perhaps other substituents.

Wait, maybe C1 has a methyl and is connected to the epoxide oxygen, making it more hindered, while the other bridgehead (C6) is less substituted, so the methyl group from the cuprate would add to C6.

Wait, but both are bridgeheads. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the less hindered carbon is the one where the methyl group is not present. Wait, but in this case, C1 has a methyl, so maybe C6 is less hindered because it's a bridgehead with the oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe the attack occurs on the less substituted epoxide carbon. Since C1 has a methyl, it's more substituted, so the methyl group would attack C6.

So, the methyl adds to C6, the other oxygen is connected to C1.

When the cuprate attacks, it attacks the less hindered carbon (C6), leading to inversion of configuration at C6.

Wait, but the starting configuration at C6 is S. Upon SN2 attack, the configuration inverts. So, after attack, C6 becomes R configuration.

But wait, in the starting material, C6 is S. After inversion, it becomes R.

Wait, but the product's configuration depends on where the methyl adds and the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, maybe the product's structure is a cyclohexanol with substituents at positions 1,2,4,5, etc.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol because the bicyclic epoxide, upon opening, forms a six-membered ring.

Let me think about the ring-opening. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide (O between C1 and C6) upon ring-opening would form a six-membered ring? Because when the epoxide opens, the two bridgehead carbons (C1 and C6) would become adjacent in the ring, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the ring-opening connects C1 and C6, which were previously connected by the oxygen. So, when the methyl adds to C6, and the oxygen opens into an alcohol on C1, the ring becomes a six-membered ring.

So, the new structure would have a cyclohexane ring with substituents at positions 1 (from C1, which was a bridgehead), 2 (from the adjacent bridge), and others.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with substituents at positions 2 and 5, etc., depending on where the methyl adds.

But perhaps I'm getting too stuck on the structure. Let me think about the options.

The options are all 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexanol derivatives, except option C which is 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, the starting material has three methyl groups: 1,3,4. After the reaction, a methyl group is added from the cuprate, making four methyl groups in the product.

So, the product must have four methyl groups.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D all have four methyl groups except perhaps I'm misreading. Wait, option A is 2,2,4,5; option B is 2,2,4,5; option C is 1,2,4,5; option D is 1,2,4,5. So all have four methyl groups.

So, where are the methyl groups coming from? The starting material has 1,3,4. The cuprate adds one more at the position where it attacks.

Wait, but the starting material already has methyl at 1,3,4. So in the product, where do the methyl groups end up?

If the methyl adds at C6, which in the product is a new position, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the numbering changes after the ring-opening. So, perhaps the original C1 becomes position 1 in the product, C3 and C4 are in the new ring, and the new methyl is added at position 2 or 5.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The key points are:

1. The methyl adds to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide (C6 in this case, maybe).

2. Inversion occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile adds.

3. The configuration of the other carbon (C1) would then determine the configuration of the hydroxyl group.

Wait, perhaps in the product, the configurations at the other positions (like C3 and C4) remain the same since the reaction doesn't affect those.

So, the starting material has R configurations at 1,3,4 and S at 6.

After the attack, C6 (where the methyl adds) inverts. So, if it was S, it becomes R.

But how does this translate into the product's configuration?

Wait, perhaps the product's configuration at the new positions (where the methyl and hydroxyl groups are added) depends on the attack's stereochemistry.

Another approach: in the product, the methyl group is at a certain position, and the hydroxyl is at another, with specific R/S configurations.

Looking at the options, they all have four methyl groups and the hydroxyl at position 1 or 2.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanol with the hydroxyl at position 1 or 2.

Wait, perhaps the attack occurs at C6, leading to the methyl group at that position, and the hydroxyl at C1.

So, the product would have the hydroxyl at C1 and methyl at C6, which, in the new cyclohexane ring, would correspond to specific positions.

Wait, this might not be the right approach. Let me think about the possible products.

Option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the hydroxyl is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2,2,4,5.

But how would that form from the starting material?

Another thought: the attack of the cuprate on the less hindered carbon (say, C6) would lead to the methyl group adding to C6. The adjacent carbon (C1) would get the hydroxyl group.

But the configuration at C6 would invert. So, if the starting C6 was S, the new configuration would be R.

But how does this translate to the product's configuration? Let's see.

In the product, the hydroxyl is at C1, and the methyl is at C6. But in the product's numbering, perhaps C1 is where the hydroxyl is, and the methyl is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product's structure has the hydroxyl at position 1 and methyl groups at 2,4,5, and 2 (since the starting material has methyl at 3 and 4, but after ring-opening, their positions change).

Alternatively, perhaps the starting substituents (3 and 4) become positions 2 and 5 in the product.

Wait, maybe the original substituents at positions 3 and 4 are now at positions 2 and 5 in the new ring. So, the starting methyl at 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 5, 1 remains 1, and the new methyl is at 6.

But in the new cyclohexane, numbering could be such that the hydroxyl is at 1, the new methyl is at 6, and the others are at 2,4,5.

But looking at the options, the hydroxyl is at 1 in options A and B, and at 1 in C and D as well.

Wait, option B is 1R,4R,5R. So, the methyl groups are 2,2,4,5. So, that would mean two methyl groups at 2, and one each at 4 and 5.

But the starting material has methyl at 1,3,4. So, after reaction, it's 1 (OH), 2 (methyl; from where?), 4 (methyl), 5 (methyl), and 6 (methyl from cuprate).

Hmm, perhaps the product has the methyl groups at 2,2,4,5. So, where do these come from?

The starting methyl at 3 would become something else. Maybe during the ring-opening, the substituents shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a new position for some substituents.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the inversion of configuration.

In the starting material, the configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks (C6) is S. After inversion, it becomes R.

So, the product would have R configuration at that carbon.

Looking at the options, which product has R configuration at the positions where the attack occurred.

Wait, if the methyl adds to C6 (which becomes a new position, say 2 in the product), then the configuration at that position would be R.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1S,4R,5S.

Option B: 1R,4R,5R.

Option C: 1R,2R,4R,5R.

Option D: 1R,2S,4R,5R.

So, the product would have R configuration at the position where the methyl was added.

Assuming the methyl is at position 2, then in option C, position 2 is R, which would fit. But option C has four substituents, so perhaps that's where the methyl is.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is at position 5.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Another approach: in a typical epoxide opening with a cuprate, the attack occurs at the less hindered carbon with inversion. So, the configuration at that carbon flips.

In the starting material, the configuration at C6 is S. After attack, it becomes R.

So, the product would have R at C6.

But the product options have different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration at the bridgehead (now part of the cyclohexane) determines the R/S.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's configuration is determined by the attack's stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration at C1 is R. After the attack, the configuration at C1 (which becomes the hydroxyl-bearing carbon) would also influence the product's configuration.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible products.

Looking at the options, the correct product would have the hydroxyl group and the new methyl group in specific configurations.

In the attack, the cuprate adds to the less hindered carbon (C6), leading to inversion. The other carbon (C1) gets the hydroxyl group.

So, the stereocenters in the product would be at positions where the substituents are added.

Perhaps the product has a hydroxyl at position 1, a methyl at position 2, and the others at 4 and 5.

Wait, but the options suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

So, the hydroxyl is at 1 (R), and methyl groups at 2,2,4,5. So, two methyl at 2, which would be from the starting material's C3 and C4.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting methyl at 3 and 4 become positions 2 and 5 due to the ring-opening.

Wait, when the epoxide ring opens, the substituents on the adjacent carbons might shift.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard. 

Another thought: the product becomes a cyclohexanol, and the configuration at the carbon where the methyl is added (the site of attack) would be R, whereas the starting material's configuration at that carbon was S. So, in the product, that carbon's configuration is R.

In the product, the hydroxyl is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 2 (if the attack was at C6, which becomes 2 in the product).

So, position 2 would be R, and position 1 would have the hydroxyl with R configuration.

Looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option B: 1R,4R,5R. So, position 1 is R, which aligns with the attack. But position 2 is not mentioned, but the substituents are 2,2,4,5. So, two methyls at 2, and one each at 4 and 5. So, that would require that the starting substituents at 3 and 4 become 2 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the ring-opening brings substituents from 3 and 4 into positions 2 and 5.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is at C6, leading to the product having substituents at 2,4,5, and the new methyl at 2.

But without a clear mental image, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is option B because the configuration would have R at position 1 (from the starting R at C1), R at 4 (from R in starting), and R at 5 (from inversion at C6, which was S becomes R). So, the product would have R at 1,4,5, and the methyl groups as per the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is option D, but I'm not certain.

Hmm. Another angle: in disubstituted epoxides, the nucleophile adds to the less hindered carbon with inversion. The product's configuration depends on that.

Given that the starting material's configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S), the methyl adds to C6 (S configuration) which inverts to R. The other carbon (C1) gets the hydroxyl group, and its configuration depends on the attack.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's C1 is R, and after the attack, the hydroxyl is added in a way that the configuration remains R.

So, the product would have R at C1 (hydroxyl), R at C4 (from the starting R), and the new methyl at C6 (now R). The substituents from C3 would end up at another position.

But I'm not certain about the exact positions.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.


The problem involves the reaction of (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with Me₂CuLi, a strong nucleophile that opens epoxides. The key points to consider are:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The molecule is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane derivative with an epoxide oxygen at position 7. The substituents are methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4, and the configuration is specified as (1R,3R,4R,6S). The epoxide is between carbons 1 and 6, with the less hindered carbon being the site of nucleophilic attack.

2. **Reaction Mechanism**: Organocuprates attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide in an SN2-like fashion, leading to inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. The nucleophile (methyl group from Me₂CuLi) adds to the less hindered carbon, while the other carbon of the epoxide becomes the alcohol-bearing carbon.

3. **Stereochemical Considerations**: 
   - The starting material has an S configuration at position 6. After the methyl group attacks this carbon, inversion occurs, changing the configuration to R.
   - The hydroxyl group is introduced at position 1, which retains its original R configuration.
   - The methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 remain unchanged, and their positions correspond to positions 2 and 5 in the product.

4. **Product Formation**: The reaction results in a cyclohexanol derivative with the hydroxyl group at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2, 2, 4, and 5. The stereochemistry at positions 1, 4, and 5 is R, R, and R, respectively.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol does not match the expected stereochemistry at position 1.
   - **Option B**: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol matches the expected stereochemistry and substituent positions.
   - **Option C**: (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol has incorrect substituent positions.
   - **Option D**: (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol does not match the expected stereochemistry at position 2.

Based on the analysis, the correct product is **(1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.

Answer: B
