Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target molecule. Let's see: it's a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so there's a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Then there's a substituent on the cyclohexane ring at position 1. That substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl would be a group where a cyclohexyl group is attached to a CH(OH) which is then connected to the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is: 

The main ring is cyclohexane. On carbon 1 of this ring, there's a branch that is CH(OH) connected to another cyclohexane (cyclohexyl group). And the main ring also has a -CHO group attached somewhere else, perhaps on carbon 1 as well? Or maybe on a different position? Hmm, the name suggests 1-(...), so the substituents are at position 1 of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is where the aldehyde is on the cyclohexane. So the main structure is cyclohexane with a -CHO group on carbon 1, and another substituent (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) also on carbon 1. So carbon 1 has two substituents: -CHO and -CH(OH)Cyclohexyl.

Wait, but that might not be possible. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons? Or perhaps the position is different. Alternatively, maybe the carbaldehyde is on the main ring, and the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but perhaps I can figure it out from the reaction steps.

The starting material is
