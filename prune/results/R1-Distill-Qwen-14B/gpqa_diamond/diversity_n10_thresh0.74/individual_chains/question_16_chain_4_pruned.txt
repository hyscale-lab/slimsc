Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, what's optical activity? Oh right, a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. This causes the compound to have stereoisomerism, leading to the ability to rotate plane-polarized light.

So the question is about how many of the given compounds are optically active. There are seven compounds listed, and I need to check each one to see if they have any chiral centers. Let me go through them one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Hmm. The structure here is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a substituent on each? So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Wait, but wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second.

Wait, but that's a problem. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure: the first carbon is Cl, double bond to the second, which has a methyl group (so CH(CH3)), and then the third and fourth carbons are CH2 and CH3.

Wait, but that's structure-wise. Now, the question is about stereoisomerism. So for the (Z) isomer, the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged such that the higher priority groups are on the same side.

But does this compound have any chiral centers? Let me think. The molecule has a double bond, so the carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are each bonded to two carbons and a Cl or a methyl group. Wait, C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2, which has a methyl (CH(CH3)), and then C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3.

Wait, so looking at C1: it's connected to Cl, two CH2 groups (since C1 is attached
