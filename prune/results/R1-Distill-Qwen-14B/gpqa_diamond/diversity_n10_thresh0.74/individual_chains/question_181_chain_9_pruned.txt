Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this solar neutrino problem. Hmm, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun, and neutrinos are produced during certain reactions in this process.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos, maybe. Because I remember that the dominant neutrinos from the Sun come from the pp chain, particularly the Beryllium-7 neutrinos, but those are from the CNO cycle? Or wait, no, the CNO cycle produces less, right?

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos via the process where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-3 nuclei, emitting a neutrino. That's the main source, I think. But the pp-III branch must be a specific part of the proton-proton chain that produces neutrinos. Oh, wait, no, I think the pp-III branch is when the two protons collide to form a diproton, which then decays into two separate helium-3 ions. Then, in the pp-I branch, the deuterium formed combines with another proton to make tritium, which then decays into helium-3 and a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrinos are produced
