Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? Oh yeah, they have a varying magnetic field, which allows them to accelerate particles to much higher energies than regular cyclotrons.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Oh, maybe it gets accelerated twice per revolution or something. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron.

I think the key here is to find out how much energy the proton gains each time it goes around the synchrocyclotron. Then, since the total energy is 950 MeV, we can divide that by the energy per revolution to find the number of revolutions.

Wait, I remember something about the energy gain per revolution in a cyclotron. For a cyclotron with a voltage V, the energy gained per half-cycle is eV, where e is the charge. But wait, in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field varies so that the time for each revolution increases as the proton's energy increases.

But in this problem, the voltage is time-dependent. The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). The frequency ν is probably the frequency of the electric field. Oh, but how does that relate to the proton's motion?

Wait, the acceleration in a cyclotron alternates direction each half-period of the electric field. So, each time the proton makes a half-revolution, it gets a kick from the electric field. So the energy gain per full revolution would be 2eU0, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's eU0 per half-revolution. Hmm, not entirely sure.

But let's think about the energy gained per revolution. A cyclotron's electric field alternates with frequency ν, and the protons are supposed to be accelerated each time the field is in the correct phase. So for each full cycle of the
