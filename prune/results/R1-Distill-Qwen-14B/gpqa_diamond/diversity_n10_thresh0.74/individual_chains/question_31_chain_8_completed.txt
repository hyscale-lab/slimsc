Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with toluene and ending up with a product whose molecular symmetry group we need to determine. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember those are related to point groups in molecular symmetry. So I'll need to track each step and see how the molecule changes.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I think that's nitration. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration usually adds a nitro group. Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would occur at the para position because the methyl group is an activating group and directs incoming substituents to para and ortho positions, but nitration is a strong nitrating agent and tends to go para more. Wait, but wait, the nitration of toluene typically gives nitrotoluene, which is either para or ortho, but I think the major product is para because it's more stable. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, I think this is a nitration followed by oxidation, but wait no, nitration is already done. Oh wait, maybe MnO2 is used for oxidation of the nitro group. The nitro group (NO2) in aromatic rings can be reduced or oxidized... Wait, in acidic conditions, nitro groups can be oxidized further? Or maybe it's a demethylation or something else. Wait, no, MnO2 in H2SO4 is probably for the oxidation of the nitro group. Let me think. Alternatively, another possibility: when nitrotoluene is treated with strong oxidizing agents, the methyl group might oxidize. Toluene's methyl is a benzyl position; oxidation of a benzyl group under strong conditions might convert it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, toluene has a methyl attached to benzene. Nitration gives para-nitrotoluene. Now, if we treat that with MnO2 and H2SO4, which is a strong oxidizing condition. I think the methyl group attached to the benzene ring (toluene) is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group. So the nitro group is in the para position, and the methyl becomes COOH. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid, or maybe benzene with a nitro group and a carboxylic acid group in the para positions. Wait, no, the structure would be benzene with a nitro group at position 4 (if the COOH is at position 1, then nitro would be at position 4). So the structure is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. That sounds like a Claisen condensation. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Claisen condensation is between esters, usually, but in this case, we have a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a saponification? No, because that's with esters and strong base. Wait, another reaction: maybe it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile or something else. Alternatively, the acetone and aqueous NaOH might be for a aldol condensation.

Wait, wait, product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid. So how does that react with acetone and NaOH? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced, but I don't think so. Wait, maybe the conditions are for a nucleophilic substitution or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a treatment that converts the nitro group into an amine. Oh wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if acetone and NaOH would do that. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring substitution.

Wait, another thought: maybe the nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where the nitro group is being hydrolyzed. Wait, nitro groups aren't typically hydrolyzed under basic conditions, but maybe in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second step. Let me re-examine. Product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. Then, treating with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh wait, maybe MnO2 is for the oxidation of the nitro group to a nitro acid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced. Wait, MnO2 is an oxidizing agent, not a reducing agent. So maybe in the presence of H2SO4, it's oxidizing the nitro group. Wait, but nitro groups are already strong deactivating groups; I'm not sure.

Wait another angle: Toluene (methylbenzene) → nitration gives nitrotoluene. Then, MnO2 and H2SO4. Maybe the methyl group is oxidized. The structure: benzene ring with nitro group and a methyl group. Wait, in the second step, if the methyl group is oxidized, it would become a COOH group. So the product would be 4-nitrobenzoic acid (since nitro is para to the COOH). So product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Then, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH. So, what's the reaction here? Acetone is (propan-2-one), so maybe the conditions are for a nucleophilic acyl substitution or something. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being converted into an amine under these conditions. Wait, I remember that nitrobenzoic acid can be reduced, but I'm not sure about the conditions given here.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetone and NaOH are for a substitution reaction. Wait, if the nitro group is a meta director, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is getting converted into its sodium salt. Because in aqueous NaOH, carboxylic acids would deprotonate to form carboxylate ions.

So, in product 2, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, the COOH group would become COO^- Na^+ in basic conditions. So we have sodium 4-nitrobenzoate.

Wait, but then what's the role of acetone? Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, perhaps the acetone is undergoing aldol addition. Hmm, but I'm not getting it. Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being hydrolyzed. Nitro groups can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. Nitrobenzoic acid may hydrolyze further, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being converted into an amine or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the conditions are for the reduction of the nitro group. But I don't think MnO2 would do that. Wait, in the second step, MnO2 is used as an oxidizing agent. Now, in the third step, maybe the nitro group is being reduced. But the reagents are acetone and aqueous NaOH. I don't think that's a standard reducing condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced. But nitro groups are strong EWG; not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think again. Product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Then, reaction with acetone and aqueous NaOH. Wait, acetone is a ketone. So in basic conditions, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl. But benzoic acid is converted to its sodium salt, which is a carboxylate. So perhaps the acetone is undergoing some kind of Claisen condensation, but with a carboxylate? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the conditions are for the DMSO oxidation or other oxidations, but no, acetone and NaOH... Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack on the nitro group? Unlikely, as nitro groups are not typically good at that.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being converted into an amine via some reaction. For example, using H2 and a catalyst would reduce nitro to amine, but here the reagents are different. Alternatively, maybe using NaBH4 or something, but NaOH and acetone don't suggest that.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible reactions of 4-nitrobenzoic acid with acetone and NaOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the ring is deactivated by the nitro group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, product 3 would have two COOH groups, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the acetone is acting as a nucleophile. Acetone can act as a nucleophile under certain conditions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced. But I don't recall a reaction where acetone and NaOH would substitute a nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the overall structure after each step.

Step 1: Toluene → para-nitrotoluene.

Step 2: para-nitrotoluene → oxidized to 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Step 3: 4-nitrobenzoic acid treated with acetone and NaOH.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the acetone is undergoing a condensation reaction with the carboxylic acid group. For example, perhaps forming a beta-keto acid or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are for a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by something else. For example, maybe acetone is acting as a nucleophile, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is being converted into an amine. Let's think about that. If the nitro group is reduced to an amine, the product 3 would be 4-aminobenzoic acid. But how would that happen with NaOH and acetone? Maybe some kind of substitution? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetone is acting as a solvent, and the NaOH is for saponification. Wait, but product 2 is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Maybe it's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetone is for a different reaction. Wait, maybe it's a protecting group reaction or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the molecular symmetry of the final product.

Wait, if product 3 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is a benzene ring with nitro and carboxylic acid groups para to each other. Then, the structure would have a plane of symmetry, perhaps the plane that bisects the ring between the nitro and COOH groups. So the point group would have certain symmetry elements.

Wait, but if after step 3, the structure changes, perhaps the nitro group is transformed into something else. So I need to figure out what product 3 is.

Another approach: Let's think of the nitration, oxidation, and then what the third step does. Let's say product 3 is 4-nitrobenzoate (the sodium salt) after deprotonation. So structure is a benzene ring with COO^- and NO2 groups para to each other.

The symmetry of this molecule: the benzene ring is symmetric. The substituents are para, so the molecule has a mirror plane that bisects the ring between the substituents.

So, the point group would be D2h or maybe another.

Wait, D2h is a high symmetry point group. Let's think about the possible symmetry operations.

The molecule has a mirror plane that bisects the ring, passing through the two substituents. It also has a center of inversion. Because the substituents are identical in type (both nitro and carboxylate are similar in being strong EWG), but in this case, they're different groups. Wait, nitro is NO2 and carboxylate is OOC^-.

Wait, nitro is a meta-directing group, and the carboxylate is also a strong EWG, but their positions are para. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, and perhaps a center of inversion.

Wait, the presence of a center of inversion would mean that the two substituents are mirror images through the center. But in this case, the nitro and carboxylate are para, so each is a mirror image of the other through the center. So yes, there is a center of inversion.

So the molecule would have a center of inversion (i), and at least one mirror plane (σ). Let me recall the point groups. Oh, D2h has a center of inversion, two perpendicular mirror planes, and a twofold axis perpendicular to the mirror planes. Alternatively, C2h would have a mirror plane and a twofold axis perpendicular to it, but without the center of inversion.

Wait, the molecule in question, with substituents at para positions, has a mirror plane that bisects the ring between the nitro and COO^- groups. It also has a center of inversion because each substituent is the mirror image through the center.

So, the point group would be D2h? Or is there another group?

Wait, for benzene derivatives, when two substituents are para, the point group is D2h. Because the molecule has multiple symmetry elements: a mirror plane, a center of inversion, and a twofold axis (maybe). For example, when there are two identical substituents in para positions, it's D2h.

But in this case, the substituents are different: one is nitro, the other is COO^-.

Wait, but nitro and COO^- are both deactivating groups and are strong electron-withdrawing. But their structures are different. So would the molecule still have D2h symmetry?

Hmm, symmetry elements don't depend on the substituents' nature, only on their positions and their own symmetry.

So for the benzene ring with two substituents in para positions, regardless of what they are, the molecule will have a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Imagine the benzene ring with substituents X and Y at positions 1 and 3 (if it's a meta arrangement), but in our case, they are at 1 and 4 (para). So the molecule would have a mirror plane that passes through the ring, bisecting the substituents. Also, it has a center of inversion, so each substituent is mapped to itself? Wait, no, because they are different groups. If the substituents are different, the center of inversion would not map the molecule onto itself.

Ah, right! Because if substituents are different (like nitro and COO^-), then the center of inversion would cause X to become Y and vice versa. But since X and Y are different, the molecule wouldn't map onto itself under inversion. So the center of inversion is not a symmetry element in this case.

So, the molecule would have only certain symmetry elements. Let me think again. If substituents are different and para, then the molecule has a mirror plane (the one that passes between the substituents), but no center of inversion because inverting X and Y would cause a different molecule.

What point group would that be?

The benzene ring with two different substituents in para positions would have Cs symmetry. Because there's only one mirror plane, and no other symmetry elements. Or wait, the Cs point group has a single mirror plane as its only symmetry element.

Wait, alternatively, the point group could be C2h. C2h has a mirror plane and a twofold axis perpendicular to it, but not a center of inversion. Wait, is that applicable here?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a twofold rotation axis perpendicular to the mirror plane. Let me think about benzene rings: a C2 axis would be perpendicular to the ring, through the center. If the substituents are para, then a 180-degree rotation would swap the substituents. But if the substituents are different, then this rotation wouldn't be a symmetry operation because X would become Y and Y would become X, which are different.

So, in that case, the only symmetry element is the mirror plane, making the point group Cs.

Wait, but what is the Cs point group? It's the group that has only a single mirror plane as its symmetry element. So in this case, product 3 would have a Cs symmetry.

So looking back at the options, option A is Cs.

Wait, but what if the substituents are such that another symmetry exists? Let me think again.

Another possibility: If the two substituents are identical, then D2h symmetry. But if substituents are different, then perhaps the only symmetry is the mirror plane. So in our case, since substituents are nitro and COO^- (different), the symmetry would be Cs.

So the answer would be option A) Cs.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with toluene and ending with a product whose molecular symmetry group needs to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (Toluene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄):** Toluene undergoes nitration, where the methyl group directs the nitro group to the para position due to its activating nature. The major product is **para-nitrotoluene**.

2. **Second Reaction (para-Nitrotoluene + MnO₂/H₂SO₄):** MnO₂ in acidic conditions is a strong oxidizing agent. The methyl group in para-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group, resulting in **4-nitrobenzoic acid** (benzoic acid with a nitro group in the para position).

3. **Third Reaction (4-Nitrobenzoic Acid + Acetone/Aqueous NaOH):** In the presence of aqueous NaOH, the carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to form the sodium salt of 4-nitrobenzoic acid, i.e., **sodium 4-nitrobenzoate**. Acetone does not directly react in this step but may act as a solvent or auxiliary reagent.

The final product, **sodium 4-nitrobenzoate**, has a benzene ring with a nitro group (NO₂) and a carboxylate group (COO⁻) in the para positions. The molecule has a **plane of symmetry** that bisects the benzene ring between the two substituents. However, since the nitro and carboxylate groups are different, there is no **center of inversion** or **twofold rotation axis**. Thus, the only symmetry element is the single mirror plane, corresponding to the **Cs point group**.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Cs:** Correct. The molecule has only one mirror plane as its symmetry element.
- **B) D₂h:** Incorrect. This point group requires multiple symmetry elements, including a center of inversion, which is absent here.
- **C) C₂h:** Incorrect. This point group also requires additional symmetry elements beyond a single mirror plane.
- **D) C₃:** Incorrect. This point group applies to molecules with threefold rotational symmetry, which is not relevant here.

The molecular symmetry group of the final product is **Cs**.
