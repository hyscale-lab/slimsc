Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest initially, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, so the nucleus is initially at rest. After fission, there are two fragments. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must also be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That makes sense.

First, let's get the masses figured out. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their masses is 3m. The problem says that 3m = 0.99 M. So M is the initial mass. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M each for m and 2m for the other. Wait, no: m is the lighter, so the other is 2m, so total mass is 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So the heavier fragment is 0.66 M. Got it.

But wait, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. But wait, the rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. So that's the initial rest energy. But after fission, the two fragments have rest masses, but their total rest mass is 0.99 of M. So the initial mass-energy is 300 GeV, and the rest mass energy after is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released in the process is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and any other forms, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so I think all the rest mass energy difference goes into their kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest energy of the two fragments is 3m c². Wait, no: the rest mass of each fragment is m and 2m, so their rest energies are m c² and 2m c². So the total rest energy is 3m c². Since m = 0.33 M, then 3m = M, so 3m c² = M c². But wait, the initial rest energy is M c² = 300 GeV. So 3m c² = (3m) c² = M c²? Because 3m is 0.99 M, so 3m c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the rest mass energy after is 297 GeV, and the initial was 300 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV. But this released energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments. Because in the initial state, all was rest energy, and after, we have rest energy plus kinetic energy.

So the total kinetic energy (K) of the two fragments is 3 GeV. But wait, let me make sure. The initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV. The final energy is (m c² + 2m c²) + K1 + K2. Wait, m + 2m =3m, which is 0.99 M, so 3m c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So total energy after is 297 + K1 + K2 = 300 GeV → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. Now, the problem is about T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. We need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation.

So first, let's think about the classical approximation. In the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.

In the classical case, the momentum of each fragment must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction because initial momentum is zero. So p1 = -p2.

Momentum p = m v, but since the masses are m and 2m, let me denote v1 as velocity of the lighter fragment, v2 as velocity of the heavier.

So m v1 = 2m v2 → v1 = 2 v2.

Then, the kinetic energy (non-relativistic) is (1/2) m v1² + (1/2)(2m) v2². But since v1=2 v2, substitute:

(1/2) m (4 v2²) + (1/2)(2m)(v2²) = 2 m v2² + m v2² = 3 m v2².

But what's the total? The sum of KE is 3 GeV, which is 3,000 MeV. But wait, wait, 3 GeV is 3,000 MeV. Wait, no: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, 1 MeV is 1e6
