Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the problem involves salts A and B being heated. They're equimolar, and their total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes, and each tube reacts with the gases in a specific way.

The first tube has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that magnesium perchlorate is a strong desiccant and can react with water. So, any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. The weight of this tube increases by 3.60 grams. That suggests that the amount of water vapor is 3.60 grams because Mg(ClO4)2 would gain that much water.

Next, the gases go through a Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of this tube didn't change. Wait, Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. If the weight didn't change, that implies there was no CO2 in the gases. Because if there was CO2, the solution would have reacted, and the weight would increase (as CaCO3 precipitate forms). So, no CO2 is present.

Then, the gases pass through red-hot copper. The tube's weight increases by 0.80 grams, which is likely due to the formation of CuO. Red-hot copper reacts with water (since at high temperatures, water can decompose into H2 and O2, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is with H2O vapor?) Wait, wait. When H2O is passed over hot copper, does it react? Oh right, under certain conditions, like with a catalyst, H2O can decompose, but maybe in this case, it's about the reaction with O2. Wait, but the copper is hot. Let me think. Oh, right! Copper at high temperatures can react with water vapor. The reaction is 2 Cu + H2O → CuO + H2. So, the copper gains oxygen, which would increase its weight. So the 0.80 g increase is the mass of O from the water. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of the product CuO. Hmm, wait. Let me clarify.

The reaction would be 2 Cu(s) + H2O(g) → CuO(s) + H2(g). So, for every 2 moles of Cu, 1 mole of H2O is consumed, producing 1 mole of CuO and 1 mole of H2. The mass increase in the copper tube would be the mass of the CuO formed minus the mass of the Cu consumed. Let me calculate that.

Let's denote the moles of H2O as n.

The reaction: 2 Cu → 2 CuO (but that's not balanced; let me correct it). No, the correct reaction is 2 Cu + H2O → CuO + H2. So for each mole of H2O, 2 moles of Cu react to form 1 mole of CuO and 1 mole of
