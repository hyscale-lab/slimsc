Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor here is around 20, which is pretty high. So, these particles are moving really fast, close to the speed of light.

The problem states that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. But now, they want to find the Lorentz factor needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Hmm, okay. So initially, when the Lorentz factor is ~20, one third reach the walls. We need to change the Lorentz factor so that two-thirds do. I'm guessing this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying.

Wait, right, in particle physics, the lifetime of a particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector walls depends on its speed. So the faster it goes (higher Lorentz factor), the longer it lives, allowing it to travel further.

But wait, the distance to the wall is fixed. So if the particles have a longer lifetime, they can travel a longer distance. But in the initial case, only a third make it. So perhaps the proper lifetime is such that only those particles which move faster can reach the detector walls within their lifetime.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me think about the time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall.

The detector has a radius R = 30 meters. The particle is created at the center, so it needs to travel a distance R to reach the wall.

The time it takes in the lab frame is t = R / v, where v is the particle's velocity.

But in the particle's frame, its lifetime is tau, and due to time dilation, the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying is v * gamma * tau.

Wait, maybe that's the proper way to think. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab measures gamma tau. The distance is v multiplied by that time.

So,
