Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

So, the problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, I think I should analyze the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know what X is, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me look at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak in the 3400–2500 region suggests an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is common in esters, ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be in that region. But sometimes, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1740-1720, which fits the 1720 here. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but without more info, I can't be sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty downfield shift. Broad singlet. Aromatic protons are usually around 7-8 ppm, so maybe this is an aldehyde proton? But wait, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid, but they're usually exchanged and might not show up as a peak or could be a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would be broad, but maybe that's what this peak is. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde. I'm a bit confused here.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two sets of doublets,
