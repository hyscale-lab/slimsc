Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. They've given some ratios, and I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. 

Wait, the planets are studied using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between each pair of planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So the overall ratio from Planet1 to Planet3 would be 1.4 * 2.3, which is... let's see, 1.4 times 2 is 2.8, 1.4 times 0.3 is 0.42, so total 3.22. So their equilibrium temperatures are T1, T2 = 1.4 T1, T3 = 2.3 T2 = 3.22 T1.

But equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ d^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, d is distance from star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all albedos are 0.3 and assuming the star's luminosity is the same for all planets (because they orbit the same star), the ratio of temperatures should depend only on the inverse square root of their distances.

So, T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4). So T1 / T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/4). Wait, no wait. Let me get that right. Let me think, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4). So if I have T1 and T2 as the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, then T1 / T2 = [ (d2² (1 - a)) / (d1² (1 - a)) ) ]^(-1/4) because when you take the ratio, the (1 - a) and σ and π terms cancel out. Wait, maybe better to write it as T proportional to (1/d)^(1/4). So T1 = k * (d1)^(-1/4), T2 = k * (d2)^(-1/4). So T1 / T2 = (d2/d1)^(1/4). Because T1 is proportional to d1^(-1/4), so T1 = T0 / d1^(1/4), same for T2. So T1 / T2 = (d2 / d1)^(1/4). 

Wait, let me make sure. If d increases, the planet is farther away, so equilibrium temperature decreases. So if Planet2 is farther than Planet1, T2 will be smaller than T1. But in
