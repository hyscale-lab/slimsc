Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about gamma-ray photons annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. I need to find the energy of the gamma-rays that have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are A to D, with various energies in GeV.

Wait, I think this has to do with the photon-photon interaction. High-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons. The cross-section for this interaction probably depends on the energy of the gamma-rays and the CMB photons. When the gamma-ray's energy is high enough, this interaction becomes significant, limiting how far the gamma-ray can travel, hence limiting its lifetime in the universe.

I've heard that this process is a way gamma-rays lose energy or get absorbed over cosmological distances. So, for very high-energy gamma-rays, their lifetime is determined by the time it takes until they annihilate with a CMB photon. The time it takes depends on the probability of this interaction, which depends on the cross-section and the density of the CMB photons they're interacting with.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs should be considered. I think the cross-section σ is proportional to some function of the energies of the two photons. Wait, but in the lab frame, one photon is the CMB photon, and the other is the gamma-ray. But since the CMB is isotropic and the number is so high, we can perhaps treat it as a bath of low-energy photons.

The probability of interaction would involve the cross-section multiplied by the number density of the target photons (the CMB photons) and the path length. So the mean free time τ is inversely proportional to (σ * n_CMB * v), where v is the relative velocity. But wait, for photons, the velocity is the speed of light, so perhaps it's accounted for in the cross-section. Alternatively, the optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the number density, and the path length (which for cosmological purposes is roughly the age of the universe times the speed of light).

Wait, the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the optical depth becomes significant. The optical depth τ is given by τ = n_target * σ * L, where L is the length of the path. If τ becomes large, the probability of interaction is high, so the gamma-rays can't travel far. So the condition for the lifetime being limited is when the mean free time τ is comparable to the age of the universe, I think.

The age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, so let's convert that into seconds. Let me calculate that. One year is about 3.15e7 seconds, so 13.8e9 years is 13.8e9 * 3.15e7 ≈ approx 4.35e17 seconds.

So the mean free time τ is the age of the universe. τ ≈ 4e17 seconds.

Then, τ is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is n_target * σ * v. But since photons are moving at speed c, perhaps the cross-section already includes the relative velocity, or maybe it's taken care of in the calculation.

So, τ = 1/Γ = 1/(n_target * σ * c), perhaps? Or maybe Γ = n_target * σ * c, since the photon travels a distance c*τ in time τ, so the number of targets encountered is n_target * c * τ.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Let me think again. The formula for the mean free path λ is λ = 1/(n_target * σ), because the mean free path is the average distance a photon travels between interactions. So the time it takes to travel that distance is λ / c. So τ = λ / c = 1/(n_target * σ * c).

But wait, in this case, the gamma-ray is moving through a medium with CMB photons. So the number of CMB photons per unit volume is n_CMB. So the mean free time for the gamma-ray to annihilate would be τ = 1/(n_CMB * σ * c).

Wait, but when you have two particles moving towards each other, the cross-section is multiplied by the sum of their velocities or something? No, I think for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section is given in terms of the center-of-mass (CM) energy, and the calculations are a bit more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section σ is a function of the gamma-ray energy and the CMB photon energy. Let's denote the gamma-ray energy as E, and the CMB photon energy as ε (given as 1e-3 eV). 

The threshold energy for producing an electron-positron pair is when the total center-of-mass energy is at least 2*m_e*c², where m_e is the electron mass. Wait, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So the threshold condition for the process γ + γ → e+ + e- is when the combined energy in the CM frame is at least 2*m_e c².

That gives a relation between E and ε. Let's think about the invariant s, which is the square of the total 4-momentum. For two photons, s = (E + ε)^2 - (p_E + p_ε)^2 c^2. But since photons are massless, E = |p| c. Also, direction matters. Assuming the gamma-ray and the CMB photon are moving in opposite directions (so that their momenta are opposite), the invariant s becomes (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2 c^2 / c^2? Wait, maybe I should calculate it more carefully.

The four-momentum of the gamma-ray is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z), and for the CMB photon, assuming it's moving in the opposite direction, it's (ε/c, -p'_x, -p'_y, -p'_z). Since the photons can be moving in any direction, but the average is isotropic, but perhaps the problem is considering the case where they are head-on, so for the maximum possible s.

Wait, in the case where the two photons are moving in opposite directions, the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E/c - ε/c) in magnitude. So the invariant s is (E + ε)^2 - ( (E - ε)/c )^2 c^2. Let me compute that.
