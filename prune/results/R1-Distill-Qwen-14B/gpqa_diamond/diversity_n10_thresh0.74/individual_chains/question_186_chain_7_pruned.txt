Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I need to find out what product it forms after undergoing a Cope rearrangement.

Wait, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically happens in 1,5-dienes, right? The rearrangement forms a new six-membered ring, usually bicyclic structures. But wait, in this case, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So maybe it's part of a bridged system.

Let me visualize the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has two rings, a seven-membered ring fused with another. The 2-azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen in position 2. And there's a vinyl group attached at the same position.

So the structure is a norbornene derivative with a nitrogen and a vinyl substituent at the same carbon. When the Cope rearrangement occurs, the diene (the conjugated double bonds) should rearrange. Wait, does the starting molecule have two double bonds? Let me think: 2-vinyl means there's a double bond between C2 and C3 (since vinyl is CH2=CH-). And
