Okay, so I have this problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. Alright, so the scenario is that there's an alien spacecraft traveling at a high speed towards Earth, and I need to calculate how long the astronaut will experience the trip taking. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know if they'll live long enough to reach Earth.

Wait, the given speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to the speed of light. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to c, special relativity effects like time dilation become significant. Time dilation is when time moves slower for the moving object relative to a stationary observer.

So the key here is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of referenceâ€”in this case, the astronaut's ship.

The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, that's from the perspective of someone outside, like an observer on Earth. Wait, no, wait. Because the astronaut is on the ship, the Earth is moving away from them. But for the astronaut, the trip's duration is the proper time, which is shorter than the Earth's frame time.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Earth's frame. So from Earth's perspective, how long does it take for the spacecraft to reach them? Because the distance is the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the distance. Oh
