Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait—that's a vector, right? So the state vector is a 3x1 column matrix. The elements are -1, 2, and 1. Since it's a quantum state, it should be normalized. Oh wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Oh right, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1 if it's a normalized state.

Let me calculate that: (-1)^2 is 1, 2 squared is 4, and 1 squared is 1. So 1 + 4 + 1 is 6. Wait, that's 6, not 1. So this vector isn't normalized. Hmm, that might complicate things because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Maybe I should normalize it before proceeding.

But wait, the question is about the observable P. Oh, I should probably proceed without worrying about normalization for now and see if the problem requires it. Let me see what the observable P looks like.

The observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, let me write that out properly.

So P is:

[ 0          1/√2        0      ]
[1/√2       0           1/√2  ]
[ 0          1/√2        0      ]

Wait, actually, is that correct? Because each row has three elements. So first row is [0, 1/√2, 0], second is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], third is [0, 1/√2, 0]. 

But wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the observable (operator) is Hermitian, so the matrix should be Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, each element P_ij should equal the conjugate of P_ji. Since all the elements here are real, this reduces to P_ij = P_ji. Let's see:

P_12 is 1/√2, and P_21 is 1/√2. That's equal. P_13 is 0, and P_31 is 0. P_23 is 1/√2, and P_32 is 1/√2. So yes, the matrix is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So that's good.

The question is asking for the probability that the measurement of observable P yields 0. So I need to find the probability that when I measure P, the outcome is 0.

In quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable correspond to the eigenvalues of the operator. So to find the possible results, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but sometimes the observable can have an eigenvalue 0, and I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue. The probability is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenspace.

So first step: find the eigenvalues of P. Let's do that. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I would be:

[ -λ        1/√2      0    ]
[1/√2    -λ       1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2    -λ    ]

Wait, no. Wait, P is 3x3. Let me construct P - λ I correctly.

P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So subtracting λ from the diagonal elements:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ]

Now, the determinant of this matrix is zero. Let's compute the determinant.

Hmm, this might get a bit involved. Let me write it out.

The determinant is:

| -λ      1/√2      0      |
|1/√2    -λ       1/√2 |  
| 0       1/√2    -λ     |

To compute this determinant, I can expand along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify things.

The determinant = -λ * det(minor of (-λ)) - (1/√2) * det(minor of (1/√2)) + 0 * det(...)

Wait, the minors for the first row:

First element (-λ) is at (1,1). The minor is the 2x2 matrix:

[ -λ     1/√2 ]
[1/√2   -λ ]

Wait, no. Wait, the minor matrix when you remove row 1 and column 1 is:

Row 2: [ -λ, 1/√2 ]
Row 3: [1/√2, -λ ]

Wait, no. Let me think. The minor for element (1,1) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix that remains after removing row 1 and column 1.

In the original 3x3 matrix, after removing row 1 and column 1, the minor is:

Row 2: [-λ, 1/√2]
Row 3: [1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant of this minor is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) = λ² - (1/2).

Then, the first term is (-λ) multiplied by this determinant, but with a sign based on (-1)^(1+1) = 1. So term1 = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2).

The second element in the first row is 1/√2, located at (1,2). The minor is the matrix after removing row 1 and column 2:

Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ ]

Wait, no. Let me recheck. When you remove row 1 and column 2, the remaining elements are:

Row 2: [1/√2 (position (2,1)), 1/√2 (position (2,3))]
Row 3: [0 (position (3,1)), -λ (position (3,3)) ]

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original matrix after removing row 1 and column 2 would be:

Columns are 1 and 3, rows are 2 and 3.

So for row 2, the remaining elements at columns 1 and 3 are [1/√2, 1/√2].

For row 3, the remaining elements are [0, -λ].

Wait, no, row 3 is [0,1/√2, -λ], so after removing column 2, it's [0, -λ].

So the minor is:

[1/√2, 1/√2
 0,     -λ ]

So the determinant of this minor is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = -λ/(√2).

But wait, wait, the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [1/√2 (from original row 2, column 1), 1/√2 (from original row 2, column 3)]
Row 3: [0 (from original row 3, column 1), -λ (from original row 3, column 3)]

So the minor is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[0,     -λ ]

Determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) )= -λ/√2.

But wait, the sign for the second term is (-1)^(1+2) = (-1)^3 = -1. So the second term is (1/√2) * (-1) * [determinant of minor], which is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2)(λ /√2) = λ/(2).

The third term in the expansion is zero, so we can ignore it.

Putting it all together, the determinant is:

term1 + term2 = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2).

So let's compute this:

= (-λ^3 + (λ/2)) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ(-λ^2 +1 ) = 0.

Which gives λ=0, or -λ^2+1=0 → λ^2=1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So the possible outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0, and then find the projection of the given state onto that eigenspace.

Wait, but how many eigenvectors are there for λ=0? Let me find the eigenspace for λ=0.

So for λ=0, solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix P is:

[0  1/√2  0 ]
[1/√2 0 1/√2]
[0 1/√2 0 ]

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) )= 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → again v2=0, which is already known.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → so v1 can be any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector (1, 0, -1).

So any vector in the eigenspace for λ=0 can be written as (a, 0, -a), where a is a scalar.

Wait, so the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So the eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity one. Therefore, the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Let me check if this is correct.

Let me plug it into P. Let v = (1, 0, -1).

P v would be:

First component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So P v = (0,0,0), which is 0 * v. So this eigenvector works.

So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1) up to scaling. Let me normalize this vector to make it a unit vector. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but the state vector given in the problem is (-1, 2, 1). Wait, earlier I thought it wasn't normalized. Let me calculate its norm.

Norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So to normalize, we'd divide by sqrt(6). So the normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

But wait, the problem says that the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps we should proceed without normalizing, because in quantum mechanics, the probabilities depend on the square of the amplitude, but if the state is not normalized, the probabilities would be (inner product)^2 divided by the norm squared of the state. Hmm, since the problem doesn't mention normalization, maybe it's expected to proceed without it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is given, and I need to compute the probability regardless of normalization. Wait, no, because without normalization, the probabilities would sum to more than 1. So perhaps I should normalize the state first.

So let's compute the normalized state. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt(6), so normalized state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the projection of this state onto the eigenspace of P for eigenvalue 0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, the projection is just the inner product of the state with the normalized eigenvector.

The eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). Let me denote this as |e>.

The state |ψ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

The inner product <e|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

So sum of both terms: -1/(sqrt(12)) -1/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/sqrt(12).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12) = 2√3. So (-2)/(2√3) )= -1/√3.

So the inner product is -1/√3.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product. So ( |-1/√3| )^2 = (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we first analyze the given state vector and the observable matrix. The state vector is given as \((-1, 2, 1)\), but it is not normalized. Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right).
\]

The observable \(P\) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \(P = 0\), we determine the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue \(0\). Solving \((P - 0I)v = 0\), we find that the eigenvectors for \(P = 0\) satisfy \(v_2 = 0\) and \(v_3 = -v_1\). Thus, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by the vector \((1, 0, -1)\). Normalizing this vector gives:

\[
|e\rangle = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\]

The probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is the square of the absolute value of the projection of \(|\psi\rangle\) onto \(|e\rangle\). The projection is calculated as:

\[
\langle e | \psi \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}\right) + 0\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\right) + \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle e | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle e | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left|\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \(P = 0\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
