Okay, so I've got a question about molecular biology here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about a scientist who's trying to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G gene. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct, and I'm supposed to figure out why it's not working.

The options are A to D, each suggesting a different reason. Let's break down what each part means.

First, the construct: They introduced a HA tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are usually added to proteins for detection and purification. So, the coding sequence (CDS) of GADD45G should have the HA tag before the start codon. Wait, no, wait. No, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So that would mean it's inserted before the start codon (ATG) of the GADD45G gene, right? Because the N-terminus is the beginning of the protein.

Looking at the plus strand sequence provided. Let me see. The sequence starts with 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACT... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. So, wait a minute. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, shouldn't it come before the ATG? Because the N-terminus is the start of the protein. Oh, but wait, in the DNA sequence, the coding sequence is written as the mRNA would be, right? So the plus strand is the same as mRNA.

Wait, let's clarify. The HA tag is inserted into the coding sequence such that the protein starts with HA, followed by GADD45G. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence, then the start codon (ATG) for GADD45G.

But looking at the given sequence, the first part is ATG, then TAC, etc. So that's the beginning of the GADD45G coding region, right? So that suggests that the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted. Or perhaps it's in the wrong place.

Wait, the problem arises because the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence first, then the start codon for GADD45G. But the given sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine. That would mean that the HA isn't present. So why is that?

Hmm, the question says they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So perhaps the HA sequence wasn
