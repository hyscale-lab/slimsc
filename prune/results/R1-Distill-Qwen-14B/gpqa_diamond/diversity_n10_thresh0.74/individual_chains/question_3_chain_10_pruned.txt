Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_z, right? So sigma_z is the Pauli z-matrix, which I remember has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the given state.

Hmm, okay, expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the conjugate of the state vector, applying the operator, and then multiplying by the state vector. Since the state is already given in terms of the eigenstates of σz, maybe that will help.

Wait, but σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are different, I think they're superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly write the state in terms of σx eigenstates unless I find the components. Maybe I don't need to though, because I can compute the expectation value using the components as they are.

Let me think about how to approach this. The operator is a sum of two terms, so I can split the expectation value into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, so E[A+B] = E[A] + E[B].

So I can compute the expectation of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy.

The expectation value of σz is given by:

⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1)

Wait, because when you measure σz on |↑⟩, you get +1, and on |↓⟩ you get -1. So the expectation is the probability of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Calculating the probabilities: |0.5|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So the first term is 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. The second term is 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Wait, but wait. I can also compute this using the explicit matrix form. σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the state |ψ⟩ is [0
