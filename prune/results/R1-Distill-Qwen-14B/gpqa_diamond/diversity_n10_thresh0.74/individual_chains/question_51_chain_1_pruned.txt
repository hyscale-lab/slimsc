Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see... The question is about finding the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I've studied some electrostatics before, but I'm a bit rusty on some concepts. Let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the setup is this: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere. The sphere has a radius R and is grounded. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are all different expressions involving k, q squared, d, and R. So I should probably think about the potential energy in the context of charges and conductors.

First, I remember that a grounded conductor means that the conductor is connected to the Earth, which implies that any excess charge on it can go to the Earth. But wait, in this case, the sphere is neutral to start with, right? Because the problem doesn't say anything about it initially having a charge. So when you bring a charge q near it, what happens?

I think when you bring a charge near a conductor, the charges on the conductor redistribute. If the conductor was neutral, the presence of the external charge would induce charges of opposite sign on the near side and same sign on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can leave the sphere, but wait, actually, no. Wait, hold on. Grounding allows charges to flow in or out. So when a positive charge is brought near the sphere, electrons will be attracted to the near side. But since the sphere is grounded, these electrons can leave the sphere. Oh wait, no, wait. If the charge is positive, it would attract electrons from the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow into the ground, so the sphere would end up with a positive charge? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, when you bring a positive charge near a grounded conductor, the conductor's electrons are attracted to the near side. Since the conductor is connected to ground, electrons can leave the conductor, so the conductor loses electrons. That would leave the conductor with a positive charge. So the sphere would have a positive charge induced, but because it's grounded, that positive charge can't stay on the sphere. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If the sphere is grounded, when you bring a positive charge near, the sphere's electrons (negative charges) are attracted towards the near side. Because the conductor was originally neutral, the electrons can move. But since it's grounded, the electrons can leave the conductor into the ground. So the sphere would lose electrons, effectively gaining a positive charge. But wait, the sphere was initially neutral. Hmm, perhaps I need to think again about the induction process.

So, when you bring a charge q near the sphere, the sphere's free electrons (if any) would be attracted to the near side. But if the sphere is neutral, it has no net charge, but when the external charge is placed nearby, it induces a charge distribution. Because the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can leave or enter the sphere through the ground. So in the case of a positive charge q, the induced charge on the sphere would be negative near the charge and positive on the far side. But because the sphere is connected to ground, the extra electrons can leave the sphere, so the near side can't have a negative charge. Wait, maybe the
