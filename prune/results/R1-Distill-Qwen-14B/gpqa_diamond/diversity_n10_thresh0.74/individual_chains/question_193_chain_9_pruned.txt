Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

The options are A through D: A is ~r^3, B is ~r^5, C is ~r^4, D is ~r^2.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from two different points in the Earth's orbit. The formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1 / parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So plx = 1/distance (d), where distance is in parsecs.

Wait, so plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So if I substitute d into this, because plx is 1/d, then plx^5 would be (1/d)^5. So 1/plx^5 is 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is d^5. So that would make the number of stars proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance r, per unit range. So if the number N is proportional to d^5, then how does N change as we move a small distance dr? That's like taking the derivative of N with respect to d.

So dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So r is the distance here. So if the number of stars in a region increases as d^5, then the rate of change (the number per unit distance) would be proportional to d^4.

But wait, let me think again. The number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, N proportional to d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. Let's say we have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would be the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by
