Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

The question provides data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The main peaks are at 3000 cm-1 (very broad), 1700, and 1650. So, what functional groups do these correspond to?

The broad peak around 3000 is probably an -OH stretch, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, could it be a carbonyl oxygen with something else? Or perhaps an O-H from a hydroxyl group. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding. So that might suggest an -OH group, like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which fits the 3000 region. So that's a possibility.

Then the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Let's think about what those are. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is common in aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, etc. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl group, maybe conjugated or maybe something else. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch or maybe an amide. But considering the other data, let's think more.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an O-H bending in a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Let me think. If the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, then the carbonyl could be at around 1700 and the conjugated C=C at 1650. That makes sense. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the presence of a double bond, probably in the structure. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond, perhaps conjugated.

Then the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a CH3O group? Or maybe a (CH2O) group, but more likely, it's something like a CH3CO (43, but wait, 43 is more like acetone or CH3CO-). Wait, let me calculate:
