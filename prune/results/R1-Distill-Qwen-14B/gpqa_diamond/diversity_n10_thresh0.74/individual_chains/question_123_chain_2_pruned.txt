Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta and how far it travels from the galaxy's perspective. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved—Newtonian mechanics should apply here, I think.

Wait, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, because in relativity, if frame A sees frame B moving at velocity v, then frame B sees A moving at velocity -v, assuming it's non-accelerating. But wait, wait—is this a case for special relativity or can we use classical mechanics since the speeds are high but maybe not relativistic enough? Let me check the numbers. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 20% of c. That's significant; perhaps we need to consider relativistic effects. But wait, the question says to ignore gravity, so maybe that's the only factor.

Wait, the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is different in each frame. Oh right, time dilation. So maybe I can't just use the simple distance = velocity * time because the time experienced in each frame is different.

Let me think about it. So, the problem is about relative velocity and time between frames. Because both are inertial, we can use the Lorentz transformation to relate the times and distances.

Let me outline what I know:

- In the ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v = 60,000 km/s. So, the velocity of the Galaxy frame (S) relative to S' is -60,000 km/s. Wait, no—if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center in the Galaxy's frame (S), then from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is approaching at that velocity. So, the relative velocity between S and S' is 6e4 km/s, but direction matters.

Wait, perhaps the velocity of S (
