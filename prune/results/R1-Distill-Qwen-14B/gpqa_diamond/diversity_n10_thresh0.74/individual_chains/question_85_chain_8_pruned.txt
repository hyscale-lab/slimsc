Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out.

The question gives me data on two planets detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius is 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature is 6300 K. Each planet has its own mass and radius, but the key thing here is their orbital periods or maybe their distances since they're in circular orbits.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is 1. The albedo is same, so that term is same for both, so it cancels out in the ratio.

So the main factors will be the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's distance from the star (a).

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the planets' orbital distances directly. It gives me data from the transit and radial velocity methods. I think the radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Oh, wait, in RV measurements, the Doppler shift gives the velocity of the star, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But in this problem, the RV shifts are given in terms of Ångströms—like shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å.

Hmm. Oh wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is the star's velocity towards or away from us. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula I think is:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/
