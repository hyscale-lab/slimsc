Okay, so I've got this question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17 in V. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, any star that is brighter than 17 mag (so, magnitude less than 17) can be seen by ESPRESSO, and for HIRES, it's magnitude less than 16. So a star that's bright enough for both would need to be less than 16 mag, because if it's brighter than 17, it's definitely brighter than 16. Wait, no. Wait, the ESPRESSO limit is brighter than 17, meaning they can observe up to 17 mag, but not beyond. So star must be apparent magnitude <= 17 for ESPRESSO, and <=16 for HIRES. So a star that is, say, 16 mag would be visible to both. Or, an apparent magnitude of 15 would be okay for both. But a star that's 17 would be too faint for HIRES.

So each star's apparent magnitude is the main thing to look at. Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitude given, others have apparent, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent magnitude. Oh right, because interstellar extinction (dust) makes stars appear dimmer and redder. The formula to calculate the extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So apparent magnitude needs to be corrected for extinction.

Wait, but wait: so the observed apparent magnitude (what we measure) is actually the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction. So m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

But wait, no, the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear fainter, so the magnitude increases.

Wait, magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Lower magnitude is brighter, higher is dimmer. So if a star's light is absorbed, more extinction, higher apparent magnitude.

So for each star, I need to compute the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then see if it's <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES.

Wait, but the question states that for each spectrograph, the brightness limit is apparent V magnitude. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, it can be observed. Similarly for HIRES, brighter than 16.

So for each star, I need to compute their apparent V magnitude, considering any interstellar extinction given.

Let me go through each star.

Star1: RA=15, DEC=-75. Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Absolute magnitude M is given. Apparent magnitude m can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

So d=10 pc, log10(10)=1, so m = 15.5 +5*1 -5 = 15.5 +5-5=15.5.

Check if there's any extinction. The star's parameters don't mention E(B-V) or any extinction, so assume E(B-V)=0. So m_observed =15.5.

So Star1's m is 15.5. Now, is this within the limits of both spectrographs?

ESPRESSO: m <=17. 15.5 is okay. HIRES: m <=16. 15.5 is <=16. So Star1 can be observed by both? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, brighter than 17
