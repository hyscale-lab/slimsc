Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector, probably in a 3-dimensional space, right? Because it's got three elements. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the states are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, and each component corresponds to an eigenstate of some observable.

The observable here is represented by matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, so that's a 3x3 matrix. I should probably write it out to visualize better.

So matrix P is:

[ 0        1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2      0        1/√2 ]
[ 0        1/√2      0     ]

Wait, I think I got that right. Each row is as given. Now, the question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. So I know that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable matrix. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

But wait, maybe
