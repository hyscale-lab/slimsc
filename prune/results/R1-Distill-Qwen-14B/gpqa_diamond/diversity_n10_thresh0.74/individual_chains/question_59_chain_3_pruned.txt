Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide, which is a strong base). Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how these react when mixed together and then find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that when an acid and a base are mixed, they can neutralize each other. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, I think I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see what's left after neutralization.

Let's break down each component.

Starting with acetic acid, CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for calculating the initial moles, I can just use the concentration and volume. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it will contribute some H+ ions, but I think I should handle it after considering the strong acid and base reactions because strong acids and bases will completely dissociate, affecting the pH more directly.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+ ion, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, when these are mixed together, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So I'll subtract the moles of each to see what's left.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

Which is more? OH- is more, so after neutralization, all H+ is consumed, and there will be OH- left. The excess OH- will determine the pH.

Calculating the neutralization: H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.08), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait a minute. There's also the acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So I can't just forget about that. Because when you mix solutions, the weak acid might react with the excess OH-.

So what's the process? Maybe I should first find out the net OH- or H+ after considering all reactions.

Let me think again.

Mixing all three solutions. Let's calculate the total volume first because the concentrations will change based on the total volume. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and any that might come from CH3COOH, but since the solution is probably basic, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with any H+.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's a strong source of OH-. HCl is a strong acid, so it's a strong source of H+. CH3COOH is weak, so it can provide some H+ but may also get neutralized.

So, after mixing, the strong acid and strong base will react first. Then, any remaining OH- or H+ will determine the solution's pH. Any weak acid will react with the excess OH- if there is any.

So let's compute the moles step by step.

Total H+ from strong acids (HCl):
0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

Total OH- from strong base (Ba(OH)2):
0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.0
