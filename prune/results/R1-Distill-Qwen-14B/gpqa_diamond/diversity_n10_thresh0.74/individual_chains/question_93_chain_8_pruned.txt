Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but I'll try to work it out.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in three technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect because that's the best you can get. The R² is 1, so that means the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope for a qPCR curve?

I remember that the slope of a qPCR standard curve is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is usually something like -3.32 if the efficiency is 100%, because the formula for efficiency is E = 10^(-1/slope), right? So with a slope of -3.3, that would give E ≈ 100%, which matches the question. So that's good, no problem there.

Looking at his results, each concentration has three technical replicates. For example, 100,000 copies gave Ct values of 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. Then, each subsequent dilution (10,000; 1,000; 100; 10 copies/μl) has lower Ct values, which makes sense because lower starting copies mean it takes longer (higher Ct) to reach the threshold. Wait, no, wait. Wait, higher copy numbers would reach the threshold faster, so lower Ct. Because if you have more copies, the fluorescence crosses the threshold sooner. So higher concentrations (like 100,000) would have lower Ct values, but wait, in the data given, 100,000 has Ct around 34, and 10 copies has Ct around 20. Oh wait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. Lower concentration, like 10 copies, would have fewer starting copies, take longer to amplify, so higher Ct. So in his data, the 100,000 copies have Ct of 34, and 10 copies have Ct of 20. That can't be right. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think I'm getting it backward. Let me clarify: Ct (threshold cycle) is the number of cycles needed for the fluorescence to cross a certain threshold. So if you have more copies, you reach that threshold earlier (lower Ct). So 100,000 copies would have lower Ct than 10 copies. But in the data, 100,000 has Ct around 34, while 10 has Ct 20.7. So that's the opposite. So that can't be right. Wait, that's a problem. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the way the data is presented.

Wait, maybe the data is presented in reverse. Let's read the question again. The first data point is 100,0
