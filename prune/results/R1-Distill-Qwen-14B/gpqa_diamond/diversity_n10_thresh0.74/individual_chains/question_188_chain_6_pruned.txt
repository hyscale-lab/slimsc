Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges of equal length, a = b = c, and all angles are equal, α = β = γ. Oh wait, in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between neighboring atoms along the unit cell edges, right? So that would mean a = 10 Å? Or wait, wait, maybe not exactly. Because sometimes interatomic distance could be the same as the lattice parameter for a cubic system, but rhombohedral is a bit different. Maybe I should proceed.

The interplanar distance, which is the distance between adjacent planes (hkl), is given by the formula 1/d = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Wait, no, I think for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula for d-spacing is different. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system where a = b = c and angles between axes are all equal is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (some terms involving the angles)

Wait no,
