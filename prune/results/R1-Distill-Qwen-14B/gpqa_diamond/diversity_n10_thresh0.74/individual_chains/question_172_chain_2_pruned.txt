Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be described by the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g is the statistical weights, E is energy, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh right, and in this case, the energy difference (E_i - E_j) is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

So the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. I think this means the ratio n1/n2 is 2, where n1 is the population of the excited state in star_1 and n2 in star_2. But wait, no, wait. The question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited—so perhaps n1 is twice n2? Or maybe the excitation potential is higher, so they are more excited? Hmm.

Wait, the ratio given is for the same energy difference. So E_i - E_j is the same for both stars, let's say ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star, we can write the ratio n_i/n_j as:

n1/nj1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

Similarly, n2/nj2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Wait, but the question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So maybe the ratio n1/n2 is 2? Or is it the ratio of the populations for each star? Maybe I should see what's given.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. So n1 = 2 *
