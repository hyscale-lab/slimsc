Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically involving the matrix exponential function and fractional approximation.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down what I know. Heat equations are partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe how heat distributes itself over time in a given region. Solving them numerically often involves discretizing the domain and using methods like finite differences to approximate the solutions.

The question mentions higher order finite difference approximations, which I think means they're using more accurate methods than the standard finite difference. Higher order methods usually provide better accuracy for the same grid size, reducing the error terms.

Parallel splitting must refer to domain decomposition or some kind of parallel algorithm where the problem is split into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously. I remember that for some PDEs, especially those that can be written in a form involving matrix exponentials, there's a way to parallelize the solution by splitting the time integration or spatial operators.

The matrix exponential comes into play when solving systems of linear differential equations. For example, the solution to a system du/dt = Au is u(t) = e^(At)u0. In the context of PDEs, this might represent the evolution of the solution over time.

Fractional approximation probably refers to methods like the Padé approximant, which is a way to approximate functions (like the exponential function) using rational functions. Padé approximants can provide good numerical stability and accuracy. So, the matrix exponential is being approximated by a fractional (rational function) approximation.

The key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one would relate to how the approximation allows for parallel computation. I'm trying to remember what makes an algorithm parallelizable. Stability analysis (option A) is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but it's more about the method's validity rather than its parallelization.

Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (option B) might affect the setup of the problem, but I'm not sure how that ties into parallelism. Nonlocal conditions could complicate the equations, but I don't see the direct link to parallel splitting.

Complex roots of fractional approximation (option C) – wait, Padé approximants can sometimes have poles, which are like complex roots in the denominator. If the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the stability or the ability to split the problem. Alternatively, maybe this relates to how the approximation can be decomposed into parts that can be computed in parallel.

Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation (option D) – partial fraction decomposition is a technique used to break down complex fractions into simpler parts. For example, if a function can be written as a sum of simpler terms, each of which can be computed independently, then that might allow for parallel processing. So if the fractional approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that don't interfere with each other, you could compute each term in parallel.

Wait, so if the approximation has a linear partial fraction decomposition, that might mean it can be split into independent parts. That would allow for parallel computation because each part can be handled by a different processor or thread.

Alternatively, complex roots might complicate things, but partial fractions could enable decomposition.
