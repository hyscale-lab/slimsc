Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says that a Pi-plus (π⁺) is stationary and decays into a mu-plus (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Wait, the neutrino is massless? Or does it have a negligible mass? I think for these kinds of problems, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, so maybe we can treat it as zero.

So the reaction is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the final particles must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and the neutrino will have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Because the pion is at rest, the total energy of the system is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy (which is zero in this approximation).

Let me try to write down the conservation equations.

Conservation of energy:
E_π = E_μ + E_ν
E_π is the energy of the pion, which is its rest mass energy since it's at rest: 139.6 MeV.

E_μ is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy: E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. Wait, but in particle physics units, we usually set c=1, so E_μ = m_μ + K_μ.

Similarly, E_ν is the energy of the neutrino, which is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible: E_ν = K_ν.

So putting this into the energy equation:
139.6 = (105.7 + K_μ) + K_ν.

Conservation of momentum:
The pion is at rest, so total initial momentum is zero. So the vectors of the muon's momentum and the neutrino's momentum must cancel each other out. So |p_μ| = |p_ν|, but they are in opposite directions. So their magnitudes are equal.

The momentum of each particle is related to their energy and mass via the relation:
E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

Again, setting c=1 for simplicity, this becomes:
E² = p² + m².

So for the muon:
E_μ² = p_μ² + (105.7)^2.

And for the neutrino:
E_ν² = p_ν² + (0)^2 → E_ν = p_ν.

Since their momenta are equal in magnitude, p_μ = p_ν = p (let's say p is the magnitude).

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the muon's momentum
