Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering usually means that the kinetic energy is conserved, right? But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that scattering amplitude is related to something called the optical theorem or maybe partial waves. Phase shifts must come into play here.

The given phase shifts are δ_o=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, and δ_4=13°. And we're to ignore the rest, so maybe higher order terms don't contribute much. Wait, the phase shifts here are for different angular momenta, right? Like δ_l for each l.

The scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) in the case of elastic scattering can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The general formula I think is f(s,θ,φ) = Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} / (something). Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the formula is f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }, but I'm not exactly sure about the factors here. Wait, I think the actual expression for the scattering amplitude is (from memory):

f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}

But since the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Along the incident beam, the scattering angle θ would be 0°, because the particle comes in along the beam direction, which is usually taken as the z-axis. So cosθ = 1.

But wait, wait, the phase shifts are given for l=0 to 4, I think. So we need to sum over l=0 to 4, since the rest are ignored.

Wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. So we'll consider l from 0 to 4.

Now, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Hmm. The scattering amplitude
