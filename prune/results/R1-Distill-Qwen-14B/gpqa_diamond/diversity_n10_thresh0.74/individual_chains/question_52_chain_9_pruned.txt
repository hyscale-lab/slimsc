Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Hmm, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, but I'm not sure how the spots affect the temperature. Oh right, spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the star decreases.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Okay, so the ratio (let's call it R) of level 1 to level 2 is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? Because in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is determined by temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: 

n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in levels i and j,
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors),
- E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K. But wait, the spots cover 40% of the surface. So is the overall T the average of the spotted and unspotted regions? Hmm, the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So I think the given T here is the average effective temperature of the entire star, not just the spotted regions.

Wait, but does the presence of spots affect the observed spectrum in a specific way? Like, the spots are cooler, so they emit less flux. But the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think that the T we should use is 6000 K and 5500 K in the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The effective temperature is the temperature that the star would have if it were a blackbody. The presence of spots (which are cooler) would lower the overall effective temperature. So when 40% of the surface is spots, the star's effective temp is 5500 K. So in the photosphere, the overall temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Without spots, T_eff is 6000 K. So when spots cover part of the surface, the overall T_eff goes down to 55
