Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Wait, wait, the numbering might be different. Let me see: the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are arranged in a meta fashion relative to each other? Or maybe ortho? Let me think about the numbering. Oh, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are consecutive. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, which are adjacent. Wait, that's not possible because benzene is a ring and adjacent substituents would be ortho. But in this case, it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So, looking at the structure, perhaps the nitro is in position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy in position 1, and the tert-butyl is in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is in position 1, the tert-butyl in position 2, and the nitro in position 3. So, they're all adjacent. Wait, but that would make it 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with those groups. Hmm, but maybe it's better to approach this by thinking about how to add the substituents in the correct order.

When synthesizing aromatic compounds with multiple substituents, the order of addition is crucial because each substitution affects the next due to directing effects. So, benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. Each substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions.

The substituents in the target molecule are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3), and nitro (NO2
