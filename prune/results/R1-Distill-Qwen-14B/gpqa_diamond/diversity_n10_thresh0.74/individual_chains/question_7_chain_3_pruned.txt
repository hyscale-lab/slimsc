Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which is this afterglow from the Big Bang, right? So the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

The problem is asking at what gamma-ray energy their lifetimes would be limited by this annihilation process. The options are in the range of GeV, which is a billion electron volts. So it's about high-energy gamma-rays here.

I think I need to apply some physics here. So, when a gamma-ray photon interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. The cross-section for this process probably matters, and the lifetime of the gamma-ray would depend on how often this interaction occurs. If the interaction happens quickly, the lifetime is short; if not, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, the lifetime of a photon is determined by the probability of it interacting (like annihilation) as it travels through the universe. So the mean lifetime τ is related to the interaction probability. The probability of a photon interacting is given by the product of the cross-section (σ) and the number of target photons (n). So the interaction rate Γ would be σ * n. Then, the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of Γ: τ = 1/Γ = 1/(σ * n).

But wait, actually, the photon's lifetime is how long it can travel before annihilating. So the mean free path is c * τ, where c is the speed of light. But the problem is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So I think the key is to find the energy where the annihilation rate becomes significant.

Let me think about the cross-section for γγ → e+ e-. I remember that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. At high energies, the cross-section increases. The basic formula for the cross-section when two photons collide is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s)) * (m_e^2)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the typical cross-section formula for pair production.

Wait, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs
