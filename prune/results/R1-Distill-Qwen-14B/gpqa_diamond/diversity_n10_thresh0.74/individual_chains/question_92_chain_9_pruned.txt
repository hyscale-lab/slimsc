Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific hydrocarbon. Hmm, the molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

Wait, right, enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method to calculate it. Oh right, I think it's using bond energies. So the approach is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and then the energy released when forming bonds in the product.

Wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is that the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. The formula is ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products). But wait, wait, no, because when bonds are broken in the reactants, you have to add their energies, and when bonds are formed in the products, you subtract their energies. Or is it the other way around? I get confused sometimes.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is calculated by considering the energy change when the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms. So I need to calculate the total bond energies of the reactants (the elements) and subtract the bond energies of the product (the molecule in question).

Wait, but the elements here are
