Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo. The question is asking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, the formula for that. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but wait, no, orbital period relates to distance. Because Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). So period squared is proportional to a cubed.

So if the periods are in a ratio, then the distances can be found by taking the cube root of the period ratios. But wait, since the period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, let me index them as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. So P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5.

Since the orbital periods are in a ratio, the semi-major axes (distance from star) will be in the ratio of (P_i)^(2/3). Because from Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for Planet 2, P2=2, so a2 = (2)^(2/3). Similarly, Planet 4 has P4=3.5, so a4 = (3.5)^(2/3).

But wait, since the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance, and the albedo is the same for all, the temperature ratio between two planets would be inverse proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances. Because the formula is T = T_star * ( (L/(16πσ D^2)) )^(1/
