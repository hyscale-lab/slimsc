Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it.

The question describes a decay process: 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and some emitted particles. The E and V are much lighter than the nucleons, which probably means their rest mass is negligible compared to A and B. It's also given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant decay where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is asking how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes in this new scenario.

Hmm. I remember that when particles are emitted in a decay, their energy distribution depends on the conservation laws—like conservation of energy and momentum. Also, in two-body decays, the energy spectrum can be continuous if there's more than one possible product. But wait, in this case, the decay is a bit more complex because it's a multi-body decay.

In the original decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V), each E and V must carry away some energy and momentum. Since E and V are much lighter, maybe they are like beta particles or something similar. But the key part is the energy spectrum of E.

In the original case, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That probably happens because in a multi-body decay, each emitted particle can take a range of energies, leading to a continuous distribution. The endpoint Q would be the maximum energy that an E particle can have, which occurs when all the available energy is given to a single E. But wait, in two-body decays, like beta decay, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the antineutrino carries away some energy. So maybe in the original decay, it's similar—each E and V carry away variable amounts, leading to a continuous spectrum for E.

Now, in the variant decay, two V's are replaced by a single M, which is massless. So the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Let's think about what that means for
