Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about particles being collided in a detector. So, they create new particles that move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma relates to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. But wait, in this context, particles are moving through the detector, so maybe it's about the time it takes for them to reach the inner walls.

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying. So, the key here is probably the lifetime of the particles. Because if they decay before reaching the detector's walls, fewer of them will make it. So, the number that reach the walls depends on their speed, which affects their lifetime due to time dilation.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. So, the distance each particle needs to travel to reach the wall is 30 meters. But wait, if the detector is spherical, the particles are moving in all directions, but the ones reaching the walls would be those that don't decay before traveling 30 meters.

So, the problem is about the proper lifetime of the particle and how it's affected by the Lorentz factor. Because from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particle's lifetime is longer due to gamma. So, the longer the lifetime, the more particles will survive to reach the wall.

Wait, but the problem mentions that under a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third reach the walls. And we need to find the gamma when two-thirds reach. So, the gamma must be higher to make more particles reach.

Let me model this. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. The particles will decay with a certain probability, which depends on whether their lifetime exceeds the time it takes to reach the wall.

So, the time taken to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic
