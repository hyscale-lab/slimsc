Okay, so I've got this question about stars detectable by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

The question asks which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that the detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the stars. Oh right, because the brightness as seen from Earth (apparent magnitude) determines whether a telescope can observe it.

The problem gives some info: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So any star fainter than 16 mag would be observable only by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the easier it is to detect. So HIRES can't see stars fainter than 16 mag, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star that's brighter than 17 mag (but wait, no, wait: I'm getting confused about whether higher magnitude means brighter or fainter. Oh, right, higher magnitude is fainter. So a V magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So HIRES can see stars up to 16, which is brighter than what ESPRESSO can't see (beyond 17). So a star with apparent magnitude 16.5 is observable by both? Or wait, no: because HIRES can observe up to 16, so 16.5 is fainter than 16, so only ESPRESSO can see it. Wait, no, the cutoff is 'brighter than 17', so a star brighter than 17 (so magnitude less than 17) can be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, the question says: 'stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed'. Oh, wait, the way it's phrased is confusing. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning, Mv <17, then ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, brighter than 16, so Mv <16.
