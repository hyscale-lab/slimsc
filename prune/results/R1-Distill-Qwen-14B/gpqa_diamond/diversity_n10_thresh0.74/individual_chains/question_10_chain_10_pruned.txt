Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are labeled A to D, each corresponding to a different planet.

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh right, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each pointing to one of these. So I need to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. So if I can figure out the mass and radius (to find volume) for each exoplanet, I can compute their densities.

Let me list out each option:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
So, mass is same as Earth, radius same as Earth. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.
Wait, but if the density is given as 5.5, then that's the answer for this one. But wait, density is given, so perhaps this is straightforward. But wait, does the mass affect the density? Since density is given directly, maybe this planet's density is 5.5 as well. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let's parse each option.

Option a: Earth mass, Earth radius. So same as Earth. So density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, but the density is 5.5. So that's the same as Earth. But wait, that can't make sense. Because if a planet has more mass but same density, that means its radius would be larger. Because density is mass/volume, and volume depends on radius. Let me think: if the radius increases, volume increases as radius cubed. So if mass is 2 times, but density same as Earth, then volume would be 2/(5.5) times Earth's volume? Wait, no. Because density = mass/volume. So if density is same, 5.5, then mass is 2 * Earth's mass.

So 5.5 = (2M_earth) / V => V = (2M_earth) / 5.
