Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically whether they're cis or trans.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). I need to match this data to the correct structure among the four options.

Hmm, so let's recall what these structures look like. Acetates are esters, so the general structure is R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate is OAc, so in an ester like propenyl acetate, it would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-O-CH3? Wait no, wait. Acetate is CH3COO-. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, wait: the ester is formed from an alcohol and acetic acid. So, for example, propenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2... Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester is CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2-? No, wait, wait. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure in another way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structures. Let me think. Acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the alkyl or alkenyl group. So if the R group is propenyl, that would be CH2CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? No, wait, because the propenyl could be either CH2=CH2-CH2- or CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2, but wait, propenyl is an allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, but in the acetate ester, the propenyl group would be attached to the oxygen. So the structure would be
