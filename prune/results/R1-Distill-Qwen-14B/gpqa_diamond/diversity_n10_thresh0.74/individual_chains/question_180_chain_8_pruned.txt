Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right, so 2e means twice that. The problem says the system is isolated, so no external forces or energy transfers, I guess.

So 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, and it's giving me options in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Wait, wait. I think I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Because that's the energy stored due to the arrangement of charges. And since the system is isolated, the potential energy would be the minimum when the charges are arranged in a way that the total potential energy is minimized. Or wait, is there another factor here?

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the setup is that there's a central charge at point P, and 12 charges all located 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from P.

So the system consists of two parts of potential energy: the energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Oh right, because each pair of charges contributes to the total potential energy.

But wait, when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.
