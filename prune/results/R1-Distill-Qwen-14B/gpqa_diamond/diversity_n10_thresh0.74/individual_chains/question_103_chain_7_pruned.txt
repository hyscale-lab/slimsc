Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which one gives the right product in high yield.

First, let me parse the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), so the ketone is at position 1. The substituents on the phenyl ring are at positions 3 and 5: bromo and nitro groups, respectively. So the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, no, actually, 3-bromo and 5-nitro would place them in the meta positions relative to each other. Because on a benzene ring, positions 3 and 5 are two positions apart, which is meta.

So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). The ketone is attached at position 1, so that's the ortho position relative to the nitro group. Wait, let me visualize this. Benzene is a ring. Let's number the positions: 1 is where the ketone is attached, then 3 is two positions away (so meta), and 5 is opposite, I think. Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, positions are numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is at position 1, the nitro group at 5, and the bromo at 3. So, 1 is attached to the ketone, and 3 and 5 are the other substituents. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, no, wait. No, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. So the benzene ring is the phenyl substituent attached to the ketone. So the substit
