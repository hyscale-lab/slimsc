Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so maybe that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. But wait, I think the quantum rotation-vibration model involves both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model probably considers the rotational energy levels as well as the vibrational ones.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that usually refers to the ground state, but maybe in this context, it's the lowest energy state considering both rotation and vibration. So when a photon is absorbed, it should transition to the next lowest energy state. But what exactly is the next state? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe the bond length isn't fixed. But perhaps the rotational part is still considered separately from the vibrational part.

Oh, but the problem gives me an angular frequency for vibration, w = 4e14 rad/s. So that's about the vibrational part. And the options are about momentum, which is related to the photon's energy because p_photon = E_photon / c, since photons carry energy E = pc (for massless particles).

Wait, so when a
