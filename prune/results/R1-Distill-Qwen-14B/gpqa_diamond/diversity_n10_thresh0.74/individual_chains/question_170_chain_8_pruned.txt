Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, right? So the state (3i, 4) must be a column vector with components 3i and 4.

Wait, wait, expectation value. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator, multiplied again by the state. Or maybe it's the bra-ket notation, like <ψ|Ô|ψ>.

Right, so for S_y, the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. Oh wait, σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. But wait, to compute the expectation value, I need to take the conjugate transpose of ψ, which means I take the complex conjugate of each component and then transpose it. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 remains 4. So the bra vector is [-3i, 4].

So the expectation value <S_y> is the bra vector multiplied by the operator S_y and then multiplied by the ket vector. Alternatively, it's (ψ†) S_y ψ.

Wait, let me make sure. Another approach is to compute ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ, and then multiply the whole thing by ħ/2. Yes, that's right.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

Breaking it down step by step. First, write out ψ† as a row vector: [-3i, 4].

σ_y is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So ψ† σ_y would be the product of the row vector and σ_y matrix. Let me compute that.

Multiplying ψ† (row) by σ_y (matrix):

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i)
