Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions—basic and acidic. The statement is incomplete: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

Hmm. I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to undergo reduction. So, a stronger oxidant has a higher tendency to be reduced. The thermodynamic part probably refers to the standard reduction potentials. In basic solutions, maybe the potential changes, affecting the oxidant strength.

Wait, oxygen is involved in redox reactions. In acidic conditions, oxygen's reduction is more favorable. Like, O2 + 4H+ + 2e- → 2H2O. That's a standard reaction. The standard reduction potential for this is around +1.23 V. But in basic solutions, the same reaction would have H2O instead of H+. So the equation would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. What's the standard potential for that? I think it's about +0.40 V.

So, the thermodynamic favorability depends on the potential. A higher E° means more favorable as an oxidizer. So in acidic solution, the reduction potential is higher, making O2 a stronger oxidant there. But in basic solution, the potential is lower, so O2 is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." Oh, right, so in basic solutions, the E° is lower. So O2 isn't as strong an oxidant in basic as in acidic. So the first blank is 'weaker' because the E° is lower.

Now the kinetic part. Kinetics refers to the speed of reaction. O2 in acidic solutions: how does the reaction speed compare? Maybe because the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable in acidic conditions, it might proceed faster. But wait, what factors affect reaction rate? Things like concentration, temperature, catalysts, and the reaction mechanism.

Alternatively, sometimes even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it might be kinetically slow because of a high activation energy. But oxygen's reactions can be influenced by factors like the presence of catalysts or the concentration of H+ ions.

Wait, the question says "kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." So is it faster or slower? I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about catalysis. In acidic solutions, maybe the reaction has a catalyst that makes it proceed faster. Or perhaps in basic solutions, the reaction is slower because the necessary protons aren't as available for the reaction mechanism.

Alternatively, think about the reaction's activation energy. In acidic conditions, the reaction might have a lower activation energy because of the presence of H+ ions which can stabilize transition states. Or perhaps in some cases, the reaction in basic solution is slower because of the higher pH affecting the reaction steps.

Wait, another approach: the thermodynamic part is about being a stronger or weaker oxidant. The kinetic part is about the rate of reaction. So in basic solutions, the oxidant is weaker thermodynamically. But how does that affect the kinetics? Perhaps because in basic solutions, the reverse reaction (maybe oxidation) is less favorable, so the forward reaction doesn't proceed as fast. Or maybe because the reaction conditions (like higher pH) make the reaction slower.

Wait, but the question is specifically about how oxygen reacts. In acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed faster because of higher concentration of H+ ions, which could facilitate the electron transfer steps. Or perhaps in basic conditions, the reaction is slower due to the lower concentration of H+ ions which are needed as catalysts in some redox steps.

Alternatively, think about the reaction rates in different pH conditions. For example, the reaction of O2 with something else might be influenced by the availability of H+ ions. In acidic solution, H+ is abundant, which could make the reaction proceed faster. So, the reaction in acidic solution would be faster kinetically.

Putting it together: Thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant because its E° is lower. Kinetically, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because of the higher H+ concentration aiding the reaction mechanism.

So, the first part is 'weaker', the second part is 'faster'. Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → No, first wrong.

B) stronger – slower → No.

C) weaker – faster → Yes, this fits.

D) weaker - slower → No for the second part.

Wait, but wait. The question is about O2 as an oxidant. In acidic solutions, O2 is a stronger oxidant. So in basic, it's weaker. So the first blank is 'weaker'. The kinetic part is about how O2 reacts in acidic solutions—faster or slower. So if the reaction is more favorable, does that mean it's faster? Not necessarily, because kinetics and thermodynamics are separate. However, higher reaction rates can sometimes be due to better conditions for the transition state.

Alternatively, perhaps in acidic solutions, oxygen's reactions are faster because of the presence of H+ ions, which can facilitate the reaction. For example, in the reaction O2 + 4H+ + 2e- → 2H2O, the H+ ions might help stabilize the transition state, making the reaction proceed faster.

So the correct combination is weaker (thermodynamic) and faster (kinetic). So the right option is C: weaker – faster.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions, focusing on thermodynamic and kinetic factors.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The reduction potential of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the reduction reaction is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} $$  
   with a standard reduction potential \( E^\circ \approx +1.23 \, \text{V} \).  
   In basic solutions, the reaction is:  
   $$ \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- $$  
   with a standard reduction potential \( E^\circ \approx +0.40 \, \text{V} \).  
   Since the reduction potential is lower in basic solutions, oxygen is a **weaker oxidant** thermodynamically in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetics refers to the speed of the reaction. In acidic solutions, the presence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can facilitate the reaction mechanism, potentially lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. Additionally, the higher concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in acidic solutions can stabilize intermediates and transition states, further enhancing the reaction rate. Thus, oxygen reacts **faster** kinetically in acidic solutions.

3. **Combining the Results**:  
   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. The correct combination is "weaker – faster."

4. **Evaluating the Options**:  
   - **A) stronger – faster**: Incorrect, as oxygen is not a stronger oxidant in basic solutions.  
   - **B) stronger – slower**: Incorrect, as oxygen is not a stronger oxidant in basic solutions, and the reaction is not slower in acidic solutions.  
   - **C) weaker – faster**: Correct, as explained above.  
   - **D) weaker – slower**: Incorrect, as the reaction is faster in acidic solutions.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.  

Answer: C
