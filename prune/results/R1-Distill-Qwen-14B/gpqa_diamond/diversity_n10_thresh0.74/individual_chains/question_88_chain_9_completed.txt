Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? So the setup is that they've tagged the inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivered them to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging and observed some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. The question is which process is taking place.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is involved in mucosal immunity. They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when the GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are given orally, they probably get taken up by these patches.

Fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid would mean that not all the proteins make it through. But some do reach the Peyer's patches. Then, in those patches, the fluorescent cells are proliferating. When they sequence the variable heavy chain genes and see high variability, that makes me think of processes that generate diversity in antibodies.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each option. VDJ recombination occurs during the generation of the immune receptor genes during lymphocyte development. It's a process where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to create a vast diversity of receptors. This happens in the bone marrow for B cells and in the thymus for T cells. So if VDJ were happening, it would be more about initial diversity creation, not so much about the variability after an immune response is triggered.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs after the initial immune response. It introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptors, increasing the diversity of antibodies. This happens in germinal centers, where B cells undergo proliferation and mutation. So when the B cells are proliferating and their variable regions are changing, that's somatic hypermutation.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response. It's about opsonizing pathogens and causing lysis, but I don't think it's directly related to the variability in the heavy chain genes. Complement is more about the destruction of pathogens rather than the generation of diverse antibodies.

Class switching recombination, also known as isotype switching, is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). This involves the rearrangement of the heavy chain gene segments, but it doesn't add variability to the variable region. It's more about using different constant regions.

In the question, the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. So it's about changes in the variable regions, which would be somatic hypermutation. That's process A.

Let me go through the scenario again. The GFP-tagged proteins are delivered orally. Some are destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach has a low pH. The ones that make it through the mucus (like in the small intestine) would be taken up by the Peyer's patches. In these patches, the antigen-presenting cells (like M cells) would present the antigen to B cells, initiating an immune response.

Once the B cells are activated, they go to the germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process increases the diversity of the antibodies produced, allowing for a more specific and effective immune response. So the high variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains is because of this process.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial B cell activation and is a key part of the adaptive immune response, leading to affinity maturation. So the correct answer should be A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of these proteins is partially destroyed by stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but some reach the Peyer's patches, a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In these patches, fluorescent cells are observed to proliferate, and sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen and initiating immune responses. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors. Among the options:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during the initial generation of immune receptor diversity during lymphocyte development, not during an immune response.
- **Complement activation** is part of the innate immune response and does not involve variability in antibody genes.
- **Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody produced but does not add variability to the variable region of the heavy chain.
- **Somatic hypermutation** introduces point mutations in the variable region of B cell receptors, increasing diversity and affinity during the immune response. This process occurs in germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and mutate.

Given the context of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes and the role of Peyer's patches in initiating immune responses, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
