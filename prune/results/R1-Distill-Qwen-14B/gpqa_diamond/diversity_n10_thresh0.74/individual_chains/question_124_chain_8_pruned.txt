Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector and Lorentz factors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. So, the problem states that one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Wait, so initially, with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, only one third make it. But we want two-thirds to make it, so the required gamma must be higher than 20. Because higher gamma would mean the particles are moving faster, right? So they should be able to travel further before decaying, meaning more would reach the detector walls.

So, the problem is about the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance a particle travels before decaying. I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime (t) is gamma times tau. So t = gamma * tau.

But wait, the particles are moving at a speed close to the speed of light. So the time they take to reach the detector walls depends on their speed and the detector's radius.

Let me think. The detector has a radius R of 30 meters. So the distance from the center to the wall is 30 m. The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So t â‰ˆ R / c.

But wait, the actual time the particle can travel before decaying is gamma * tau. So for the particle to reach the wall, gamma * tau must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall, which is R/(v). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the particle's lifetime is extended by gamma, so the maximum distance it can travel is v * gamma * tau.

Ah, right. The maximum distance D a particle can travel before decaying is v multiplied by its lifetime. Since the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, D = v * gamma tau.
