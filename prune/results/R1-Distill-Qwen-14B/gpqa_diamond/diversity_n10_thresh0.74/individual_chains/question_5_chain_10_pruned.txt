Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you can express it as a combination of the standard basis operators. Like, if the direction is along a unit vector n, which is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz). Oh wait, but since it's in x-z, the y-component is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, and phi would be 0 since it's in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the operator along direction n is P · n. Which would be P_x * nx + P_z * nz, since ny is zero. So, P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. So let's write down each:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator in the direction n is:

P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z = (ħ/2)(nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]])

So, putting it together, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Wait, let me compute that again. nx is sinθ, nz is cosθ because n is in the x-z plane, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
           [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So, the matrix form is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * |v> = (1) |v>

Because when you factor out ħ/2, the equation becomes (ħ/2) * matrix * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, so matrix * |v> = |v>.

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Where |v> is [a, b]^T.

Wait, no. The matrix is multiplied by the vector (a, b), so:

[ (cosθ a + sinθ b ), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = [ a, b ]

So, this gives two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a

2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a =0 → a (cosθ -1) + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b =0 → sinθ a - b (cosθ +1) =0

So, from equation 2:

sinθ a = b (cosθ +1 )

So, a = [ b (cosθ +1 ) ] / sinθ

Wait, but maybe I should write these equations differently.

Equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → [ (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ] a = b 

Equation 2: sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → [ sinθ/(1 + cosθ) ] a = b 

Wait, because equation 2 comes from:

sinθ a - cosθ b =b → sinθ a = (1 + cosθ) b → a = [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] b 

Wait, so from equation 1:

(1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b → a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b 

Hmm, so from equation 1 and equation 2, [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b = [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ] b 

Assuming b is not zero, we can cancel b.

So:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ

Cross-multiplying:

sin^2θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) → sin^2θ = 1 - cos^2θ → Which is correct because sin^2θ + cos^2θ =1, so yes.

So the two equations are consistent. Therefore, we can set b in terms of a. Let's pick equation 2: a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b 

So, let me write a in terms of b. Let me express a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b 

So, the eigenvector is [a, b]^T = [ ( (1 + cosθ)/sinθ ) b , b ]^T

We can factor out b, and write the eigenvector as a scalar multiple of [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, 1 ]^T.

But we can also represent this as a scalar multiple. Let me compute (1 + cosθ)/sinθ: 

(1 + cosθ)/sinθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) = cot(theta/2) = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)]

So, the eigenvector can be written as [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T, or [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T multiplied by a scalar. Wait, perhaps I should look for a normalized eigenvector.

Wait, let's compute the normalization. The eigenvector is [a, b] = [ (1 + cosθ) b / sinθ, b ].

So, the vector is proportional to [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, 1 ]

Let me compute this as:

sqrt( [ (1 + cosθ)^2 / sin²θ + 1 ] ) = sqrt( (1 + 2 cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ ) / sin²θ )

Since sin²θ + cos²θ =1, this becomes sqrt( (2 + 2 cosθ ) / sin²θ )

Factor out 2:

sqrt( 2 (1 + cosθ) / sin²θ )

Which is sqrt(2 (2 cos²(theta/2)) ) / (2 sin²(theta/2)))

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities would help.

We know that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2)

and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So, [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] = [ 2 cos²(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] → [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] → cot(theta/2)

So, the vector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

The normalization factor N is sqrt( |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 )

Which is sqrt( (cos²(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2)) + 1 ) = sqrt( (cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2)) ) / sin²(theta/2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute |a|^2 + |b|^2:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ (cot(theta/2))^2 + 1 ] 

Which is [ (cos²(theta/2)/ sin²(theta/2)) ) + 1 ] = [ (cos² + sin²) / sin² ] = 1 / sin²(theta/2)

So, sqrt(1/sin²(theta/2)) ) = 1/sin(theta/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2), 1 ] multiplied by sin(theta/2), which gives:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Because:

cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

and 1 * sin(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, looking back, the operator was P along n, which is (nx, 0, nz). So the direction is in the x-z plane. The state we get is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would be the up state in spin along that direction.

Wait, but the question says to find the eigenvector, and the options are given in terms of hbar? Or are they just normalized?

Wait, the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". So the eigenvector is a unit vector, so I think hbar would not be part of the vector, because the eigenvectors are dimensionless in this context. Because operators are multiplied by hbar/2, but the eigenvectors should just be complex numbers with magnitude 1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which fits. Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar terms, which seems odd because the eigenvector should be normalized, but if hbar is involved, perhaps the vector's elements have units of hbar? Not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are just vectors in Hilbert space, which are dimensionless. So the presence of ħ in the options is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of ħ/2 multiplied by matrices. So the eigenvalue is ħ/2. So, the operator is (ħ/2) times a matrix. Therefore, the eigenvector equation
