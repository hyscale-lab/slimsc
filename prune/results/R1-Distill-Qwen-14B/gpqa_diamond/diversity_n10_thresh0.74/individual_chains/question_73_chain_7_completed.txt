Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Right, so I need to find two things: the relative speed from the perspective of one astronaut to the other and the total energy of the system.

Wait, for the relative speed, since they're moving in the same direction, I can't just subtract their speeds normally because of relativity. I remember that you can't just add or subtract velocities in special relativity because that would exceed the speed of light. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is different.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me get that straight. So v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Plugging in, that would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator first: 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which simplifies to 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = 0.142857... approximately 0.143c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now, the total energy part. For each astronaut, I need to calculate their relativistic energy and sum them up. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. So v = 0.6c. Beta is 0.6. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Beta is 0.5. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E is 5.96 mc² and v_rel is 0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less than our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. For the first astronaut: v=0.6c, beta squared is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root is 0.8, gamma is 1.25. So 1.25 * 2m c² is indeed 2.5 mc². Second astronaut: 0.5c gives beta squared 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Square root is about 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. Multiply by 3m: 3 * 1.1547 = 3.464. So total energy is 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964, which is about 5.96 mc².

So the options are looking at C: v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option B has E=4.96, which is less. So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. 

### Relative Speed
The relative speed formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1429c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut
Mass \(m_1 = 2m\), speed \(v_1 = 0.6c\). Calculate \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Energy of the first astronaut:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut
Mass \(m_2 = 3m\), speed \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Calculate \(\gamma\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

Energy of the second astronaut:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
