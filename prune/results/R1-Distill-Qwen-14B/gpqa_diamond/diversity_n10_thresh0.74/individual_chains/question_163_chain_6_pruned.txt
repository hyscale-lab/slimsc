Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When you add a strong acid to a hydroxide, they should react to form a salt and water. The salt here would be iron(III) sulfate or something similar, but wait, the acid is monobasic, so it's probably like HCl or H2SO4 but mono, so maybe HCl or HNO3.

Wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. So, the formula of the acid is HA (where A is the conjugate base). So when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HA, it should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Let me write the reaction:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HA → Fe(A)3 + 3 H2O

Wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. So, each OH- will react with a H+ from the acid. So the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Yes, that makes sense. So, the H+ from the acid will neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3.

Now, the problem gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how much H+ is required to dissolve all of it.

First, let's find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So each OH- group is 16 + 1 = 17 g/mol. There are three OH groups, so 3*17=51. Then Fe is 55.85, so total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is Fe with three OH groups. So the formula is Fe(OH)3. So molar mass is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) = 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol.

Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me write it as 9.36e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 provides 3 moles of OH- ions because it's Fe(OH)3. So the OH- moles would be 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But when the acid is added, each mole of H+ will neutralize one mole of OH-. So to completely dissolve Fe(OH)3, the number of H+ needed is 3 moles per mole of Fe(OH)3. Therefore, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Wait, no, because each Fe(OH)3 gives 3 OH-, so each requires 3 H+ to
