Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh wait, Pauli statistics come into play here. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T, S, and L are the isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the final NN state.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each involving a transition from the initial 1S0 state to a different state plus a particle (p, s, f, etc.)

Wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So the initial state is 1S0, which would mean S=0 because 2(0)+1=1, so 1S0. The L here is S, which is the orbital part—so L=0 for S state. J is 0, because it's the total angular momentum.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, their state changes. So the final state of the NN has T=0, and we have to look at the possible transitions based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me think about the given condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T is 0, the equation becomes 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. That is, S and L must be different—because if they were the same, their sum would be even, but we need an odd sum here. So S and L must have opposite parity (one even, the other odd).

Now, each option represents a possible transition where the NN system ends up in a certain state after emitting X. Let's look at each option.

Option A: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. Wait, the
