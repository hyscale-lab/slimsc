Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. They give stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

Wait, what's the structure of the complexes here? I think cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The problem mentions dithiocyanato complexes, so maybe Co(SCN)_2^2+? But I'm not entirely sure about the charges. Let me think.

Cobalt(II) is Co^2+. Thiocyanate is SCN^−. So each complex would have a charge based on the number of SCN− ions attached. For example, Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) perhaps? Or maybe it's Co(SCN)_n^(something else). Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the possible complexes and their stoichiometry.

Wait, the problem mentions "dithiocyanato," which suggests two SCN- ligands. So perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Let's think about the possible complexes and their stability constants.

The stability constants (β) are given for β1, β2, β3, β4. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's denote the complexes as Co(SCN)_n^m+ where n is the number of SCN− ions attached. The general formation would be stepwise, so β1 would be for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no, actually, the overall stability constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants. So, for example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2. Or wait
