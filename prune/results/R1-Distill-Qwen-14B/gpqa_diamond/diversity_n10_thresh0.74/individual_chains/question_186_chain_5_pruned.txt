Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific bicyclic compound. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Right, so the reaction typically forms another diene, which then might cyclize or something.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, let me draw this structure out in my mind. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered, but wait no, bicyclo[2.2.1] means there are two bridges. So the structure has a norbornane-like frameworkâ€”two carbons in one bridge, two in another, and one in the third. So, the compound is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The 'azabicyclo' part suggests that one of the bridgehead positions is nitrogen. Oh wait, in norbornane, the bridgehead carbons are positions 1 and 4, I think. So the nitrogen is at position 2? Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be different. Let me think: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the main ring is seven-membered
