Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents for each step. The first reaction starts with butan-2-one, which I think is methyl isopropyl ketone. Then it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes that product and reacts it with reagent B in water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed via nucleophilic substitution. Butan-2-one is a ketone, and maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would provide the cyanide ion, acting as a nucleophile. The ketone carbonyl is attacked, leading to an addition product. 

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN or something? Maybe after the initial addition, something else happens. Oh wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-, but let me imagine it. But the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, I think it would add to the carbonyl, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that seems right.

So the first step is the addition of cyanide to a ketone. The reaction condition for that is typically under acidic conditions. I remember that in the formation of cyanohydrins, which are these kinds of addition products, the ketone reacts with a nitrile (like HCN or NaCN
