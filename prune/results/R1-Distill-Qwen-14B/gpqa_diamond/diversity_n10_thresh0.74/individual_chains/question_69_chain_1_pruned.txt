Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. Alright, let's start by understanding what's being asked.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay. So, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame will be longer due to time dilation. Right, because of special relativity.

So, the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because energy E = γ m₀ c², so γ = E/(m₀ c²). But since both E and m₀ are given in GeV, perhaps we can ignore the c² since it's in natural units here.

Wait, but let me check the units. Oh yeah, in particle physics, often c is taken as 1, so the units work out. So, E is 27 GeV, and m₀ is 3.41 GeV. So γ is E/m₀ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 3.41 * 8 is about 27.28. Oh wait, that's close to 27. So 8 times 3.41 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So, maybe gamma is approximately 8? Let me compute it more accurately. 27 /3.41.

Let me compute this: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87=3.13. 3.41 *0.915 ≈ 3.13 (because 3.
