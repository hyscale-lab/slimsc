Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the problem is about an electron and a positron colliding, annihilating each other, and producing two photons. The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is about the angle between these two photons.

Hmm. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have equal and opposite charges, their annihilation must conserve both energy and momentum. Oh wait, but photons have momentum, so the total momentum after annihilation should be equal to the total momentum before.

Wait, so let's think about the initial setup. The electron is moving from the left, so let's say to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. Wait, no, wait: the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its direction is to the right. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so direction is to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the same axis.

Wait, but wait: Lorentz factor is gamma. So I need to think about their relativistic momenta.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2). But for each particle, their momentum p is gamma * m * v. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite in direction.

So, let's model this. Let's take the positive x-axis to the right. The electron is moving in the positive direction, and the positron in the negative.

First, I need to calculate the total momentum of the system before annihilation. Then, since momentum is conserved, the total momentum of the photons after annihilation must equal this.

But wait, the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron but opposite charge. So both the electron and positron have the same rest mass, m = m_e (electron mass). So m_e is about 9.1e-31 kg
