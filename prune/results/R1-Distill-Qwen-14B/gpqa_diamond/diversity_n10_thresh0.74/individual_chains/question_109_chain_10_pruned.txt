Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about bound systems of two nucleons emitting a particle, right? The question is about Pauli statistics and the conservation of angular momentum and parity. Oh boy, this sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the initial state is a 1S0 state of two nucleons. Wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, and J=0. Because 2S+1 is 1, so 1S0 is the same as S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. The problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what's T, S, and L here? T is the isospin of the NN system. S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Or maybe it's T_NN = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod 2? Because the question says NN refers to the state after emission.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find which partial wave is not allowed. The options are about different transitions, each producing a particle X with a certain angular momentum state (denoted by the lowercase letter p, s, etc.)

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what each part represents. Let's see: each option is 1S0 going to a state plus a particle. Like option A is 7D1 + p. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is a NN state (like 7D1) plus a particle X.

I think I need to check each option for two things: conservation of angular momentum and parity conservation. Also, the Pauli condition on isospin.

Wait, but in this case, the initial state is 1S0 (which is a state with two nucleons), and after emission of X, the final state is a different NN state. Hmm, because the question says the system emits a particle, so the NN would be in a different state plus the particle.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X. So after emission, the NN is in some state (the final state) and X is emitted as another particle. So the initial NN is 1S0, final NN is another state, and X is a separate particle.

So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and X is emitted. So the total initial state is 1S0 (for NN) and nothing else because X isn't there yet.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the initial state being the combined state of NN and X before emission, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the decay of the NN system into another NN state plus X.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to proceed by considering the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The initial state is 1S0 for NN. So initial angular momentum is L_initial =0, spin S_initial=0, J_initial=0. Because 1S0 is (2*0+1)S0, which is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0.

Then, when the system emits particle X, the final state is (NN in a certain state) plus X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0. The final state is NN in some state (like 7D1, etc.) plus X.

Wait, but in terms of the angular momentum, the initial state's angular momentum must match the sum of the final state's angular momenta. So the initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0 (since 1S0 has J=0). The final state has the NN state with angular momentum J_final (like 7D1 has J=1, since D is L=2, and I'm not sure about the spin part), plus the particle X which has its own angular momentum.

Wait, but wait. The angular momentum of the system must be conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J_initial =0. The final total angular momentum is J_NN + J_X, but wait, actually, since X is emitted, the total angular momentum after emission must equal J_initial. But since X is a separate particle, its angular momentum can vary as long as the sum matches the initial.

But perhaps the parity must also be conserved. The parity of the initial state is P_initial. The parity of the final state is P_final = P_NN * P_X. Wait, but in strong interactions, parity is conserved, so P_initial should equal P_final.

Wait, the parity of the initial state (NN in 1S0) is determined by the term symbol. The parity is (-1)^{L + S}, because parity for a two-body system is given by (-1)^{L + S}.

In the initial state, L=0, S=0. So parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

So the initial parity is +1.

In the final state, the parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. The NN state after emission has parity P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN + S_NN}, and X has intrinsic parity given as -1. So the total final parity is P_NN * (-1).

This should equal the initial parity, which is +1. So:

P_NN * (-1) = +1 → P_NN = -1.

So the parity of the final NN state must be -1.

So P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN + S_NN} = -1 → (-1)^{L_NN + S_NN} = -1 → L_NN + S_NN must be odd.

So L_NN + S_NN is 1 mod 2. That's one condition.

Also, from the Pauli condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So:

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

Wait, because 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L +1) mod 2 =0 → (S+L) mod2 +1 mod2 =0 → (S+L) mod2 =1. So same as the parity condition.

So both the parity condition and the Pauli condition are giving that S+L is odd. Which is consistent, so that's one condition.

Now, the other thing is to look at the angular momentum conservation. The initial J is zero, so the total angular momentum after emission must be zero. But wait, the initial system is the two nucleons, but when they emit X, the total angular momentum of the system (which is NN + X) must be the same as initial. But the initial J is zero. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN and X must be zero. But that can only happen if both have J=0, but that's probably not the case. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is the NN system in 1S0, so J_initial=0. The final state is NN in some state (say, with J1) and X in some state (with J2). The total angular momentum after would be the sum of J1 and J2. But since the initial J is zero, the sum J1 + J2 must also be zero. So J1 = -J2. But since angular momentum is a vector, their sum must be zero. But for this to be possible, J1 and J2 must be such that their vectors cancel. But for two particles, the only way is that J1 = J2 and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, this would require that J1 = J2 and that the state is symmetric under exchange, which might not be possible for different particles. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total angular momentum being zero, so the sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. Which would mean that J_NN = J_X, and they are opposite vectors, so their magnitudes are equal. But in quantum mechanics, you can't have a state where J_NN and J_X are zero unless both are zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think in terms of the possible options. Each option gives the final NN state
