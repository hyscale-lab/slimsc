Okay, so I have this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's a bit unusual. I remember that metrics usually describe the geometry of a space, and sometimes you can tell the type of surface by the form of the metric.

So first, I should probably analyze this metric to see what kind of surface it describes. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, that reminds me of the equation of a circle. Because x² + y² = 4 would be a circle with radius 2. So maybe this metric is defined on some surface related to a sphere?

Wait, but the metric is in terms of dx² + dy², which suggests we're in two dimensions. So perhaps this is a 2-dimensional surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space or something else.

Wait a second, I think this might be a metric on a hyperbolic space. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the metric often has terms that look a bit different. Alternatively, it could be a sphere if the denominator is positive.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the form of the metric. The line element is ds² = (something) (dx² + dy²). So if the something is a function of x and y, then it's conformally flat, meaning the metric is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric.

So, the function is 32/(4 - x²
