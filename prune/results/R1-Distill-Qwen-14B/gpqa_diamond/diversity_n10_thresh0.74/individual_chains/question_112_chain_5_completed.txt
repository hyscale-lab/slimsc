Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about an electron's state and some probability and expectation value calculations.

First, let me read the problem again. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis, right? That makes sense. 

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, I think that would mean A is a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, in matrix form, it would look like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, no, wait a second. The problem states that A_ij = hbar/2 if i is different from j. So, it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since up and down are spin states). So, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2.

But wait, that matrix isn't Hermitian, is it? Because the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are the same. Oh wait, no, actually, it's Hermitian because the matrix is symmetric. Because hbar/2 is real, so the transpose is the same as the original matrix. So, A is a Hermitian operator, which makes sense because observables must have Hermitian matrices.

Wait, but what's the significance of this operator? Oh, because it's a Hermitian matrix, its eigenstates will form a basis for the Hilbert space, and any state can be expressed in terms of its eigenstates. So, when the problem says the eigenstates of this operator, I'll need to find those first.

Wait, but before that, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, I think I should first normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. To find the normalization constant, we calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself. So, <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating each term:

|1+i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5.

So sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional, so it's (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>].

So, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is to find the eigenstates of the operator A. The matrix A is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So, for a 2x2 matrix, it's:

[ 0       hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix, but maybe it's expressed in a different basis? Let me think. Because the eigenstates of A would probably be the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, or something similar. Because the matrix I'm seeing looks like the Pauli matrices scaled by something. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our matrix A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because:

Pauli X: [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, A = (hbar/2) * σ_x. So, the eigenvalues of A would be ±hbar/2. Because the eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so when multiplied by hbar/2, they become ±hbar/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

But wait, let me confirm. The eigenstates of σ_x are actually the superpositions that are eigenstates of the operator. So, for σ_x, the eigenstates are (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), but since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down, it's the same idea.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, which are these combinations. So, any state can be written as a combination of these eigenstates.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. That is, when you measure A, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when you express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, then the coefficients' magnitudes squared will give the probabilities.

So, step by step:

1. Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.
2. Compute the coefficients for each eigenstate.
3. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients.
4. Then, the average value of the operator A is the expectation value <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in its eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Let me proceed.

First, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

We have:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

We know that:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me distribute the terms inside:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|−x> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Combine like terms:

The coefficient for |+x> is (1+i) + (2 - i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

The coefficient for |−x> is (1+i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + 2i.

So, putting it all together:

|alpha> = [ 3|+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ]

Because 1/sqrt(2) times 1/sqrt(7) is 1/sqrt(14).

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Now, the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) for |+x> and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14) for |−x>.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Hmm, when I combined (1+i) and (2-i) for |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i. That's correct.

For |−x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = -1 + 2i. Correct.

So, now, the probability of measuring |+x> is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14).

Similarly, the probability for |−x> is |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2. Let's compute that.

The numerator is (-1 + 2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/(14).

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see these fractions. Let me compute 9/14 as approximately 0.6428, which is ~0.64, and 5/14 is ~0.357, which is ~0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36 as probabilities. That seems to match.

But wait another thought: am I sure that the probabilities are |c+|^2 and |c−|^2? Because |alpha> is expressed as a combination of |+x> and |−x>, which are orthonormal, so yes, the probabilities are the squares.

So, the first part gives probabilities 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36). Next, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, and the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So, the expectation value would be (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = [9/14 -5/14 ] * hbar/2 = (4/14) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * hbar/2 = (2/7) * (hbar/2) = hbar/7.

Wait, because 9/14 is the probability of +hbar/2, and 5/14 is the probability of -hbar/2.

So,

Expectation value = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ]*(hbar/2) = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) = hbar/(7).

Wait, because 4/14 is 2/7. So 2/7 multiplied by hbar/2 is hbar/7.

So, the average value is hbar/7.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

So, that's option A.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because there's another way to compute the expectation value: using the operator matrix.

Let me compute <A> as the expectation value of A in the state |alpha>.

The operator A is represented by the matrix:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

And the state |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So, in the computational basis (|up> and |down>), the state is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

To compute the expectation value <A>, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A, multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the state.

Alternatively, <A> = (1/7) [ (1+i) , (2 -i) ] * A * [ (1-i)^T, (2+i)^T ].

Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly.

Let me write the state as a column vector:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So in vector form, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The matrix A is:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]

Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

So, compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = [ (0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) , (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T

Simplify:

First component: (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (2hbar - i hbar) ]/(2 sqrt(7)).

Second component: (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) = [ hbar (1 + i) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

Now, to compute <A> = |alpha|^* A |alpha>:

Which is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A |alpha>.

So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2hbar - i hbar)/(2 sqrt(7)), (hbar (1 +i) )/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]^T

So, the product is:

= (1-i)/sqrt(7) * (2hbar -i hbar)/(2 sqrt(7)) + (2 +i)/sqrt(7) * (hbar (1 +i) )/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Factor out hbar/(2*7):

= hbar/(2*7) [ (1 -i)(2 - i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Now, compute each term inside the brackets:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2. Hmm, wait, let me compute it correctly.

(1)(2) =2

(1)(-i) = -i

(-i)(2) = -2i

(-i)(-i) = i^2 = -1

So, sum: 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-i -2i) = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i *1 +i *i.

= 2 + 2i + i + i^2.

= 2 +3i -1 = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

So, adding both terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i =2.

So, the expectation value is hbar/(2*7) * 2 = hbar/(7).

Which matches the earlier calculation. So, the expectation value is hbar/7.

So, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation is hbar/7, which is option A.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, that's correct.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the spin eigenstates along the \( x \)-axis, denoted as \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), which are given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle \right), \quad 
|-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle \right).
\]

The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \), the inner product is computed:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we find:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right).
\]

The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively. The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad 
P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

The average value of \( A \) is the expectation value \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using the eigenvalues of \( A \) (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)) and their respective probabilities, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).
