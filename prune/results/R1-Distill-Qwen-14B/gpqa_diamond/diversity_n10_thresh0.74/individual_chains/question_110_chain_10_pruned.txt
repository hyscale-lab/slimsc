Okay, so I've got this question about stars and spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The key here is to figure out each star's apparent magnitude because the question gives us the limiting magnitudes for each instrument.

Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. So, apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. And HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be seen by both, but for ESPRESSO, they can go a bit fainter up to 17. But wait, no—wait, no, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So stars brighter (lower magnitude) than 17.

Wait, let me clarify: if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 mag, that means it's magnitude is less than 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V ≤ 17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V ≤16 can be observed.

So a star needs to be bright enough to be seen by both. That means the star's apparent magnitude has to be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is, say, 15.5 mag, it's visible to both. If it's 16.5, then HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So only stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me read again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, brighter than 17 is V <17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16
