Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Michael addition problem. Hmm, let's see. Michael addition is a reaction between a nucleophile and an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new bond and creating an enolate intermediate.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a symmetric enolate. In the Michael reaction, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituents are important. The (E)-configuration means the substituents are opposite each other. So, the acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. Wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OR where the carbonyl is at position 1, then the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3. But wait, the (E) configuration refers to the double bond. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are the methyl group (from OCH3) and the p-tolyl.

Wait, no, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with the substituents on the double bond. Let me think: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group attached to the
