Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me see. I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime, right? So the given metric is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). 

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I think the metric given here might be representing such a space. But how do I find the area from this?

I remember that for surfaces, the area can be calculated using the metric tensor. The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor in matrix form. So I need to compute the determinant of the metric.

Looking at the metric, it's written in terms of dx² + dy² multiplied by a factor. So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4−x²−y²), g_yy is the same, and g_xy and g_yx are zero because there's no cross term. So the metric matrix is diagonal, which makes things easier.

The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant det(g) = (32/(4−x²−y²))². 

Wait, but area is an integral over the surface, right? So the total area A would be the integral of sqrt(det(g)) over x and y. But sqrt(det(g)) is sqrt[(32/(4−x²−y²))²] = 32/(4−x²−y²). 

So A = ∫∫ [32/(4−x²−y²)] dx dy. But what are the limits of integration? Because the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), the metric would blow up when 4−x²−y² approaches zero. So the region of integration is where 4−x²−y² > 0, which is the interior of a circle of radius 2, since x² + y² <4. So the limits are x from -2 to 2, and for each x, y from -sqrt(4−x²) to +sqrt(4−x²). But integrating in Cartesian coordinates might be complicated because of the circular symmetry. Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates?

Yes, switching to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So substituting, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this step by step. First, the integral over θ is straightforward. It's a constant factor of 2π. So A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Now, solving the integral ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * (-du/2) = -16 ∫ (1/u) du. Which is -16 ln|u| + C. 

But let's adjust the limits. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral from r=0 to 2 becomes the integral from u=4 to u=0. So:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 r/(u)] * (r dr = -du/2). Wait, wait. Let me correct that. When r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the substitution gives:

∫ [32 r/(u)] dr = 32 ∫ [r/(u)] dr. But r dr = -du/2, so:

32 ∫ [r/(u)] * (dr) = 32 * ∫ [r/(u) ] * (-du/(2r)) ) → because r dr = -du/2 → dr = (-du)/(2r). So substituting:

32 * ∫ [r/(u)] * (-du/(2r)) ) = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ [1/u] du. The r terms cancel out. So that's (-16) ∫ (1/u) du.

Now, the integral ∫ (1/u) du from u=4 to u=0 is ln|u| evaluated from 4 to 0, which is ln(0) - ln(4). Wait, wait
