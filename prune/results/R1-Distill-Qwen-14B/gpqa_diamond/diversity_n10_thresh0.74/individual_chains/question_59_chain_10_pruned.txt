Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. The volumes and concentrations are given for each. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, since Ba is a group 2 metal and OH- is strong).

Hmm, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the first thing to do is find out if there's an acid or base in excess. So, I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see what's left after they neutralize each other.

Wait, but wait! Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

So first, let me calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl is next. Volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 liters. 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is strong, it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: Volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 liters. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Wait, but each Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- ions, right? So moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to find the net moles of H+ and OH- after mixing.

But wait, in the mixture, H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) will react with OH- (from Ba(OH)2) to form water. The excess of either H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So let's add up all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. It doesn't completely dissociate. So I can't just add its moles directly to H+ from HCl. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Because the H+ from acetic acid is going to be much less than the moles of the acid itself. So maybe I can't ignore it, but perhaps I should see if the strong acid and base neutralize each other before considering the weak acid.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the net acid or base after all the neutralization.

First, let me consider the strong acid and strong base reaction. The H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

Which one is in excess? Let's see: OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08. So OH- will have some left after neutralizing the H+.

Neutralization: 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

But wait, what about the acetic acid's H+? Because acetic acid is a weak acid, it does contribute some H+
