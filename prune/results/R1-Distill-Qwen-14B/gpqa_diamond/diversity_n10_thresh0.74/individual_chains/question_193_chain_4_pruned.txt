Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, I think I need to relate parallax to distance and then find how N depends on distance.

Wait, right, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, and since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So substituting plx with 1/d, the equation becomes N ∝ (d)^5. Because (1/(1/d))^5 is d^5. Wait, wait no. Let me calculate that again.

Wait, 1/plx^5 is the same as (1/(plx))^5. Since plx is 1/d, 1/(plx) is d. So (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you look further, the number of stars you can see per unit volume increases, but maybe I'm mixing up concepts.

Wait no, wait, let's think about it. The number of stars observed in a region. So if you have a higher distance, you're looking into more volume? Wait, but the way the question is phrased, N varies with parallax. So how does the number of stars per unit distance change?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r. So the number of stars in a thin shell might be proportional to the volume (since more volume can contain more stars), but the actual number density might affect it. But let's get back to the math.

So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And plx is 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean that as distance increases, the number of
