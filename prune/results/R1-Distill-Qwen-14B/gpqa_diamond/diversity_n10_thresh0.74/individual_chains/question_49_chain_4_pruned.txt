Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with sigmatropic rearrangements. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. The options give possible products, and I have to choose the correct set. Let's take each part one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. Hmm, I remember that when you have an amine and an alcohol reacting with acid and heat, it might form an imine or something similar. Wait, but there's also a methoxy group. Oh, maybe it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? Wait, but the Claisen rearrangement typically involves an allyl vinyl ether. Let me think.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's like ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. When this reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is an allylic alcohol. Oh, wait, I think the reaction could be a Huisgen cycloaddition? No, that's for azides and alkynes. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a hemiacetal or something else. Or perhaps a Mannich reaction? Not sure.

Another angle: under acidic conditions, the amine might protonate. The but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Maybe they undergo some kind of condensation. Wait, but the presence of two methoxy groups suggests that perhaps it's a rearrangement. Oh! Maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but with an amine involved.

Wait, Claisen rearrangement is when an allyl vinyl ether rearranges to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is an amine. Oh, perhaps this is a similar rearrangement but involving an amine. So, maybe it's a type of sigmatropic shift where a sigma bond moves along with a pi bond. So the amine has two methoxy groups; perhaps the ethan-1-amine is part of a structure that can undergo such a shift.

Wait, let's draw the structures. 1,1-dimeth
