Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is Lithium. Lithium usually has 3 protons and variable neutrons. So, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait. Li normally has an atomic number of 3, so if it's Li-6, that's the isotope with 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6. So the mass of the nucleus would be approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. But wait, the exact mass might need the atomic mass. Wait, but perhaps we can approximate the mass using the molar mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 amu. But wait, wait, no. Because in reality, the atomic mass includes electrons too. Oh wait, but when we're talking about the nucleus, it's just the protons and neutrons. So maybe we can just take the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton? Because a neutron is slightly heavier than a proton, but maybe for approximation, we can consider that. Or perhaps the problem expects us to just use the mass number A as 6, so the mass m = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

Wait, but to find the kinetic energy, I think I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Because in particle physics, often the kinetic energy is calculated relativistically, and the total energy is gamma times the rest energy. So, the energy of the particle in the collider would be the total energy, which is gamma mc².

So, first, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So
