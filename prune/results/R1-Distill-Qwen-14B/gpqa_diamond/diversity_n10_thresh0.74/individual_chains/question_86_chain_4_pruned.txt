Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products from both reactions are given. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The question is asking which starting materials (A and B) were used for each reaction, given four options.

So, the two reactions are:

1. A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
2. B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in more polar solvents, and BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used in less polar solvents. Wait, no, I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3·THF (which is a common source of BH3). Oh right, LiBH4 is more reactive and can reduce things that BH3 might not. But wait, in the context of ketones, LiBH4 might not do much because ketones are generally not reduced under normal conditions by LiBH4. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: wait, LiBH4 is used for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols, but in the presence of a certain structure. Alternatively, maybe in this case, we're dealing with cyclic ketones or something else.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, right? So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, no. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, one double bond (since it's 2H, meaning the double bond is between C1 and C2?), and a ketone at position 2. So it's a
