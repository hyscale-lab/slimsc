Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r squared. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇ · f, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are A through D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but let's think. So, the field is radial and its magnitude is 1/r². I remember that the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that depends only on r is given by a specific formula. Oh right, for a vector field F(r) with only a radial component, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r). 

So here, F_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So let's plug that in. The divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) because F_r is 1/r².

Wait, let's compute that. r squared times 1/r squared is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh, so the divergence is zero? That would mean that the integral of the divergence over the volume is zero.

But wait, isn't that similar to the electric field of a point charge? Oh right, the electric field of a point charge has a divergence proportional to the charge density. For Gauss's law, the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0. But in this case, our field is 1/r², just like E for a point charge, which suggests that the divergence is zero except at the origin. Wait, but wait, the divergence we calculated was zero everywhere except r=0. So the volume integral would be zero, right?

Hmm, but wait, isn't there a Dirac delta function involved when the field is like that? Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, and the integral over all space would be the charge enclosed, but in this problem, we're integrating within a sphere of radius R. If R is not approaching zero, then the origin is included in the sphere. So in that
