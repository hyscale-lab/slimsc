Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable (like P_z) is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, I think that's the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is |ψ⟩.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the matrix representations of P_x, P_y, P_z are given in this basis. That means if I have a state expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, applying these matrices is straightforward.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† P_z² ψ.

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. It's given as:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

Wait, so in matrix form, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. The off-diagonal are zero. That makes sense because P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis.

Now, the state |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2,
           1/√2,
          -1/2 ]^T

So, I can compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be easy. Let me write it out.

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = (-1/2)* (ħ*(-1/2)) ) + (1/√2)* (0*(1/√2)) ) + (-1/2)* ( (-ħ)*(-1/2) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of it as
