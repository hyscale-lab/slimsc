Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let's see what each option is.

The question is asking which of these theories doesn't need regularization when dealing with high energies. Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you remove it later when you renormalize.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory, right? Strings are these tiny vibrating objects that make up particles. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, and it's a candidate for a theory that unifies all forces. Now, because it incorporates gravity, it might avoid some of the issues that other quantum field theories have at high energies. Wait, but wait—don't I remember something about string theory requiring some form of regularization or maybe it doesn't? Or maybe it's about being a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as, say, QCD or QED because it's a different framework. Or perhaps because strings are extended objects, they don't have the same issues with point particles leading to singularities. Hmm, not sure. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Quantum Yang-Mills. But it's also asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But wait, does that mean it doesn't require regularization? I thought that even asymptotically free theories can have divergences in loop calculations. So you would still need to regularize and renormalize. So QCD probably needs regularization. So option B is likely not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, electrons, and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory. But in the early days, people like Dirac ran into problems with infinities in calculations of things like the electron self-energy. So they had to use regularization techniques to handle these infinities before renormalizing. So QED definitely requires regularization. So option C is not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version of electromagnetism. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same quantum divergences. In classical E&M, you can have things like point charges leading to infinite fields at the origin, but that's more of a mathematical issue rather than a physical divergence. Wait, but the question is about high energies. Wait, how does that tie in? Oh, wait—classical theories don't have the same kind of quantum divergences because they don't involve quantum fluctuations or the same kind of loop diagrams. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with the same infinities that come up in quantum theories. So that would mean option D is the answer.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization at high energies
