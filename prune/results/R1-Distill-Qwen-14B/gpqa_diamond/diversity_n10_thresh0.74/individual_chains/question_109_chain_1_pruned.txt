Okay, so I've got this problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question says there's a bound system of two nucleons (NN) initially in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics come into play, and there's this equation: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN)=0, and I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed.

Wait, let me recap what I know. The 1S0 state is an example of a term symbol. The general form is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1 =1 implies S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is S which usually represents the s orbital, so L=0. And J is 0, so it's a singlet state with no angular momentum.

So the initial state (before emission) is 1S0. Then, the NN system emits a particle X. So the final state of NN will have different quantum numbers, and X will have its own.

The problem mentions that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is total spin, L is orbital angular momentum. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because for Pauli's exclusion principle, when dealing with identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But this question is about the combination of isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum. Oh right, the overall wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric based on the statistics.

Wait, the equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin quantum number, S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum. Since these are quantum numbers, adding them as mod 2 would be considering their parity—whether they are even or odd integers.

The initial state is 1S0. So before emission, the NN system has S=0, L=0, and T I'm not sure about. But after emitting X, the final state has T=0.

Wait, but the equation says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So for the final state, T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L ≡ -1 mod 2, which is same as S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. Because -1 is congruent to 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be 1 mod 2. Which means S and L can't be both even or both odd. Because if both are even, their sum is even. If both are
