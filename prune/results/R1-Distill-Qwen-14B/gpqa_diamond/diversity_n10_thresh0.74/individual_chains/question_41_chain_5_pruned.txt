Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium, the speed of light in that medium is usually c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the glass is moving, so I think I need to consider relativistic effects here. Oh right, because if the medium is moving relative to the observer, the speed of light as measured by the observer isn't simply c/n anymore. Relativity of velocity comes into play here.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the light beam. So the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer, and the beam is also moving in that direction. So the beam's speed in the glass would be c/n, but then we have to adjust for the movement of the glass itself.

Oh, right, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Alternatively, since the problem states that c is taken as 1, maybe I should set c=1 to simplify the calculations.

Wait a second, wait. Let me think about the setup again. The light beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the speed of the light relative to the glass is v_light = c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass. But wait, that's for non-relativistic speeds. However, since we're dealing with light and possibly relativistic speeds, the relativistic addition formula is needed.

Wait, but wait. In the glass, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, the lab frame would perceive the light's speed as the sum of the two velocities, but adjusted for relativity. So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), but since c=1, it becomes (u + v) / (1 + u v).

Wait, but wait, the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then in the lab frame, the light's speed would be higher than c/n? But wait, c=1, so the speed of light can't exceed 1 in any inertial frame. Hmm, that makes sense because relativistic effects would prevent that.

So, let's break it down. The speed of light in the glass is u = c/n = 1/n. Because when the medium is stationary, light speed in it is 1/n. Now, the glass is moving with speed v in the same direction as the light. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light would be u' = (u
