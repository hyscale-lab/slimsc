Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my X-ray diffraction, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, that's a pretty sharp angle. 

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. I think interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms along the edges of the unit cell. So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstrom here. Right, because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are of equal length 'a'.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula for the interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by 1/d² equals (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by (1/(1 - cos² α)), but wait, I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula for different crystal systems.

Wait, no. For a general rhombohedral system, the formula for d(hkl) is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk + 2hl + 2kl) cos α ) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ). Since all angles are 30 degrees here, that would be the value of cos α to use.

Wait, another approach: For a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But since this isn't cubic, we need a more general formula.

Let me get that formula right. The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d² = a² [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk
