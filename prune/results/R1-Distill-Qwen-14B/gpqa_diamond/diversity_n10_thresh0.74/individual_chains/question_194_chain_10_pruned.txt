Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. I'm a bit rusty on my statistical mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, but each spin can be +1 or -1, so each S_i has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression. E is proportional to the sum of the products of adjacent spins. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, because S_i and S_j are each +1 or -1.

Wait, S_i S_j is +1 if they are the same, and -1 if opposite. So each S_i S_j term is ±1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary based on how the spins are arranged.

Hmm. Let me consider different cases based on how many pairs are aligned. Or perhaps, for each state, compute the sum of the three terms.

Wait, let's think about all possible states. Since each spin is either +1 or -1, each state can be represented as a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Let's list them all:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these
