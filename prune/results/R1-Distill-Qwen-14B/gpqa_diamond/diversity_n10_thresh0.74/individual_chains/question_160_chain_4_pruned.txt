Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. It creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, they mention that we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Hmm. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark fringes. This is diffraction. The simplest case is a single slit, but here it's a polygon with many sides when N is large.

Wait, when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circular aperture. But wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal—so what's an apothem? Oh, right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side; it's the radius of the inscribed circle.

So for a regular N-gon, the apothem 'a' is the same for all sides. So as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius 'a'. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex) as r = a / cos(π/N). But as N becomes very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so r ≈ a. So the shape becomes a circle of radius a.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the apothem is 'a' and it's a regular polygon, then the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is a / cos(π/N). So for very large N, it's approximately a. So the aperture's shape approaches a circle with radius a when N is very large.

So, in the limit as N approaches infinity, the problem reduces to a circular aperture.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, for a single slit, the minima are given by a sin
