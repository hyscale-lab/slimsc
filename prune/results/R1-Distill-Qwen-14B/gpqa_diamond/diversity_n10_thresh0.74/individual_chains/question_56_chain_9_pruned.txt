Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons. These transitions follow certain selection rules. The selection rules are important because they dictate which transitions are allowed or forbidden.

The standard selection rules for dipole transitions (which are electric dipole transitions) are:
- Δn = ±1, ±2, ... (so n can increase or decrease by 1, 2, etc.)
- Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)

Wait, but for hydrogen, I think there's another consideration. Oh right, the orbitals must have opposite parity for the transition to be allowed. Parity is determined by (-1)^l. So when the initial state has l_i and the final has l_f, the product of their parities must be negative (since the photon has parity -1). That means l_i + l_f must be odd. So, l_i and l_f must differ by 1 because Δl is ±1, but wait, let's think again.

Wait, the parity of the initial and final states must be opposite. So, if the initial state has l = 0 (like |3,0,0⟩), then the final state must have l = 1 because (0 + 1) is odd. Because parity of initial is (-1)^0 = 1, parity of final is (-1)^1 = -1. Their product is -1, which matches the photon's parity.

So, the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1. So, after the first dipole transition, the electron must be in an l=1 state. Then, the second transition must bring it down to l=0 (since the final state is |1,0,0⟩), so the second transition must change l from 1 to 0. That makes sense.

Now, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition (Δl=±1) would take it to an l=1 state. So possible states are |n',1,m'⟩ where n' can be 2 or 4, but wait, the energy levels are such that higher n have higher energy. So, from n=3, you can go to n=2 or n=4. But wait, in this case, the decay is to |1,0,0⟩, so after two steps. So, the first step would go from 3,0,0 to either 2,1, something or 4,1, something. But wait, the second transition would have to bring it down to n=1. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the first transition is 3→2, then 2→1.

So, first transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩. Then, the next transition would be from |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but wait: in the selection rules, when going from l=1 to l=0, that's a Δl of -1, which is allowed. So that's okay.

So the first transition must go to a state with l=1, n can be 2 or 4. Let's think about the possible n's.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0.

First transition (dipole): Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc. So possible n after first transition could be 2 (3-1), 4 (3+1), 1 (3-2), or 5 (3+2). But wait, for a single dipole transition, I think the maximum Δn
