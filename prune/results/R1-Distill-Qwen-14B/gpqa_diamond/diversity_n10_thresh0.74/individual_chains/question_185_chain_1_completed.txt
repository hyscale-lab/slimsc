Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, σ is a vector of the three Pauli matrices: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be the dot product of these matrices with a unit vector n. 

Wait, what's the Pauli spin matrix? Each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh wait, no, actually the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by some factor, the eigenvalues change accordingly.

So the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because it's the dot product of σ with a unit vector. Let me think more about the structure of H. The dot product would be σ_x * n_x + σ_y * n_y + σ_z * n_z. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

Since σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of the unit vector, it's like a spin component along an arbitrary direction. But what's the eigenvalue of such an operator?

Wait, each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues ±1. So when we have a linear combination like a σ_x + b σ_y + c σ_z (where a² + b² + c² =1 because n is a unit vector), the eigenvalues of this matrix would be ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the vector. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

The general expression for the eigenvalues of σ · n. Let me think in terms of eigenvalues. The operator σ · n is a traceless Hermitian matrix. The trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero. 

In general, for a matrix like (n · σ), the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Because the Pauli matrices satisfy (σ · n)^2 = I, the identity matrix, because (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + ... )². Expanding that, each σ_i squares to I, and the cross terms (like σ_i σ_j for i ≠ j) are anti-commuting, but when n is a unit vector, the cross terms sum up to zero because the sum of n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i) would be proportional to the identity. Wait, maybe I should compute (σ · n)^2.

Let me compute (σ · n)^2. So (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Each σ_i^2 is I, so the square of each term gives n_x² I, etc. Then cross terms: 2 n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + similar terms. But σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So when you compute (σ · n)^2, the cross terms will involve terms like 2 n_x n_y (i σ_z + (-i σ_z )) ? Wait no, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Let's expand this.

Each term in the product is n_x σ_x times each term. So:

n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_x σ_y σ_x + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z + n_z n_x σ_z σ_x + n_z n_y σ_z σ_y.

Now, σ_x² = σ_y² = σ_z² = I. So the first three terms are (n_x² + n_y² + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + ... =1. So that gives I.

Now the cross terms: Let's group them. For example, σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So, for the terms n_x n_y σ_x σ_y and n_x n_y σ_y σ_x, the sum would be n_x n_y (i σ_z - i σ_z ) = 0. Similarly, all the cross terms would cancel out because they come in pairs like σ_i σ_j and σ_j σ_i, which are negatives of each other when i≠j. Wait, no, actually, the cross terms are 2 n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x)/2? Hmm, perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: σ · n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with n, a unit vector. The square of this is (σ · n)^2 = (n · σ)(n · σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. So, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So the sum becomes n_i n_j (I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k ) = n_i^2 I + i n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

But since n is a unit vector, n_i^2 =1 only when i is the direction of n. Wait, no, n is a unit vector, so n_i n_i = 1, but n_i n_j for i≠j is not necessarily zero unless n is along one of the axes. So perhaps another approach: the square is (σ · n)^2 = (n · σ)(n · σ) = n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. But σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So:

n_i n_j (I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k ) = I (n_i n_i) + i n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

But n_i n_i is just 1 (since n is unit), so the first term is I.

The second term is i n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k. Hmm, but for each term ε_ijk is antisymmetric (so ε_ijk = -ε_jik), and when i and j are swapped, the term changes sign. So the sum over i and j would result in terms that cancel out?

Wait, perhaps a different approach: the square of (σ · n) is (σ · n)^2 = I (n · n) + i (σ · (n × n)) ). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. Another approach: Since σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, and n is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of σ · n are known. 

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1 because the spin matrices have eigenvalues ±1, and their components are scaled by the unit vector. So, for the operator σ · n, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. 

Wait, but in the Hamiltonian, we have H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues will be ε multiplied by each of the eigenvalues of σ · n. So the eigenvalues of H are ε*1 and ε*(-1), which is ±ε.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, but when you have σ · n, where n is a unit vector, would the eigenvalues change?

No, because σ · n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. But each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues don't just add up because they don't commute.

Wait, but wait, σ · n is a Hermitian operator because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real. So, the eigenvalues will be real. The trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ. The trace is λ + (-λ) =0, which fits.

What's the magnitude? The square of σ · n is (σ · n)^2. Let me compute that. (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. As I thought earlier, this would be equal to I because the cross terms cancel out. Wait, because (σ · n)^2 = I?

Wait, yes. Because (σ · n)^2 = (n · σ)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i)/2 *2. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. Because for i=j, σ_i^2=I. For i≠j, σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 0? No, wait, actually, σ_i and σ_j anticommute when i≠j, because σ_i σ_j = -σ_j σ_i. So σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i =0 when i≠j.

So, (σ · n)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + ... + 2 n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + ... 

Which becomes n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + 2 n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x)/2 + ... 

Wait, no, because when i≠j, the cross terms are 2 n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. But since σ_i σ_j = -σ_j σ_i, so when we have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 0.

Wait, that would make all cross terms zero. So (σ · n)^2 = (n_x² + n_y² +n_z²) I = I, since n is a unit vector. 

So, (σ · n)^2 = I. Taking square roots, σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because if M^2 = I, then M can have eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of (σ · n) are ±1.

So, the eigenvalues of H = ε (σ · n) would be ε *1 and ε * (-1), so ±ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B says "+ε, -ε", which matches this. 

Wait, but wait another possibility: sometimes in physics, the Pauli matrices are scaled by ħ/2. Does that come into play here? Because sometimes I've seen σ as proportional to σ^i multiplied by ħ/2. For example, the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ.

Oh wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So if σ is the Pauli matrices, then the eigenvalues would be ± ε. Because σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. But if σ were replaced by (σ · n) scaled by ħ/2, then the eigenvalues would be ± ε ħ/2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the Hamiltonian is written as H = ε σ · n. So if σ is the Pauli matrices as defined (without the ½ factor), then the eigenvalues are ± ε. 

So the eigenvalues are ±ε, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in some conventions, the spin matrices are S = (ħ/2) σ. So if the Hamiltonian were written using S, then H would be ε * 2 S · n, or something like that. But in this case, H is using σ directly, so the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with energy dimension, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \(H\).

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are known to be \(\pm 1\) because \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix, and the eigenvalues of a matrix satisfying \(M^2 = I\) are \(\pm 1\).

Since the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are simply \(\varepsilon\) multiplied by these values, giving eigenvalues of \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (+1, -1):** Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- **Option B (+\(\varepsilon\), -\(\varepsilon\)):** Correct, as shown above.
- **Option C (+\(\varepsilon \hbar/2\), -\(\varepsilon \hbar/2\)):** Incorrect, as the Hamiltonian does not include the \(\hbar/2\) factor.
- **Option D (+\(\hbar/2\), -\(\hbar/2\)):** Incorrect, as it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\), corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B
