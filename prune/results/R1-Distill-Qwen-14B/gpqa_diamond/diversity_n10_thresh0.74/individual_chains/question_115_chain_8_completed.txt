Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question involves an electron and a positron moving towards each other, colliding, and then annihilating into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, right. Let me start by recalling what I know about annihilation and photon emission. So, when a particle and its antiparticle (like electron and positron) annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, typically producing photons. In this case, two photons are produced.

Wait, but I think the annihilation must conserve both energy and momentum. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta must be considered. But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, so their rest masses are the same. But their Lorentz factors are different: the electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is equal to E/(m*c²), so the electron's energy is 4*m*c² and the positron's is 2*m*c². But wait, the positron's momentum would be gamma*m*v, but since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So the total initial momentum is the sum of the two momenta.

Let me calculate their momenta. Oh wait, the momentum of a relativistic particle is gamma*m*v. But v can be expressed as beta*c, where beta is v/c. So gamma is given, but I might need beta for each particle.

But maybe it's easier to calculate their relativistic momenta using p = gamma*m*v, but perhaps I can express it in terms of gamma and the rest mass. Alternatively, maybe I can find the total energy and momentum of the system before annihilation.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so let's say its velocity is to the right (positive direction), and the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. So p_e is positive, p_p is negative? Or maybe I should just consider their directions when calculating the total momentum.

Wait, but since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum is p_e (electron's) minus p_p (positron's, since it's moving opposite). Or wait, the positron's direction is opposite, so its momentum is negative if the electron's is positive.

But wait, I need to compute the total momentum before annihilation. Let me think: the electron is moving to the right (let's say positive direction), and the positron is moving to the left (negative direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Each of their momenta is given by p = gamma * m * v. But I think it's easier to express in terms of beta and gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), and beta = v/c.

So for each particle, p = gamma * m * beta * c. Because v = beta c.

Wait, but the rest mass is m, so for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c. Similarly for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m_p * beta_p * c. But since the positron has the same mass as the electron, m_e = m_p = m.

So, for the electron, gamma_e is 4. Let's compute beta_e.

Gamma_e = 4, so gamma_e² = 16. But gamma_e^2 = 1/(1 - beta_e^2), so 1/(1 - beta_e^2) = 16 → 1 - beta_e^2 = 1/16 → beta_e^2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Wait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, so 3.872/4 ≈ 0.968.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p = 2. Let's find beta_p.

Gamma_p = 2 → gamma_p² =4 = 1/(1 - beta_p^2) → 1 - beta_p^2 = 1/4 → beta_p^2 = 3/4 → beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c.

So, electron's momentum p_e = gamma_e * m * beta_e * c = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) * c.

Wait, wait: wait, p = gamma * m * beta * c. So let me plug in:

p_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m * sqrt(15) * c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p * m * beta_p * c = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m * sqrt(3) * c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is in the negative direction. So the total initial momentum is p_e (positive) minus p_p (since it's moving opposite).

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the electron is moving to the right with p_e positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative direction, so its momentum is -p_p.

So total initial momentum P_initial = p_e + (-p_p) = (m sqrt(15) c) - (m sqrt(3) c) ) = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Hmm, but wait, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so the total momentum is (p_e) - (p_p) ?

Wait, let me think again. The electron's momentum is to the right, so positive. The positron's momentum is to the left, so it's negative. So the total momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Yes, correct.

So, P_initial = p_e - p_p = [4 m (sqrt(15)/4) c ] - [ 2 m (sqrt(3)/2) c ] = [ m sqrt(15) c ] - [ m sqrt(3) c ] = m c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Wait, let me compute that numerically to see. sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14. So P_initial ≈ 2.14 m c.

But the total energy is the sum of the two energies. The electron's energy is gamma_e m c² = 4 m c². The positron's is gamma_p m c² = 2 m c². So total energy E_initial = 6 m c².

After annihilation, two photons are produced, each with energy E_photon = (6 m c²)/2 = 3 m c².

Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy is (6 m c²)/2 = 3 m c². So yes, the energies are equal, as given.

Now, since photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/c, but considering their direction. Since both photons have the same energy, their momenta will have magnitudes E_photon / c = (3 m c²)/c = 3 m c.

But their directions are both in the upper-right and lower-right. So each photon is moving at an angle from the horizontal, one above and one below.

Wait, but the initial system has some momentum, so the photons must carry away momentum in such a way that the total momentum after equals the initial.

Wait, but the initial momentum is P_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ 2.14 m c in the positive x-direction.

So the sum of the photons' momenta must equal this initial momentum. Let's denote the two photons' momenta as vectors.

Each photon has energy E_photon = 3 m c². So their magnitudes of momentum are p1 = E1/c = 3 m c, and p2 = 3 m c.

Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis. Since one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 makes an angle theta below, but perhaps a different angle? Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and another is lower-right; it's not clear if the angles are the same. No, the problem states that both photons have the same energy, but it doesn't say the angles are the same.

Wait, but the problem says that the energies are same, but directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So each has direction in those quadrants.

Hmm, perhaps the angles are symmetric, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the two photons have symmetric angles but in opposite directions. Let me think about how to model this.

The total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. The initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the total momentum after must also be along the x-axis. That implies that the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero, and the sum of the x-components must equal the initial P_initial.

Let me denote the angles of the photons as theta1 and theta2. Photon 1 is in the upper-right (so theta1 is above the x-axis), and photon 2 is in the lower-right (so theta2 is below the x-axis). But wait, if both are in the lower-right, then it's possible that their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Or perhaps not.

Wait, but for their y-components to cancel, the sum of their y-components must be zero. So p1y + p2y = 0.

Assuming that, we can write:

p1y = p1 * sin(theta1) = 3 m c sin(theta1)
p2y = p2 * sin(theta2) = 3 m c sin(theta2)

Since p1y + p2y =0 → 3 m c (sin(theta1) + sin(theta2)) )=0 → sin(theta1) + sin(theta2)=0.

Which implies that sin(theta2) = - sin(theta1). So theta2 = - theta1, or theta2 = 180 - theta1 (but that might not make sense in this context because the angles are in the lower-right).

Wait, but theta2 being in the lower-right would mean that sin(theta2) is negative. So theta1 is positive (say, above x-axis), and theta2 is negative (below x-axis), but their magnitudes might differ.

But wait, perhaps another approach: since the sum of the y-components must be zero, the angles might be symmetric about the x-axis. So if one photon is at angle theta above x-axis, the other would be at -theta, so their sines are negatives, and the y-components cancel.

But wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right, which suggests that both are in the right half-plane (positive x-direction), but one is above x-axis and the other is below.

So let me model this with the two photons having angles theta and -theta. But wait, if theta is the angle above, then the other would be theta below. But that's not possible because the direction would be symmetric. But let me proceed.

Wait, let me think again: if both photons are moving in the right direction, then their momenta have positive x-components. So their x-components add up, and their y-components must cancel because the initial system has no y-momentum.

So, considering that:

p1x = p1 * cos(theta1)
p2x = p2 * cos(theta2)
p1y = p1 * sin(theta1)
p2y = p2 * sin(theta2)

The sum of the y-components must be zero: p1y + p2y = 0 → 3 m c ( sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) ) = 0 → sin(theta1) + sin(theta2)=0.

So sin(theta2) = - sin(theta1).

Now, considering that both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So cos(theta1) and cos(theta2) must be positive, which implies that theta1 and theta2 are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.

So, if theta1 is positive (upper right), then theta2 is negative (lower right), and the condition is sin(theta2) = - sin(theta1), which is equivalent to sin(theta2) = sin(-theta1) → theta2 = - theta1.

So, theta2 = - theta1.

But wait, in that case, the sum of the y-components would be zero, and the x-components would add up.

So, the x-components are both positive, so the sum would be p1x + p2x = p1 cos(theta1) + p2 cos(theta2).

But since p1=p2=3 m c, and theta2 = - theta1, cos(theta2)=cos(-theta1)=cos(theta1).

So sum of x-components is 3 m c cos(theta1) + 3 m c cos(theta1) = 6 m c cos(theta1).

But this must equal the initial momentum along x: P_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So:

6 m c cos(theta1) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Dividing both sides by m c:

6 cos(theta1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos(theta1) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6.

Hmm, let's compute that value numerically.

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298,
sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos(theta1) ≈ 0.35682.

So theta1 ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ about 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait, arccos(0.35682) would be around 69 degrees. Because cos(60) is 0.5, so 0.356 is a bit lower than that. Let me calculate more precisely.

Using a calculator, cos(69°) is approximately 0.3584, which is close to 0.3568. So theta1 is approximately 69 degrees.

Wait, wait, but wait, if theta1 is 69 degrees above the x-axis, then theta2 is 69 degrees below the x-axis. Then each photon is at an angle of +/- 69 degrees relative to the x-axis.

But the question asks for the angle between the two photons' directions. So the angle between them is theta1 - theta2. But since theta2 is negative, it's 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees.

Wait, that would mean the angle between them is 138 degrees. Let's see if that matches one of the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which would match.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

So, P_initial = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The sum of the x-components of the photons is 6 m c cos(theta1), which equals P_initial.

So:

6 cos(theta1) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

cos(theta1) ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

Arccos(0.35682) is approximately 69 degrees. So theta1 is 69 degrees, theta2 is -69 degrees.

The angle between them is 69 - (-69) = 138 degrees.

So the answer would be option C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, which produce two photons of equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the two photons.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - Both particles annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy.

2. **Conservation Laws**:
   - **Energy Conservation**: The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Since the Lorentz factor of the electron is 4 and the positron is 2, their energies are \( E_{\text{electron}} = 4m c^2 \) and \( E_{\text{positron}} = 2m c^2 \). Thus, the total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} = 6m c^2 \). After annihilation, this energy is equally divided between the two photons, so each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3m c^2 \).

   - **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum of the system before annihilation must equal the total momentum after annihilation. The electron and positron have opposite momenta due to their opposite directions. The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by \( p = \gamma m v \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor and \( v = \beta c \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), the momenta are calculated as:
     - Electron: \( p_{\text{electron}} = 4m c^2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m c \sqrt{15} \).
     - Positron: \( p_{\text{positron}} = 2m c^2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m c \sqrt{3} \).
     - Total momentum: \( P_{\text{initial}} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \).

3. **Photon Momentum and Directions**:
   - Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3m c^2 \), so their magnitudes of momentum are \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3m c \).
   - The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) with respect to the x-axis. The y-components of their momenta must cancel to conserve momentum in the y-direction:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_1) + \sin(\theta_2) = 0 \implies \sin(\theta_2) = -\sin(\theta_1).
     \]
     This implies \( \theta_2 = -\theta_1 \), meaning the photons are symmetric about the x-axis.

4. **X-Component of Momentum**:
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta must sum to the total initial momentum:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon},x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos(\theta_1) = 3m c \cos(\theta_1).
     \]
     Since there are two photons, the total x-momentum is:
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = 2 \cdot 3m c \cos(\theta_1) = 6m c \cos(\theta_1).
     \]
     Equating this to the initial momentum:
     \[
     6m c \cos(\theta_1) = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
     \]
     we find:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]

5. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Substituting \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we compute:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{3.872 - 1.732}{6} \approx 0.3568.
     \]
     Thus, \( \theta_1 \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ \). Since \( \theta_2 = -\theta_1 \), the angle between the two photons is:
     \[
     \theta_1 - \theta_2 = 69^\circ - (-69^\circ) = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
