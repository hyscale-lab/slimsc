Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and chromatography concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Let me read them carefully.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each.

Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure of this compound would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5. The configuration is S, so the methoxy is on the correct side for that configuration.

LAH, which is lithium aluminum hydride, is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So when it reacts with a ketone, it should reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Wait, but waitâ€”LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to also reduce esters, amides, etc., but here we're dealing with a ketone, so that's straightforward.

So the ketone (hexan-3-one) becomes a secondary alcohol. Let me draw that out. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the ketone (C3) becomes an alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me count. Hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me structure it correctly. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Hexane has six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on C-3. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me write it as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's 3-pentanone. Wait, hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexane has six carbons. So, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH3CH2-C(O)-
