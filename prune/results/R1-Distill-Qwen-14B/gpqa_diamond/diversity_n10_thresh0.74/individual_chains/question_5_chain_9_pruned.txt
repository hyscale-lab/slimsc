Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, when you have an operator for a direction that's not aligned with the standard axes, you need to express it as a combination of the Pauli matrices. Or maybe I should construct the operator P along direction n first.

The direction n is in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So θ is the angle between the direction n and the z-axis.

The operator P along direction n would be given by P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). But wait, no, that's not quite right. The operator for the component along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), right? 

But wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is an operator. So the operator P along n is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. So I need to compute this operator and then find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The given components are P_x, P_y, P_z, each multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So the matrix is:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is:
[ [0, -(iħ/2)],
  [iħ/2, 0] ]

P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So the matrix is:
[ [ħ/2, 0],
  [0, -ħ/2
