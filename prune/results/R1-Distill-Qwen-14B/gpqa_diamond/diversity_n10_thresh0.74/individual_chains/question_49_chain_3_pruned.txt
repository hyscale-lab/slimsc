Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements have always been a bit tricky for me. But let's take a deep breath and break it down step by step. 

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each part is a different sigmatropic rearrangement, and I need to figure out what each product looks like from the given starting materials. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different structures for A, B, and C. 

Let me start with reaction A. The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Hmm, I remember that Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of sigmatropic shifts. Wait, but those usually involve 1,5-dienes. Oh wait, but the starting material here is something else. Let me think. 

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine structure: it's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's structured as NH2-C(OCH3)2. Oh, wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the first carbon. So the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2. Wait, but that's not possible because ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, that would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So the structure would be OCH3-OCH3 attached to the same carbon as the amine. So, the molecule would be (OCH3)2CHNH2. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (NH2)CH2-OCH3 and another OCH3 on the same carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it as (CH2NH2)(OCH3)2? Wait
