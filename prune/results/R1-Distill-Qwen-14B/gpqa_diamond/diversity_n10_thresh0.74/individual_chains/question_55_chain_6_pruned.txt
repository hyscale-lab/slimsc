Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

Let me start by recalling what each of these compounds looks like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid. So, propenyl acetate would have a propenyl group (which is an allyl group, CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond) attached to an acetic acid-derived ester. Similarly, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon allyl group.

The structures for each option:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propenyl group, and the substituents on either side are on the same side (cis). So, the structure is CH2CH2OAc, with the double bond in the middle. Wait, actually, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc for propenyl, but wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait. No, wait, propenyl is -CH2CH=CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So, the ester is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? Or is it CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond somewhere. Hmm, perhaps I should draw them.

Wait, let's think about the structure of each compound:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The substituents on the double bond (the CH2OAc and the CH2) are on the same side. So, the structure would be CH2=C(OAc)CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, no. Acetate is OAc- as the leaving group. So, the acetate ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct: The structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2.
