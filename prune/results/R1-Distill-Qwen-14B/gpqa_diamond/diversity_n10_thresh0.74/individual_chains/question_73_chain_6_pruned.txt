Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for relativistic velocity addition. Oh right, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). Wait, but wait—I think I might have that mixed up. Let me think: if one object is moving at v and the other at u (from a different frame), the relative speed in the same direction would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Or is it (u - v)/(1 - (v u)/(c²))? Or maybe it's (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²))?

Wait, wait, I think it's (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds divided by that denominator. So, let me plug in the numbers.

The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, let's call it v. The second is 0.5c, u. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Which one is moving faster? Oh, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, which is faster than 0.5c. So the second is slower. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ), right?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: because in the problem, both are moving in the same direction. So, the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first's frame would be (u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²)). Wait, wait, let me think again
