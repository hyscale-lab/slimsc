Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. That means you can have a magnet with just a single pole, like a lone north or a lone south, not necessarily needing the opposite pole. Wait, in our universe, that's not possible because of the divergence of B being zero, right? Because the divergence of B equals rho_m, the magnetization, which is zero for free poles. But if they have isolated poles, that would change things.

So Maxwell's equations in our universe are four in total. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's law for electricity: divergence of E equals rho over epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: divergence of B equals zero.
3. Faraday's law: curl of E equals negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's law (with Maxwell's addition): curl of H equals J plus the time derivative of D.

Wait, but wait, in terms of the fields, sometimes people write Ampère's law using B and H. But the key is about the equations themselves.

In this alternate universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So that would imply that the divergence of B is not zero. Because in our universe, divergence of B is zero because there are no isolated magnetic charges. If you have isolated poles, then divergence of B would equal the magnetic charge density, similar to how divergence of E equals electric charge density.

So that changes the second equation, Gauss's law for magnetism. So equation 2 becomes non-zero. So equation 2 is modified.

But what about the other equations? Let me think. Faraday's law is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. Does having isolated poles affect that? I don't think so. Because Faraday's law is about how a changing B field induces an E field, which comes from the curl. So that equation probably remains the same.

Then, Ampère's law. In our universe, Ampère's law involves the curl of H, which is related to the current plus the displacement current (the time derivative of D). But if we're talking about Maxwell's equations, the ones involving the fields E and B, then Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition is:

curl B = mu_0 (J + epsilon_0 dE/dt )

Wait, in the original form, when written in terms of B, H, D, E, Gauss's laws, etc. So in the context of the question, which equations change?

So, the second equation, which is the divergence of B, would change because now you
