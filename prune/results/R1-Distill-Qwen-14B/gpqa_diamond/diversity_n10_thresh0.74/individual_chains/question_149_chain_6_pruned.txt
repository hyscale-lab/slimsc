Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think through it step by step. I'm just starting to learn about these techniques, so maybe I'll get it.

The question is about a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows peaks that are supposed to correspond to alpha-protons, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So that makes me think it's not a splitting due to coupling because the integral is correctâ€”so it's not like each is half of a doublet. But the problem says coupling is ruled out. Hmm.

Wait, the question says that the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. So spin-spin coupling (like between two protons) isn't the issue. That leaves other possibilities. Maybe something else is causing the splitting or extra peaks.

Then looking at the LC-MS part: when they run the crude compound at elevated temp, they get two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass. So same mass but different peaks. Hmm. If they have the same mass, maybe they're isomers or something else.

In NMR, if you have a double peak for the same proton, but same integral, it might be a diastereomer. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, the shifts are similar. Or maybe it's enantiomers? Enantiomers have the same NMR shifts because they are mirror images. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks, so that can't be enantiomers because they wouldn't split the peak.

Oh wait, but in the NMR, if the sample is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, each enantiomer would have the same NMR spectrum because they're mirror images. So why would there be two peaks? Maybe because of something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but the integrals add to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H? Or maybe each is about 0.5H, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the problem says that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So the same proton in the structure, but in different environments. So perhaps the molecule has some kind of symmetry that causes the same proton to split into two.

Hmm, another possibility is that the molecule has some kind of diastereomerism. Like, if there's a stereocenter and the molecule can form diastereomers, but in this case, maybe the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer. So in each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would have a slightly different shift, causing two peaks.

Looking at the options:

Option A
