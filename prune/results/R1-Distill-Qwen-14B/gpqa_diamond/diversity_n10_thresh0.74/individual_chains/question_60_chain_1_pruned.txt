Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a spacecraft traveling at a very high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options suggest it's either a short time or that they won't make it, so I think time dilation must be involved here.

Wait, time dilation is part of special relativity. Right, when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down for the traveler relative to a stationary observer. But from the astronaut's perspective, it's the Earth that's moving, so maybe length contraction comes into play? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about which effect to apply here.

Let me think about the scenario. The aliens are in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and Earth is their destination. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. So first, I need to find the distance between Earth and the LMC as observed from Earth. I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. Wait, is that right? I think the approximate distance is around 160,000 to 170,000 light-years, so let's say roughly 163,000 for this problem.

So the distance from Earth's frame of reference is 163,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, so from Earth's point of view, how long would the trip take? Time equals distance divided by speed. So time (t) = distance (d) / speed (v). Here, d is 163,000 light-years, and v is 0.99999987c. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so time in years would just be (163,000) / 0.99999987.

Let me calculate that. 163,000 divided by about 1 is roughly 163,000 years. But wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so the time would be almost the same as
