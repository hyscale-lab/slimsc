Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give the desired product.

First, let me draw the structure of the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the numbering could be a bit tricky, but let me visualize it.

Wait, position 1 is where the ethoxy is, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, in the ring, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That would make them adjacent, but wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta to each other. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to each other. Not sure, but perhaps I should think about the order in which these substituents are added.

In organic synthesis, the order of introducing substituents often matters because of directing effects. Benzene is a good starting point. Let me remember: when you add substituents to benzene, the first substituent will direct the next substitution. For example, if the first substituent is a nitro group, which is meta-directing, the next substituent will enter in specific positions.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents include an ethoxy group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group. Let's think about their directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors. Similarly, tert-butyl groups are bulky, but being an alkyl group, they are also ortho/para directors.

Wait, but wait. The substituents are: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). So ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl), while nitro is deactivating. The tert-butyl is a bulky activating group.

But when introducing substituents step by step, the order in which you add them will influence where the next group attaches. Let me think of the possible orderings.

The target molecule has three substituents. Let me list them: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So, the substituents are in adjacent positions, perhaps.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are across from each other (para positions
