Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what's going on here. The question involves several reaction steps, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo structures are norbornene derivatives. So the structure is a norbornene ring with a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. The tert-butoxy group is a bulky substituent, which might influence some reactions later on.

The first reaction is with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, what's this about? The reagents include sodium iodide, which is NaI. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an SN2 reaction.

Wait, the starting molecule has a diene, so perhaps it's undergoing some cycloaddition or another diene reaction. Oh, wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That structure has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexene.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a cyclohexene with two substituents, each being a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is -CH2Br2. So, each substituent is a methyl group with two bromine atoms attached.

When this reacts with sodium iodide, which is a good nucleophile, maybe it's an SN2 substitution. But wait, we have two equivalents, so maybe each end of the diene is reacting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, the starting material has a diene (bicyclo... -dien), and the other has a diene as well.

Wait, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene system which has a conjugated diene. So perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction is happening here. The diene (from norbornene) would act as the diene, and the dienophile would be the cyclohexene. But wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is itself a diene, not a dienophile. Hmm. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents with dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps each of those substituents is a leaving group. When NaI is present, the bromide ions (from NaI) might substitute for the dibromo groups. But each substituent has two bromines on a methyl group. So each substituent is -CH2Br2.

Wait, maybe each of those groups can undergo substitution. Since each substituent is -CH2Br2, which is like -CBr2H. So, when NaI is present, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. But with two equivalents of the dienophile, perhaps each of the two substituents is undergoing substitution twice.

Wait
