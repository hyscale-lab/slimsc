Okay, so I have this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy for a black hole is related to its area, right? The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area and the constants are Planck's, gravitational, and Boltzmann's. Right, that's the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.

The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon as θ = 1e-17 degrees. And the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. Wait, how do I get the size of the event horizon from that?

Oh right, the angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance. So θ ≈ r/d. But wait, θ in radians is (θ in degrees) * (π/(180)). So I'll need to convert that.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180) = (1e-17 degrees) * π / 180 ≈ (1e-17) * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, actually, let me calculate that more accurately. 1 degree is π/180 ≈ 0.0174533 radians. So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

2. The event horizon's radius r is approximately θ * d. So r = θ_rad * d.

But wait, d is given in parsecs. I should convert that to meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters.

So r = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m.

Calculating that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26
