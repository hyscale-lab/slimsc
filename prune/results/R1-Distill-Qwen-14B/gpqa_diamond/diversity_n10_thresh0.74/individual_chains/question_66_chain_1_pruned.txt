Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, what symmetries does the Standard Model respect?

I think the Standard Model has some fundamental symmetries. The big ones include Lorentz symmetry, which is about how the laws of physics work the same in all inertial frames. Then there's Poincaré symmetry, which combines Lorentz and translation symmetries. Oh wait, is Poincaré symmetry the same as Lorentz? No, Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translations, but Lorentz is a subset. So SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry since the Standard Model does.

What about other symmetries like C, P, T, and their combinations? The Standard Model is C and P violating, but it respects T in some cases. Wait, no, the Standard Model doesn't respect T symmetry on its own. For example, the CKM matrix leads to CP violation, but does it have T violation? I think the Standard Model actually doesn't have exact T symmetry, but it does respect CPT symmetry. Oh right, because CPT is a combination that's always a symmetry in quantum field theories, right? Because of the axioms of quantum mechanics, specifically the CPT theorem.

So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the Standard Model, should respect all the symmetries that the Standard Model respects. So Lorentz symmetry must be there, Poincaré as well? Or wait, is Poincaré included in Lorentz? No, Poincaré is a larger symmetry that includes translations. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are part of the framework. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, the SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators that are compatible with the Standard Model. So all SMEFT operators must be invariant under the Standard Model's symmetries. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry, because if an operator didn't, you couldn't have it in the theory as it would break Lorentz invariance.

Poincaré symmetry is a broader concept. Wait, but Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the theory already respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincaré
