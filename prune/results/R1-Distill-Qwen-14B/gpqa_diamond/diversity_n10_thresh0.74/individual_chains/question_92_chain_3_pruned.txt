Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. I think it's one of those branched alkenes because I see multiple CH3 groups attached and some double bonds.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy needed to break all bonds in an atom. So for carbon, which has four bonds, that's 1000 kJ/mol. So each C-C bond is 200 kJ/mol, that makes sense because each bond is a quarter of 1000? Wait no, wait. Oh wait, no, because each C atom in a C-C bond has two bonds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the bond energies given are for different bonds. So C-C is 200, C=C is 300, C-H is 400, and H-H is 100. But wait, H-H is 100, which I think is correct because I remember that H-H is around 432 kJ/mol, but maybe the values here are scaled or just for the problem. Oh, well, I'll go with the given numbers.

The task is to find the enthalpy of formation of the compound. Oh wait, the problem says "enthalpy of formation," but I remember that the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But in this case, maybe it's using bond energies to calculate it.

Wait, I think the approach here is to calculate the enthalpy change using the bond energies. So, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is something like:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formation enthalpy is calculated based on the bonds broken and formed. The formula is:

ΔH = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds broken)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds formed)]

Wait, but wait, no
