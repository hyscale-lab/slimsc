Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, specifically a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It usually involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene. But wait, this molecule isn't a diene, it's a bicyclic compound with a bridge. Oh right, I think the Cope rearrangement can also occur in certain bridged systems, maybe like norbornene derivatives.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a seven-membered ring with two bridges, one two-carbon and another two-carbon, and another bridge of one carbon. So, the structure is like norbornane but with seven carbons. The substituents: at position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but more accurately, a double bond), and at position 2, there's also an azabicyclo, meaning a nitrogen is part of the bridge. Wait, no, the 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the nitrogen is part of the bridge—so the bicyclo system has a bridge with a nitrogen atom. So the structure is similar to norbornene but with a nitrogen in one of the bridges.

The double bond is at position 5. So, the molecule is a bridged bicyclic compound with a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) attached at position 2. And the nitrogen is part of the bridge, so that's a bridge between carbons 1 and 4 perhaps? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: bicyclo[m.n.p] means the bridge lengths. So for bicyclo[2.2.1], the three bridges are of lengths 2, 2, and 1 carbons. So the main bridge is length 1 (so that's the bridge between adjacent carbons, like a fused ring), and the other two bridges are longer.

In this case, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the position numbering: the nitrogen is at position 2, perhaps
