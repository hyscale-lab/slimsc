Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, first, what does regularization mean? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities temporarily so you can calculate finite results.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization when you go to high energies. High energies usually mean that quantum effects are significant, so perhaps we're looking at which theories don't have these divergences.

Let me go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations, right? So that's a classical theory, not a quantum one. Since it doesn't involve quantum mechanics, it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that quantum theories do. Wait, but wait, classical E&M does have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charged particle, but those don't require regularization because you don't quantize it. So when you're working in the classical framework, you don't use regularization techniques because those are quantum methods. So perhaps D is the right answer because it's classical.

But wait, the question is about high energies. High energies typically lead to quantum effects, but classical E
