Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Those two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Hmm, so each peak is about half a proton. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other because of neighboring protons.

Then there's the LC-MS. It shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So mass-wise, they're the same, but they're showing up as two separate peaks. Oh, wait—so the mass is the same, so it's not a fragment or a fragment cluster. Also, same mass, so it's not like a different isomer with a different molecular weight.

Let me think about possible reasons for these observations. The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction, like a coupling or something. If the LC-MS shows the same mass, I don't think that's it. So maybe A is not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight, so that fits the mass spec. In NMR, enantiomers have the same chemical shift because they're identical except for the spatial arrangement. Wait, but in an NMR, wouldn't a racemic mixture just show a single peak for each set of equivalent protons? Because the environment is the same for each proton. Wait, no wait: wait, in an enantiomer, the protons that are equivalent in the same environment would have the same shift. So if you have two enantiomers, the NMR would show the same peak because the peaks overlap. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks. But the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe if two different groups are coupling in the reaction, leading to two different products. But how does that affect the NMR and LC-MS. If the product is a mixture of diastereomers, for example, that could cause splitting in NMR. But the question says that the coupling isn't spin-spin because the pattern rules that out. Wait, but the double coupling in the reaction—like maybe during the formation of the amide bond, two different possible stereoisomers form, leading to diastereomers. So that would cause different shifts in NMR. But the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Hmm. Wait, but diastereomers have different NMR shifts, but in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe that's not it.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe they're diastereomers that are close in structure, causing similar shifts. Also, in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute to a peak. So for a given proton, each diastereomer would have a different shift. But if they are in a mixture, but the shifts are similar, perhaps the peaks are overlapping or close enough to appear as two separate
