Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it. 

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, induced charges come into play. Oh right, when a charge is near a conducting sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, some of the induced charge will be neutralized by the ground. So the sphere's induced charge will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge placed near it, but only up to the point where the sphere's capacitance is considered.

Wait, so the conducting sphere being grounded means that it's connected to the Earth, which is a large conductor. So any excess charge on the sphere can flow into the Earth. So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. But the induced charge would be -q because the conducting sphere is neutral to begin with. But wait, because it's grounded, that -q would flow away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of zero? Or does the sphere have an induced charge of -q and remain connected, but since it's a conductor, the charges redistribute.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conducting sphere is neutral initially. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the side opposite the charge q, creating a redistribution of charges. Since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will separate. But because the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave the sphere. So the induced charge on the sphere would be -q, but since it's connected to ground, the sphere will neutralize that by allowing electrons to flow in or out. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the external charge is positive, the sphere's electrons would move towards the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the extra positive charge on the far side can't stay because the ground can supply electrons. So maybe the sphere's induced charge is -q on the near side, but the far side would have some induced charge that's positive, but since the sphere is neutral overall, the net induced charge on the sphere would be zero. Hmm, that might not be right.

Wait, no. The initial induced charge on the sphere is such that the external charge q would induce a charge -q on the near side, but due to grounding, the sphere can lose or gain electrons. So the sphere's net charge would be zero, but there's an induced dipole or redistribution. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere acts like a capacitor. The charge q is placed outside, and the sphere, being a conductor, will have induced charges. Since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere must be zero. Because the conducting sphere is an equipotential. So the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but the potential due to the external charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere will have induced surface charges such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Because it's grounded. So the potential at the surface is the sum of potentials from q and from the induced charges. But since the sphere is an equipotential, and it's connected to ground (which is at zero potential
