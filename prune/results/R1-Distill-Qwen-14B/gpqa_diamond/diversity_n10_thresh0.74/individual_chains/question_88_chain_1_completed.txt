Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? The inner capsid proteins are the ones that are usually more antigenic, I think. They're using GFP to tag these proteins, so when the mice are given the rotavirus via oral gavage, the proteins are being delivered to the gut.

Stomach acid can destroy some of these tagged proteins. Stomach acid is strong, so maybe some of the GFP gets broken down. But some make it through the mucus in the intestines and reach the secondary lymphoid organs. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), specifically located in the small intestine. They're sites where immune responses to enteric pathogens are initiated.

So the fluorescent Peyer's patches indicate that the rotavirus proteins reached there. Then, they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in the lymphoid tissue are likely B cells, because when an antigen is present, B cells get activated, start proliferating, and undergo various processes like somatic hypermutation and class switching.

When they sequence the variable heavy chain genes, they observe high variability. The variable regions of the immunoglobulins (antibodies) are where diversity comes from. The variable heavy chain gene diversity arises from a few processes—VDJ recombination during B cell development, and later, somatic hypermutation.

Wait, let me think. VDJ recombination happens in the bone marrow during the formation of B cells. It's the process where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the unique variable region of the B cell receptor. This occurs during the maturation of B cells, so all B cells have this variability from the start.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell has been activated by an antigen. It's a process that introduces mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, leading to increased diversity of the antibodies produced. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like Peyer's patches.

In this case, the question says the variable heavy chain gene has high variability. So, the process happening here is probably somatic hypermutation because that's when the B cells are actively proliferating and diversifying their antibodies in response to the antigen.

Let me look at the options:

A) somatic hypermutation – this fits with the scenario of the B cells in the Peyer's patches undergoing proliferation and diversifying their receptors after activation.

B) complement activation – not sure how that relates here. Complement is part of the immune response but doesn't directly explain the variability in the variable regions.

C) class switching recombination – this is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's a different process that happens after the initial diversification.

D) VDJ recombination – this is during B cell development, but after that, the VDJ regions are fixed. Somatic hypermutation occurs after, so the high variability observed is more likely due to somatic hypermutation.

So, putting it all together: the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences comes from somatic hypermutation occurring in the activated B cells in the Peyer's patches. That's option A.


The scenario involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence from the GFP-tagged proteins is observed in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut. After isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches, sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. This variability is indicative of a process that occurs after B cell activation and is responsible for generating diverse antibody sequences.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers, where activated B cells undergo proliferation and introduce mutations in the variable regions of their immunoglobulin genes. This explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: While complement is part of the immune response, it does not directly contribute to the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not account for the variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of the variable regions. However, it does not explain the additional variability observed in this scenario.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after B cell activation in the Peyer's patches. This process diversifies the antibody repertoire to respond to the rotavirus antigen.
