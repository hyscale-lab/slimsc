Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, why does the effective temperature decrease when spots are present? Oh right, because dark spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall emission is less, which brings down the effective temperature. But how exactly does that tie into the question about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this case, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Wait, that's about 1448 angstroms, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. But I'm not sure how the wavelength directly helps yet. Oh, wait, the energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed
