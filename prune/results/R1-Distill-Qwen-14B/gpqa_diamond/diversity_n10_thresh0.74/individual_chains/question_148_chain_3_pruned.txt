Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of them, and each is a compound A1 through A5.

First, let me read the problem again to catch all the details. So, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (that's room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Then, A3 can interact with xenon too, and it's obtained by fluorinating Y. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, you get A5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. The question is about the molecular weight of A4, and the options are given.

Wait, I think I should figure out what each compound is. Let's start with A1. It's a binary compound with fluorine, bright red, and decomposes into A2 and F2. Oh, wait, the decomposition reaction probably releases fluorine. So maybe A1 is something like F2Y, but I'm not sure. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's under normal conditions. Maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. What oxidizes xenon? Maybe something with a high oxidation state.

Oh, wait, when fluorine reacts with metals, it forms various fluorides. For example, F2, ClF, etc. But in this case, Y is another element. Wait, Y is a metal? Or maybe a non-metal? Because fluorine binary compounds can be with metals or non-metals.

Wait, another thought: when a compound decomposes into another compound and fluorine, maybe it's a decomposition where fluorine is released. So A1 → A2 + F2. So maybe A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower one. For example, maybe A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF or something. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon in normal conditions is pretty inert, but maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. Could A
