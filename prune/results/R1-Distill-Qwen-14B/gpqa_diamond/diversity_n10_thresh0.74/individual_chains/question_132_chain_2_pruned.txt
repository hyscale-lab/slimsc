Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. Let's see what it's all about. Hmm, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C10H14 for each compound. Wait, no, the mixture is 1:1, so each compound is C10H14? Or is it that the mixture as a whole has that formula? Wait, no, each of the compounds must have the same molecular formula because the mixture is 1:1, right? Because if they were different, the ratio might not make sense in terms of molecular formula. So both compounds must be C10H14.

Looking at the options, all options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have a different molecular formula. Let's think about that. Benzene (C6H6) with two ethyl groups. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be C4H10. So the molecular formula would be C10H16. Wait, but the compounds in the question are C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H16. Therefore, if one of the options in the question includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, that compound would have a different molecular formula, so it can't be in the mixture because the mixture has a 1:1 ratio of the two C10H14 compounds. So that would eliminate any options that include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Looking at the options, option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which is C10H16. Therefore, option C is not possible because the mixture is C10H14. So I can eliminate option C.

So the remaining options are A, B, D. All of these options consist of two tetramethylbenzenes. Let's look at their structures.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: So the benzene ring has four methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. That's a symmetric arrangement. Alternatively, I can think of it as a 1,2,4,5-tetra-substituted ring. How does that look? Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Oh wait, 1,2 are adjacent, and 4,5 are adjacent. So perhaps it's a para arrangement? Or maybe it's like two adjacent methyl groups in 1,2 and another adjacent pair in 4,5. Wait, maybe it's 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl, which would mean that the substituents are in positions 1,2,4,5. So, 1 is next to 2, which is next to 6. Hmm, perhaps it's a structure where the substituents are in a 1,2 and 4,5 positions, making some symmetry.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each compound's structure and their NMR signals.

The NMR spectrum of the mixture shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm. Each is a singlet, and the ratio is 1:1. Also, three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the aromatic protons. Each compound contributes some protons in the aromatic region. Since the mixture is 1:1, each compound's aromatic protons would produce a signal that's proportional to their number. But wait, the NMR shows two signals in the aromatic region, each a singlet, and in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound has a single set of equivalent aromatic protons, and the two compounds each have different numbers of protons?

Wait, but wait, in the mixture, each compound is present in 1:1 ratio. So if one compound has, say, 2 equivalent aromatic protons, and the other has 4, then the area under the peaks would be in a 2:4 = 1:2 ratio. But the question says the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, that complicates things. Or maybe each compound has the same number of aromatic protons, but they are split into different signals.

Wait, but the question states that in the aromatic region, there are two signals (two singlets) in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, and each contributes equally in area. So each singlet corresponds to one compound's aromatic protons. So each singlet represents the aromatic region of each compound. So the integration would be 1:1 between the two compounds, which makes sense as they are in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound has one set of equivalent aromatic pro
