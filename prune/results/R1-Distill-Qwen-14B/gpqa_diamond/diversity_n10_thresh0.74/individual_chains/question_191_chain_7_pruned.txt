Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each reaction does and how the structure changes.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I should probably draw that structure to visualize. So, cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2?) Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent that's attached to the cyclohexane at the 2nd carbon of the propene. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no, structure-wise, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, maybe I should think of it as (CH2)2CH. Wait, no. Let me correct. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when you take the prop-1-en-2-yl group, it's the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached? No, wait. Wait, I think prop-1-en-2-yl is actually (CH2)2CH with a double bond. Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The substituent is a propenyl group attached at the middle carbon. So, the structure is (CH2)2C=CH2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So structure is CH2=C(CH2)-, but wait, that's not
