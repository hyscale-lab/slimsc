Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question talks about several reactions and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. I remember that molecular symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So I need to figure out what E is first.

Let me go through each reaction to understand the compounds involved.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 1:8 in the reaction. I'm thinking of metals reacting with gases. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? Because when metals react with halogens, they often form compounds. For example, sodium and chlorine form NaCl, but that's 1:1. Wait, but here it's 8 equivalents. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Let me think.

Another possibility: Could B be O2? If A is a metal, maybe it forms an oxide. But the product C is bright red. Oh, wait, I remember that lead(II,IV) oxide is bright red. But lead usually has a +2 or +4 charge. If A is lead, then reacting with O2? Let me think about the reaction: Pb (solid) + O2 (gas) → PbO2? But the stoichiometry here is 4 Pb + 5 O2 → 2 PbO2. So that's 4 Pb for 5 O2. Not 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. If A is iron, for example, iron reacts with Cl2 in certain conditions. FeCl3 forms when Fe reacts with Cl2, but the stoichiometry is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. That's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Fe. Not 8. Maybe another metal?

Wait, what about something like aluminum? Aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a
