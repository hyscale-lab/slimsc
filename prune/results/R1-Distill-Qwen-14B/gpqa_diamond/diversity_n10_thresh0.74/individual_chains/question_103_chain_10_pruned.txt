Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break this down.

First, the target structure. The phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, numbering the benzene ring... So, if the main chain is ethan-1-one, that means the ketone is attached to the benzene at position 1. Then, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, the substituents are bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. Or wait, maybe I should draw it out.

So, the benzene ring has a ketone (ethan-1-one) at position 1. Then, position 3 is Br, and position 5 is NO2. So, the substituents are meta to each other relative to the ketone group. Wait, the positions are 3 and 5 from the ketone. Hmm, let me think about that. So, the ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group. So, the arrangement is 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the three substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

Now, the options are sequences of reactions starting from benzene. I need to figure out which sequence will yield this product with high yield.

The target molecule has two nitro groups and a bromine. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to ethan-1-one. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So, the benzene ring is substituents in positions 1 (attached to the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, that would make them in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group,
