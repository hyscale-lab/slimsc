Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate of the state multiplied by the operator acting on the state, all integrated. But since this is for a spin-½ particle, it's probably simpler.

First, let me note that the state is given as a linear combination of σz eigenstates. So, the state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me check that this is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1.

0.5 squared is 0.25. (√3/2)^2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, no need to normalize it.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value ⟨ψ | (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

I can separate this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to calculate the expectation values of σz and σx.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is easy. The state ψ is a linear combination:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * ⟨↑|σz|↑⟩ + |(√3/2)|^2 * ⟨↓|σz|↓⟩.

Wait, right. Because when you compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, each term is the coefficient squared times the corresponding eigenvalue. So σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

So,

⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1)
= (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1)
= 0.25 -0.75
= -0.5.

So that part gives ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Next, the σx expectation. This is a bit trickier. Because σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so the expectation value isn't as straightforward.

The general formula for ⟨σx⟩ is given by:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Wait, but σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So acting on |↑⟩, which is [1;0], σx gives [0,1;1,0][1;0] = [0;1] = |↓⟩. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, let me compute ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So, ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

So, let me write ψ as a column vector. Let's say |↑⟩ is [1;0], |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] times [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me compute it.

Wait, ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. σx ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], because σx swaps the components.

So ψ† σx ψ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So compute 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is 0.5* sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5.

Wait, that's two terms adding up. Let me compute each.

First term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Second term: same thing, so total is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, am I doing that right? Because I think I might be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 * ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ + a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + a* b ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

But since σx |↑⟩=|↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩=|↑⟩, so:

⟨
