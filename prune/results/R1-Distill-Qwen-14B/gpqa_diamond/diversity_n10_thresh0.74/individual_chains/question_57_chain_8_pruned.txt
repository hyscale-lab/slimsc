Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role, especially when it comes to calculating things like cross-sections or phase shifts. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So I guess we only consider these five phase shifts.

Wait, I remember that in partial wave analysis, each phase shift δ_l corresponds to a specific angular momentum state l. So δ₀ is for l=0, δ₁ for l=1, and so on up to l=4 here.

The scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed as a sum over all the partial waves. The general formula is something like (1/(2ik)) times the sum of ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{2iδ_l} )) times the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression.

Wait, no, the optical theorem comes into play here. The optical theorem relates the total cross-section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Oh right, the theorem says that (4π/k) Im[f(0,0)] equals the total cross-section σ_total. But wait, in this problem, they're directly asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is along θ=0°, φ=0°, right? So f(0,0) is the scattering amplitude at that point.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0,0)].

The formula for f(0,0) is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l )/(1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) multiplied by something else? Or maybe I should think in terms of partial wave expansion.

Alternatively, the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l}
