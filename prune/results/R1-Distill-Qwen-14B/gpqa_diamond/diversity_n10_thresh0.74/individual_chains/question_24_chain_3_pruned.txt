Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, mainly involving hydrogenation and disproportionation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll try to remember. So, first, let's parse the problem.

So, there's a mixture X which is equimolar and decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that mixture X has some unsaturated compounds because bromine water is typically decolorized by alkenes or alkynes. Like, for example, ethylene or something like that.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction, forming mixture Y. Mixture Y is also equimolar, but its two liquids don't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components must be completely saturated because they don't react with bromine anymore. Also, the fact that it's a result of a disproportionation reaction gives another clue. Disproportionation is when one species is both oxidized and reduced. Classic examples are the disproportionation of alcohols or maybe even some alkenes.

Next, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they produce a single hydrocarbon Z. And Z is a solvent widely used, which makes me think of something like hexane or maybe toluene, but wait, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 

Hydrogen's atomic weight is about 1.008, so let's see. Let's say the formula of Z is CnH2m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2m * 1.008)/(12n + 2m *1.008) = 0.1428. Let's approximate 1.008 as 1 for simplicity. So (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428. Multiply both sides by denominator: 2m = 0.1428*(12n + 2m). Let's compute:

2m = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428*2m
2m - 0.2856m = 1.7136n
1.7144 m = 1.7136n (approximately)
So m ≈ n. Because 1.7144 ≈ 1.7136, so m ≈ n.

So the formula is roughly CnH2n. Wait, that's the formula for ethylene, but ethylene would be C2H4. Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon, so possibly an alkene? But wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's already saturated. Oh wait, but if Z is an alkene, it would react with H2. So maybe Z isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%. Let's compute that precisely. 14.28% is 0.1428. So hydrogen is 1/7 approximately, because 1/7 is about 0.142857.

So, H is 1/7 of the total mass. So, the molecular formula must be such that the number of H atoms corresponds to 1/7 of total mass.

Let's think of possible hydrocarbons. Let's consider alkanes, which are saturated. For example, if it's an alkane, formula is CnH2n+2.

So, the mass fraction of hydrogen in CnH2n+2 is (2n+2)*1 / (12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n+2) = (n+1)/(7n+1).

We know this equals 0.1428, which is approximately 1/7. Let me set up the equation:

(n+1)/(7n+1) ≈ 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 7(n+1) ≈ 7n +1.

7n +7 ≈7n +1.

7 ≈1, which is not possible. So maybe it's not an alkane. What about cyclohexane? No, same formula, since cyclohexane is C6H12. Wait, but cyclohexane is an alkane, so same as C6H14?

Wait, maybe Z isn't an alkane. What if it's a ring structure, but that might not change the hydrogen count. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic compound. Wait, but the question says that Z doesn't react with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. Benzene is unsaturated and would react, so no, Z can't be benzene. So maybe something else.

Wait another approach: Let's take the mass fraction of H as 14.28% (which is approximately 1/7). So, for a molecule, the total mass is 7 parts, with 1 part H. So the ratio H:C is (1/12) (since 12 parts C and 1 part H). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of moles.

Wait, the mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is about 1/7. So for a molecule, molar mass is sum of all atoms. Let's consider a molecule with H as 1/7 of total mass.

Let me take an example: suppose Z is C3H8. Its molecular weight is (3*12)+(8*1) = 36 +8=44. H mass is 8, so 8/44 = 0.1818, which is 18.18%, not 14.28%.

Another example: C4H10. Molar mass is 4*12 +10=48+10=58. H is 10, so 10/58≈0.1724, 17.24%, not 14.28%.

What about C2H4? Its molar mass is 24 +4=28. H is 4/28=1/7≈0.1428. Ah! So C2H4 has exactly 14.28% H. But wait, C2H4 is ethylene, which is an alkene. If we hydrogenate it under severe conditions, wouldn't it hydrogenate further to ethane (C2H6)? But the problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. So ethylene would react more, but maybe Z is ethane, which is fully saturated.

Wait, but ethane is C2H6. Let's compute its H mass fraction. (6 *1)/(2*12 +6*1) =6/(24+6)=6/30=0.2, 20%. Not 14.28%. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, earlier I thought Z could be C2H4 because that gives 14.28% H, but then Z is an alkene, which would react further with hydrogen. But the problem states that Z doesn't react further, meaning it must be a fully saturated compound. So maybe Z is something else.

Wait
