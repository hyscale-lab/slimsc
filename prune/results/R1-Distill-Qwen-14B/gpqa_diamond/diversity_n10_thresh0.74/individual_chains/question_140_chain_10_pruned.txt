Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what each part is telling me.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, I think. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent.

Hmm. Let me break this down piece by piece.

First, I'll try to identify the components. The reaction is between X and Y, producing W, G. Then, G upon heating gives B.

So, the reaction equation might look like X + Y → W ↑ + G. Then, G → B upon heating.

The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That suggests that the molecule is something like H2O (but wait, H2O's molecule has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton, O has 8. So protons: 2 + 8 =10, neutrons: 0 + 8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, what about CO2? No, that's O=8 protons, C=6. CO2 has 2 O atoms. So protons: 6 + 16 =22. Neutrons: 6 (C has 6 neutrons if it's carbon-12) + 16 (O has 8 neutrons each, so 16 total). So 6+16=22. Oh wait, that's 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that would fit. But wait, wait CO2 has a molecular mass of 44, right? Or maybe another molecule.

Wait, what about CH4? No, CH4 has 6 protons (C) + 4 H =6+4=10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (if carbon-12), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6, doesn't match.

Another option: NH3. Nitrogen has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So 7 +3=10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (if N-14), H has 0. So 7. That's 10 vs 7. Not equal.

Wait, maybe H2O? No, earlier thought. Alternatively, maybe another molecule. Wait, maybe O2? O2 has 16 protons per O, so 32. Neutrons: 8 per O, so 16 in total. 32 protons vs 16 neutrons. Not same. Hmm.

Wait, maybe O3? 3 O atoms. 3*
