Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles being collided in a detector, right? And these particles decay quickly. So the question is about the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of them to reach the detector's inner walls, whereas previously only one-third did at a Lorentz factor of 20.

Wait, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Oh right, because particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds will experience less time due to their speed, so their decay time appears shorter from our lab frame.

So the problem is about the proper time (the particle's own time) and how much time it has before decaying. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The particles are moving straight towards the walls, I guess, so the distance they need to cover is 30 meters.

Let me think. The number of particles reaching the detector walls depends on whether they decay before reaching the wall. The probability that a particle doesn't decay before traveling that distance depends on the time it has, which relates to its lifetime as measured in the lab frame.

Wait, particles have a mean lifetime tau in their rest frame. From our frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau because of time dilation. So the time available for the particle to reach the detector wall is the time it takes to go 30 meters at its speed.

The speed can be approximated as the speed of light for ultra-relativistic particles since gamma is 20, which is a high value. So speed v is approximately c.

So the time for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 m / c. 

The probability that the particle doesn't decay before this time is exp(-t / (gamma tau)), but wait, wait. No, wait, no. The decay process is a Poisson process, so the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t / tau_lab), where tau_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. And tau_lab is gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

So the probability P that the particle survives to reach the wall is exp(-t / (gamma tau_0)).

Wait, no, let me clarify:

The proper lifetime is tau_0. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(
