Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula I remember is that you calculate the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds and subtract the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy of formation is the reverse of that. No, wait, the standard approach is to use the energies of the bonds in the reactants and products to calculate the overall enthalpy change. So, I think the formula is: Enthalpy of reaction (Î”H) = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products). Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, wait. Because when bonds break, it's endothermic, so energy is absorbed. When bonds form, energy is released. So for the formation reaction, we're starting from elements and forming compounds. So, the enthalpy of formation would involve the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the bonds in the product (the molecule in question).

Wait, but the problem here is about the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule, so maybe I should think about the formation reaction. For example, if the molecule is C6H14 or something, the reaction would be 6 C ( graphite ) + something H2 to make the molecule. But in this problem, the molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2
