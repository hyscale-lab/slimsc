Alright, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, okay, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and maybe some other factors like albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. Cool.

The question gives me data on two planets (Planet1 and Planet2) orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii, but I think the mass might not matter here because equilibrium temperature depends on distance and the star's properties.

Wait, but how do I find their distances from the star? Oh, right, the radial velocity method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star. The bigger the Doppler shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think. Oh wait, but Doppler shift also depends on the planet's orbital speed, which relates to the distance.

The problem says that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. So, the shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but maybe they're giving the velocity directly through the shift? Or perhaps the shift is inversely proportional to the velocity?

Wait, let me think. The Doppler shift (delta_lambda) is given by (delta_lambda / lambda) = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. But wait, the problem says the shift is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2. But the emission line is at 6300 Å, so delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1. So, let's compute the velocity.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å. So delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 = 0.00000476. Then v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). Wait, c is about 3e5 km/s. Let me calculate that.

0.00000476 * 3e5 km/s = 0.00000476 * 300,000 = approx 1.428 km/s. So the star's velocity is about 1.428 km/s for Planet1. Similarly, for Planet2, delta_lambda is 0.04, so 0.04/6300 = ~0.000006349. Multiply by 3e5 km/s: 0.000006349 * 3e5 = approx 1.9047 km/s.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K is higher for Planet2, which tells me that it's either more massive or closer to the star. Since the RV method depends on the planet's mass and its distance (actually, the distance in terms of orbital period and mass), but I think for this problem, since both planets are detected via RV, I can model their velocities.

Wait, but how does the RV velocity relate to the planet's orbital distance? I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) )

But since the planets have much smaller masses than the star, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. Also, the problem states that the orbits are circular, so e=0. So the formula becomes:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * (1) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the star's velocity. Another way: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period P, the planet's mass, and the star's mass.

Alternatively, I remember that Kepler's third law relates the period and the semi-major axis (a) as:

P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3

Again, since M_planet is much smaller, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So:

P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³

So, a³ ≈ G M_star P² / (4π²)

But how does this tie into the RV semi-amplitude K? Oh right, the RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is K, and the relation between K and the planet's orbital parameters is:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2)

But again, assuming e=0 and M_planet << M_star, it simplifies. Let me look for another approach.

I think the RV semi-amplitude K can be approximated by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But maybe it's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that the RV velocity K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the ratio of the velocities can help me find the ratio of their semi-major axes. Since both planets are detected via RV, K1 and K2 are the velocities, and assuming the same inclination (maybe i=90 degrees for both), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assumed to be the same for both. Alternatively, perhaps the RV shifts are inversely proportional to their semi-major axes?

Wait, let's think in terms of the star's motion. The star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass. The semi-major axis of the star's orbit (a*) is given by a* = (M_planet/(M_star + M_planet)) * a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star. But again, since M_planet is much less than M_star, a* ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a.

The velocity of the star is v* = 2π a* / P, where P is the orbital period. So v* is proportional to a* / P. But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star). So P = (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2). Substituting into v*:

v* = (2π a* ) / ( (4π² a³/(G M_star))^(1/2) ) )

= 2π a* * sqrt(G M_star/(4π² a³)) )

= 2π a* * sqrt(G M_star) / (2 π a^(3/2)) )

Simplify: 2π cancels, so:

= a* * sqrt( G M_star ) / ( a^(3/2) )

But a* is (M_planet / M_star) a, so substituting:

= (M_planet/M_star a) * sqrt(G M_star) / a^(3/2)

= (M_planet/M_star) * sqrt(G M_star) / a^(1/2)

= (M_planet / a^(1/2)) ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / M_star^(1/2) )

= M_planet * sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( a M_star ) )

Hmm, getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's easier to express the velocity in terms of the orbital period and planet mass. From another approach, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (1) / (c) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )

But since e=0 and M_planet << M_star, K ≈ (G M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(1/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ratio of K1 to K2.

We have K1 = 1.428 km/s, K2 = 1.9047 km/s. Let's take the ratio K2/K1 = 1.9047 / 1.428 ≈ 1.334.

Since K is proportional to (M_planet / a^(1/2)) ) * sqrt( G M_star ), but wait, perhaps I should think of K as being proportional to (M_planet) * ( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^-1/3 ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/(P^(1/3)) )

But maybe it's easier to consider the formula for K as:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me recall the formula for the RV semi-amplitude:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

Since e=0, and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

Assuming sin i is the same for both planets (maybe edge-on, i=90°, so sin i=1), then the ratio K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * ( P1 / P2 )^(-1/3 )

But wait, wait, no. Let me re-express it. Since K is proportional to (M_planet ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

So, K is proportional to ( M_planet ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Wait, is that correct? Because if I rearrange:

K ∝ (M_planet) / ( P^(1/3) )

But how does P relate to a (semi-major axis)?

From Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

So P ∝ ( a^3 / M_star )^(1/2 )

Thus, P^(1/3) ∝ ( a^3 / M_star )^(1/6 )

Which is a^(1/2) / M_star^(1/6 )

So, substituting back into K's proportionality:

K ∝ (M_planet) / ( a^(1/2) / M_star^(1/6) ) )

= M_planet * M_star^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )

Alternatively, K ∝ M_planet * (M_star)^(1/6) / (a)^(1/2 )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should instead express a in terms of K, M_planet, and M_star.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the ratio of the semi-major axes a1 and a2 of planet1 and planet2.

Given that K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/2) )

Because, from earlier, K ∝ M_planet * (M_star)^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )

But since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both. So, the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * (a2 / a1 )^(1/2 )

Wait, let me set that up again.

K ∝ M_planet * (M_star)^(1/6) / a^(1/2 )

But since M_star is the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/2 )

We can rearrange this to find a2/a1.

So,

a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute that.

Given that K1=1.428 km/s, K2=1.9047 km/s. So K1/K2 ≈ 1.428 / 1.9047 ≈ 0.75.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M2/M1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So,

a2/a1 = [ (0.75) * (5/7) ]^2 = [ (0.75 * 0.714) ]^2 ≈ (0.5355)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So a2 is about 0.287 times a1. That is, a1 is larger than a2. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because a higher RV shift (K2 > K1) would mean the planet is closer, right? Because a closer planet would cause a higher velocity in the star.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me think again.

If K is proportional to (M_planet) / (a^(1/2) ), then a larger a would lead to a smaller K for the same M_planet.

So, if Planet2 has a larger K than Planet1, then a2 is smaller than a1. Because K2 > K1 → a2 < a1.

So, according to our calculation, a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, so a2 is smaller than a1. That makes sense because the planet causing a larger RV shift is closer to the star.

So, the semi-major axes are a1 and a2, with a1 > a2.

Now, to find the equilibrium temperature ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2), the formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But since both have the same albedo, that term cancels out. So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) * sqrt( (R_star) / (R_star) ) ) ) * ( ... )

Wait, no, let me correct that. The formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So, for Planet1 and Planet2,

T_eq1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

T_eq2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) * (1 - A)^(1/4 )

So the ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sqrt(R/(2 a1)) / sqrt(R/(2 a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, a2/a1 = 0.287, so sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So, T_eq1 is about 0.536 times T_eq2. So the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 is approximately 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the proportionality earlier.

Wait, when I set up the ratio K1/K2 = (M1 / M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Solving for sqrt(a2/a1 ) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1 )

So,

sqrt(a2/a1 ) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1 )

Therefore, (a2/a1 ) = [ (K1/K2) * (M2/M1) ]^2

Plugging the numbers in:

K1/K2 = 0.75, M2/M1 =5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So,

(0.75) * (0.714) = 0.5355

(0.5355)^2 ≈ 0.2868, so a2/a1 ≈ 0.287. So, that part was correct.

Thus, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So the ratio is approximately 0.536. Which is about 0.54, but the option is 0.53, option C.

Wait, but what about the star's radius? The formula for equilibrium temperature includes the star's radius, right?

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

So, if the star's radius is larger, then the equilibrium temperature is higher for the same a. But in our case, the star's radius is given as 1.2 solar radii. Wait, but in the ratio, T_eq1 / T_eq2, the R_star terms cancel out:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because R_star is same for both.

So, the calculation I did is correct. Because in the ratio, R_star terms cancel.

Therefore, the ratio is approximately 0.536, which is closest to option C (~0.53).


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Here, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_{\text{planet}}\), the orbital period \(P\), and the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\) via the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

For circular orbits and assuming the same inclination angle for both planets, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_2}{M_1}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{km/s}\), \(K_2 = 1.9047 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{1.428}{1.9047} \approx 0.75, \quad \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.5355
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5355)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Finally, substituting \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5355\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5355
\]

This corresponds to approximately \(0.53\), which matches option C.

**Answer: C**
