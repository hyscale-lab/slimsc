Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm. Let me try to go through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options given are for the minimum resolution, and I need to find the correct one.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the minimum resolution needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So I think this has to do with the particles traveling a certain distance before decaying, and the detector's ability to measure that distance.

I remember that the lifetime of a particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But how does that tie into the distance the particle travels before decaying?

Oh right, the distance (L) the particle travels is v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. But wait, velocity v can be found using the energy and mass. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, but the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So maybe I can find the velocity from that.

Wait, the energy of a relativistic particle is E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Let me compute γ first. The mass m is 3.41 GeV/c², and energy E is 27 GeV. So γ = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.918. Hmm, approximately 7.92.

Then, τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s = about 6.336e-15 seconds.

But wait, I should probably use exact numbers to be precise. Let me calculate γ more accurately. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me do that: 3.41 goes into 27 how many times? 3.41 *7 is 23.87, 3.41*7.9 is 3.41*(7+0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939, which is about 27. So γ is approximately 7.918, yeah.

So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 = let's compute that. 8*7.918 is 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s = 6.3344e-15 s.

Now, the distance L the particle travels is v * τ. But I need to find v. Alternatively, since we're working in natural units where c=1, but I'm not sure if I should include c here. Let me think. In particle physics, often c is set to 1, but when working in SI units, I need to include it.

Wait, maybe better to compute the velocity. The velocity v can be found from β = v/c, and since γ = 1/√(1 - β²), I can find β.

Given γ = 7.918, so 1 - β² = 1/γ² = 1/(7.918)^2 ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.01596. So β² = 1 - 0.01596 = 0.98404, so β ≈ sqrt(0.98404). Let me compute that. The sqrt of 0.984 is approximately 0.992, perhaps? Because 0.992² is about 0.984. Let's check: 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.992^2 = (0.99 +0.002)^2 = 0.99² + 2*(0.99)(0.002) + (0.002)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004 ≈ 0.984064. Oh, that's very close to 0.98404. So β is approximately 0.992.

So the velocity v is 0.992c. But wait, c is the speed of light, which is about 3e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = 0.992c * τ.

Wait, τ is the dilated lifetime, which we found as 6.3344e-15 seconds. So substituting:

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s.

Let me compute that.

0.992 * 3e8 = approx 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3344e-15 s: 2.976e8 * 6.3344e-15 = Let's compute that.

First, 2.9
