Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given a moving point charge q. The setup is that the charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a time t which is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. Oh right, tr is the time when the charge was at the position that created the field we're observing.

I remember that for a moving charge, the potentials are not just the static case anymore because the charge is in motion. So the potentials probably depend on the velocity of the charge. Let's think about the formulas for V and A in the case of a moving charge.

Wait, scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Oh right, I think the scalar potential is still similar to the static case but might have a factor involving the velocity, or maybe not. Let me recall.

The scalar potential V is typically (q)/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, does r change? Or does the expression get modified? Hmm. Oh wait, no, because V is the static potential, but when the charge is moving, the fields are not just static anymore. Or maybe V is still the same, but the vector potential comes into play.

Wait, the vector potential A is given by some expression involving the velocity of the charge. I think the general form for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times something over the distance, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I should think about the retarded potentials. Because the charge was at position r' at time tr, which is the time when the field was generated. So the fields at time t come from the charge's position and velocity at tr. So the potentials are advanced or retarded? Oh, since t > tr, it's the retarded potentials.

The scalar potential V(r, t) is the same as the static potential but evaluated at the retarded position. So V would be q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at the time tr. But wait, r is the current position of the field point, and r' is the position of the charge at tr. So in terms of the vector d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, then d = r - r'. So the distance from the charge at tr to the field point is |d|.

Wait, but in the options, some of the denominators involve terms like (d c - d·v). Oh right, I think when the charge is moving, the expressions for the potentials involve the velocity to account for the motion. So the denominator might be (d c - v·d), or something like that.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the scalar potential V is q/(4πε₀ (d c - (d · v)/c)), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be (d c + (d · v)) in the denominator.

Wait, let me get this straight. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by the same formula as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at time tr. But because the charge is moving, the potentials have a correction term due to the motion.

But thinking more carefully, the scalar potential of a moving charge is still given by (q)/(4πε₀ r'), but r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time. But in the options, the denominator is something like (d c - (d · v)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - r'.

Wait, the denominator in the options has terms like (d c - (d · v)). Let me think about units. The denominator should have units of length, so each term in the denominator must have
