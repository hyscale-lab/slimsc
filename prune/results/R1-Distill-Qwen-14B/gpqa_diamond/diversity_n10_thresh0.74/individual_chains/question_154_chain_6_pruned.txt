Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the chemist found an unnamed bottle with a white solid. He gathered some spectral data to identify it. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to determine which one fits the data.

First, let's list out all the information given.

Mass Spec: Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, I remember that molecular ion peaks are usually the highest, but sometimes isotopic peaks appear. Chlorine has a high abundance isotope (Cl-35 and Cl-37), so if the molecular formula includes Cl, we might see peaks at m/z differing by 2.

IR: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a pretty broad region, sounds like it could be an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but the broadness sometimes indicates hydrogen bonding. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1700s are usually carbonyl groups. So 1720 could be a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm^-1), or maybe an ester, or a ketone. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually broad. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, the carbonyl is higher, but that's less likely here because the options don't have that.

1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) - That's a very downfield shift. I'm thinking that's an O-H proton. Maybe from a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 ppm is more like a carboxylic acid â€“ the -OH proton.

Then, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a aromatic ring with two substituents. Wait, the pattern is two doublets, each with 2H. So probably para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with two H. For example, in para-disubstituted benzene, each H is next to substituents which cause splitting.

So putting this together:

- The molecule is a benzoic acid or similar, since the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (the -OH of the acid), and the aromatic protons are para-substituted.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. Wait, but the NMR shows an -OH at 11 ppm, which would be a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. Also, benzaldehyde would have the aldehyde proton around 10 ppm, but here it's 11.0, which is more like a COOH. Also, the IR would show a strong peak around 1720. If it's an aldehyde, the IR would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 (stretching for CHO), but the question's IR doesn't mention that. So probably not an aldehyde.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on the para position of a benzoic acid. So the COOH would give the O-H peak, which matches the NMR. The aromatic protons would be in a para substitution. Let's see, the substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions. Wait, wait, benzoic acid has the COOH on the benzene ring. So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl in the para position relative to the COOH. That would mean that the ring has two substituents: Cl and COOH, on opposite positions.

Wait, but the NMR shows 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each 2H. So in a para-substituted benzene, if there's a substituent in para, the neighboring protons would be meta, but wait, wait. Let me think. For benzoic acid, the ring is substituted with COOH. If another substituent (Cl) is para to the COOH, then the ring would have two substituents: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.

In this case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH). Wait, no. Wait, the benzene ring is symmetric. If COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 4, then the ring positions 2,3,5,6 are all either ortho or meta. Wait, but if you have two substituents, para to each other, then the ring's protons will be in two sets: two protons adjacent to COOH (ortho), and two protons adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH), but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring has two substituents in such a way that the remaining protons are in two sets of two. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, each substituent is Cl, and the protons are all equivalent. But that's only when substituents are same. However, here, the substituents are Cl and COOH, which are different. So the ring would have symmetry. Let's think: in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Similarly, protons at positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

So the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent (due to symmetry) and the same for 3 and 5. Each set
