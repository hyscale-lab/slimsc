Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, but the main focus seems to be on tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, right? Like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, for that to happen, the molecule must have adjacent carbonyl groups or something that allows such a shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, more precisely, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups (O) in the para positions, maybe? So, structure like O=C6H4=O. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups in adjacent positions? Or wait, maybe it's para, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, benzene with two ketone groups, but that's not possible because benzene is already a six-membered ring. Wait, maybe benzoquinone is a cyclic structure, like a cyclohexadienedione. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, but they're in the same ring. So, for example, 1,4-benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, structure is O=C6H4=O, but the positions are 1 and 4.

Now, can this undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is part of a ring. If the carbonyl groups are conjugated, perhaps in a way that allows for enol tautomerism. Wait, but benzoquinone is a di-ketone. So, maybe it's similar to 1,4-diketones which can undergo enolization. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's not possible because the carbonyl groups are on the ring, which might not allow for the necessary shift.

Then, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, it's a symmetrical molecule. Each carbonyl is separated by a CH2 group. So, for tautomerism to occur, there must be a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. In this case, each ketone is attached to two CH2 groups, right? So, each carbonyl is at position 1, 3, 5. So, each is between two CH2 groups. So each carbonyl is next to a CH2 which has Hs. So, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- in the ring. Wait, but actually, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is connected to two CH2 groups. So, for tautomerism, perhaps it's possible. Wait, but wait, tautomerism requires the possibility of moving a hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl to another position. But in the case of 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is flanked by two CH2 groups. So, perhaps each CH2 has Hs that could be involved in enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Tautomerism typically occurs in molecules with adjacent carbonyl groups or in conjugated systems. Alternatively, in situations where a hydrogen is alpha to a carbonyl group. In 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is flanked by CH2 groups, which have alpha hydrogens. So, perhaps this molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, benzoquinone, if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are opposite each other. So, would that structure allow for enol formation? Because the two carbonyl groups are not adjacent, but across the ring, maybe they can't form an enol. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because of its structure. Let me think. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that can shift. In a dienone like 1,4-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are separated by two carbons each. So, the carbonyls are on the benzene ring, which is conjugated. Wait, but perhaps the molecule is similar to a diketone. Wait, I think that para-diketones (like 1,4-cyclohexanedione) can undergo enolization. Wait, but benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone, which is a cyclohexadienedione? No, wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, with two ketones. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but in the 1,4 positions.

In such a structure, each carbonyl is connected to the benzene ring, which is conjugated. So, maybe each carbonyl has adjacent Hs (like in the ring), but wait, the ring is conjugated but perhaps not enough for enol tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is more like a quinone, which is a conjugated diketone. Quinones are known for their conjugated system, but do they undergo tautomerism? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps they don't, because the adjacent positions are part of the aromatic ring and not CH2 groups. So, maybe the carbonyls are in positions where the adjacent carbons are not CH2, but rather part of the ring, which doesn't have Hs in the right position for enol tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each at the 1,3,5 positions. So, each ketone is connected to two CH2 groups. So, each of those CH2 groups has two Hs. So, these Hs are alpha to the carbonyl groups, making them potentially involved in keto-enol tautomerism. So, maybe trione can undergo tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot.

Wait, but wait. If a molecule has multiple carbonyl groups, like 1,3,5-trione, perhaps the possibility of tautomerism is higher because there are more sites where enolization can occur. So, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, while benzoquinone can't. So, the compound that does not show tautomerism would be benzoquinone. So, for part A, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that's adjacent to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are in positions where the adjacent carbons are part of the benzene ring. Benzene is a planar structure, so the adjacent carbons are sp² hybridized. So, in that case, the adjacent carbons are not CH₂ groups but part of the ring. So, those are not CH₂ groups, so they don't have Hs attached. Wait, wait, no. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So, each ketone is attached to the benzene ring. The positions are 1 and 4 on the ring. So, each ketone is at a para position, connected to the ring.

So, each ketone is attached to a carbon that is part of the benzene ring. So, the adjacent carbons are in the ring, which are connected by double bonds. So, the adjacent carbons to the ketone are not CH₂ but part of the aromatic ring. Thus, they don't have Hs attached. So, in that case, there are no alpha hydrogens available for enol tautomerism. Because enol tautomerism requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. So, if the carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon that's sp² hybridized, then there are no Hs on that carbon. So, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl is attached to a sp² carbon, which doesn't have any Hs. So, no alpha hydrogens, so no tautomerism possible. So, benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has each ketone attached to a CH₂ group. So, for each carbonyl, the adjacent carbons are CH₂ groups, which have Hs. So, each of those CH₂ groups has Hs that are alpha to the carbonyl. So, that would allow for enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

Therefore, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, for part A, A is benzoquinone. So, among the options, the first part of the answer is A = benzoquinone.

Part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (or multiple chiral centers) leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds with internal planes of symmetry might not exhibit optical isomerism despite having stereocenters.

Let me think about each compound.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no, wait: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. Its ester would be CH3CHOHCOOCH3. So, the structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The hydroxy group is on the second carbon (the middle carbon). The structure would be:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH-CH3?

Wait, no, let me get the structure correct. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. But when it's the ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Looking at the carbon chain: the carboxylic acid is on the third carbon, the hydroxyl on the second, and methyl on the first. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to four different groups: one CH3, one OH, one COOCH3, and one H? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is:

- attached to a CH3 group (from the first carbon),
- an OH group,
- a COOCH3 group (from the third carbon),
- and the rest is a hydrogen? Wait, no, because the chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second carbon. So, the groups attached are:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- and another H? Or is it connected to another CH2?

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out more clearly. The molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)- 
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So, carbon 2 is attached to:

- carbon 1 (CH3),
- carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- an OH group,
- and a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

So, carbon 2 has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Thus, it's a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When both -OH groups are replaced by methyl esters, it becomes CH2COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. When both are esterified with methanol, you get MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH-CH2(COOCH3)?

Wait, no. Fumaric acid structure: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when you esterify both -COOH groups with methanol, you get the dimethyl ester: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So, the structure is OMeOOC-CH=CH-OOCMe.

Now, the question is whether this compound can exhibit optical isomerism. Fumaric acid (or its ester) is a diastereomer. Because the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the groups on either side are the COOCH3 groups. Wait, but in the case of fumaric acid, the double bond is between the two central carbons. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3? No, wait. No, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, no, wait. Fumarate is an unsaturated acid. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, that's succinic acid. Fumarate has a double bond. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

Wait, that's the structure. So, the molecule is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=CH
|
O-C-OCH3
O

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, no. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, as the dimethyl ester, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

So, the molecule has a double bond between the two middle carbons, each attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is:

O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3? No, no, it's a double bond: O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3.

So, the molecule is a trans-diepoxy structure? Or wait, what's the geometry? Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, but I think in this case, the ester is dimethyl fumarate, which is the same as fumaric acid but as an ester. So, the double bond is trans.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs at least one chiral center. Alternatively, some other forms of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism, but that doesn't lead to optical activity. So, whether the molecule can have enantiomers.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate: the molecule has a central double bond, with each end connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)OCH3? No, no double bond. Wait, no, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the two CH groups are on either side of the double bond.

Wait, each of those CH groups is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So, the question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Hmm, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical. Because each of the two ends are mirror images. The molecule is symmetric along the central double bond. So, for each substituent on one end, there's a corresponding substituent on the other. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which means it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Suppose I have a double bond with substituents on each end. If the substituents are the same on both sides, the molecule may be symmetric. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, each substituent on the double bond is a COOCH3 group. So, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are identical. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. So, part B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Could dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? No, because the molecule is symmetric. The two substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, so each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and another group). Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two Hs? Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group. So, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group? No.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me number the carbons. The molecule is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, it's a double bond. So, it's:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would be succinic acid's dimethyl ester, which is a saturated molecule. But fumarate is unsaturated. So, it's:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Each of the two CH groups attached to the double bond has one COOCH3 group and one H. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to COOCH3, H, and two other carbons. Wait, no. Each CH is attached to COOCH3, another CH, and two H's? Or is it that each CH is attached to COOCH3, and another CH with a double bond? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, putting it together:

For part A, the compound without tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A is benzoquinone.

For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option D says A is benzoquinone and B is dimethyl fumarate. But we determined that B should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B says A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, option B is correct for A and B.

Wait, looking again:

The options are:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, our conclusion is A is benzoquinone (so options B and D are possible for A), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so options A and B are possible for B). So, the correct option is B, where A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
- **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups in the para positions of a benzene ring. Tautomerism requires alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group) to shift between carbonyl and enol forms. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic ring and are sp² hybridized, meaning they do not have alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 of a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is flanked by CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These hydrogens can participate in keto-enol tautomerism, allowing the compound to undergo tautomerism.

Conclusion: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.
- **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (COOCH₃) on both ends of the double bond. This symmetry prevents the molecule from having a chiral center, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Conclusion: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- **A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.
- **B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

The correct option is **B**.

Answer: B
