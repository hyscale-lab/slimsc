Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about the decay of a specific state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. I think in the standard notation, that's |n, l, m⟩. So n=3, l=0 (which means it's an s-orbital), and m=0. The state decays to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. 

Wait, the question says it's a two-step dipole transition. So the electron can't go directly from n=3 to n=1 in one step because dipole transitions have selection rules. I remember that for dipole transitions, the change in n (Δn) can't be more than ±1, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no—the selection rules for hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But for the principal quantum number n, the selection rule is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but that's for the electric dipole transitions. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me think again.

In the case of electric dipole transitions, the selection rule for n is that the electron can transition between any two energy levels, but the transition's probability is zero unless certain conditions are met. The main selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, and also, for hydrogen-like atoms, the n doesn't have a strict selection rule like Δn = ±1, but the transition depends on the integrals of the atomic orbitals. But in practice, transitions between higher to lower states usually involve multiple steps if the change in n is by more than one.

Wait, so the initial state is 3s (n=3, l=0), and it decays to 1s (n=1, l=0). But a direct transition from 3s to 1s isn't allowed by the dipole selection rules because l has to change by ±1. So the electron can't go from l=0 to l=0 in a single dipole transition. So the decay must happen in two steps.

So
