Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's going on. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, alright, so first I need to figure out what each step does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. When heated with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, it would likely eliminate to form a double bond. Since there are two bromines, maybe it forms a diene? Or perhaps it forms a single double bond. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so it's probably an E2 elimination, leading to the formation of an alkene. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with KOH, right? So the product would be a conjugated diene, maybe something like 1,3-adamantadiene. So product 1 is likely an adamantine diene.

The IR spectrum shows an absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is formed with KOH, which is a base. Oh, wait, maybe it's not an elimination but a substitution. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane in KOH—maybe it's a double SN2 reaction? But adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some other reaction. Hmm, but the NMR data might help.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.2
