Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's try to break it down. The question gives me an unknown organic compound's 1H NMR data, and I need to choose between four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I should recall what these compounds look like. All of them are esters, right? Acetate esters. The substituents are either propenyl or butenyl groups, which are alkenes. The cis and trans refer to the configuration of the double bond.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2=CH-? No, wait. Propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. But wait, propenyl is three carbons, with a double bond. So, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, or similar, but wait, the ester is usually OAc-O-R, so the R group is the propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structure. The four options are:

Cis-propenyl acetate: the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in a cis configuration. Wait, actually, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but the substituents on the double bond would be the same on both carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should write the structures.

Cis-propenyl acetate would have the structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Oh wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or wait, the acetate is OAc-O-R, and R is the propenyl group.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ester structure. The acetate group is OAc-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2CH2=CHCH2, depending on where the double bond is. Wait, but the butenyl group could be either 1-propenyl or 2-propenyl, but I'm not sure. Wait, wait, butenyl groups have four carbons with a double bond. So 1-butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, and 2-butenyl would be CH2CH2=CHCH2? Or maybe CH3CH2CH=CH2, but that's substituting on the end. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (for propenyl) or between 2 and 3 (for butenyl). So, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (if the double bond is between 1 and 2) or CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that doesn't seem right). Wait
