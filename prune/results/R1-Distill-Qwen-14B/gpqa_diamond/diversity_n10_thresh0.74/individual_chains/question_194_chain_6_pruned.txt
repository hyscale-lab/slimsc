Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me think it through. 

The setup is that there are three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 each being ±1.

First, I should figure out all the possible states and their corresponding energies. Since each spin has two possible states, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states.

Let me list all possible states and compute E for each.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. The energy expression E is symmetric in all three pairs. So perhaps I can categorize the states based on how many pairs are aligned (i.e., S_i S_j = +1) or anti-aligned (S_i S_j = -1).

Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, -1 if different. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from 3 (all same) down to -3 (all opposite), but wait, actually, let's compute all possible values.

Wait, each term is +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let me check:

If all three spins are the same, say all +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

If two spins are same, and one different. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J
