Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. I need to find out at what gamma-ray energy their lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean lifetime can be affected by processes like pair production. For gamma-rays, the annihilation reaction is γγ → e+ e-. So, the higher energy the gamma-ray, the more likely it is to interact with CMB photons, right?

The problem gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 1e-3 eV. I think the CMB is a blackbody radiation, so the average photon energy is something like 2.7 K, but that's the temperature part. Oh wait, the average energy given here is 1e-3 eV, so maybe that's the typical photon energy we can use.

I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs depends on the energy of the photons involved. The cross-section increases as the photon energy increases. But how exactly?

The process is γ + γ → e+ + e-. The threshold energy for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so each pair has a rest mass of about 1.022 MeV. Wait, no, wait, each electron is 0.511 MeV, so two would make 1.022 MeV total. But since in the center-of-momentum frame, the sum of the energies of the two photons needs to be at least the rest mass of the pair. So the threshold condition is when the product of the photon energies is at least (m_e c²)² / 4. Because when both photons have the same energy, E = E1 = E2, so E² ≥ (m_e c²)² /4, so E ≥ m_e c² / 2.

Wait, let me get that right. For two photons colliding, the condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 /4, assuming they have opposite directions. So if the CMB photon has energy E_cmbr = 1e-3 eV, and the gamma-ray has energy E_gamma, then the condition for the reaction to happen is E_gamma * E_cmbr >= (m_e c²)^2 /4.

Wait, but that's the threshold condition. So for the reaction to occur, the product of their energies should be at least (m_e c^2)^2 /4. Let me compute m_e c^2 in eV. m_e is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². Divided by 4, that's approx (0.261) * 1e12 eV², so 2.61e11 eV².

So the condition is E_gamma * E_cmbr >= 2.61e11 eV²
