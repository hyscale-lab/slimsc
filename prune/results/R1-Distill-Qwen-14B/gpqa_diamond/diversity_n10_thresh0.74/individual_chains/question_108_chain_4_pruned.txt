Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The question gives me a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small m values, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can be 0, ±1, etc., depending on the orbital angular momentum.

The problem is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, I think. The energy of that transition is probably the ΔE they're referring to.

So, the paramagnetic term is the energy due to the magnetic interaction. I remember that the magnetic potential energy for a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is given by U = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * L, where L is the angular momentum. But wait, I think there's a factor involving the magnetic quantum number m. Alternatively, another formula I remember is μ = g * μ_B * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh, right, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), which is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T.

So the energy term H would be the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. Since B is parallel to Oz, and the magnetic moment for orbital angular momentum is along L, so the dot product is just μ_z * B. So H = μ_B * m * B. Because μ_z is μ_B * m.

Wait, actually, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = μ·B = μ_z B, which is (μ_B m) * B. So ⟨H⟩ would be μ_B m B. But wait, m can be 0, ±1, etc. So the expectation value of H is μ_B m B.

But wait, the question says small m. So, perhaps m is of order 1, like m=1. So ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to μ_B * m * B.

Now, what's the transition energy ΔE? The hydrogen atom's transition with wavelength 0.4861 μm corresponds to a specific energy difference. Let's calculate that. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². The Balmer series is transitions from n > 2 to n=2. The H-alpha line is the transition from n=3 to n=2.

So calculating ΔE for n=3 to n=2.

E3 = -13.6 / 9 ≈ -1.511 eV.
E2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.
ΔE = E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy differences are positive in magnitude, ΔE ≈ 1.889 eV.

Wait, that's the energy difference in electron volts. Let me convert that into joules because the paramagnetic term is in joules.

1 eV = 1.602×10^-19 J. So 1.889 eV is approximately 3.023×10^-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is μ_B * m * B. B is 1 T. μ_B is about 9.274×10^-24 J/T. So ⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.274e-24 * m * 1. Let's say m is 1, so it's about 9.274e-24 J.

Comparing the two: ⟨H⟩ is ~9.27e-24 J, and ΔE is ~3.02e-19 J. So ΔE is much larger than ⟨H⟩.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term versus the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is << ΔE.

So when they say compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with ΔE, which is the energy difference, the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Looking at the options, option C says ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE, which is correct. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think about it: the magnetic field here is 1 T, which is a strong field, but for hydrogen's energy levels, the primary energy differences are on the order of eV, which is much larger than
