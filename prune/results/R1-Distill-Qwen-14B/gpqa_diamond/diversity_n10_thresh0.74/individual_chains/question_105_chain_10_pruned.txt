Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is about 1 R_sun, but since the actual value might not matter as much as the ratio, I can keep that in mind. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Oh wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of half the star's surface is covered in spots.

The spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K different. So I think the spots are cooler, so T_spot would be 5000 K.

But wait, when a star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip. If the star were entirely unspotted, a planet transiting in front would block some light. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

Wait, the problem says that the photometric time-series observations show variations due to rotational modulation (so the spots rotating into and out of view). The amplitude of this variation is the same as what a planet would cause. So we need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

So how do I calculate the brightness variation due to the spots? The key is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are facing us versus when they're not.

First, the star's total flux without spots: Let's compute the total flux of the star. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

But when some of the surface is covered by spots with a lower temperature, the total flux will decrease. The filling factor, f, is the fraction of the surface (in this case, half the star's surface) covered by spots. So the effective flux would be the original flux minus the flux lost due to the spots.

Wait, maybe better to compute the change in flux as the star rotates. The spots are on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the area blocked (or the cooler spots) come into
