Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. The question is about a specific transition from the 3,0,0 state to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, dipole transitions are allowed when the change in the angular momentum (l) is ±1. So, the selection rule for l is Δl = ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1. But wait, for an electric dipole transition, the change in m is usually +/-1 or 0, but sometimes if the orbital is changing, other changes are possible.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. Since the initial l is 0 (s orbital) and the final l is 0 again, if it's a single transition, that wouldn't be allowed because Δl would be 0, not ±1. But the question says it decays via two dipole transitions. Oh, right, so it goes through two steps: first, a transition from n=3 to some intermediate state, and then another transition from that state to the final state.

So the first transition would have to change the angular momentum. Let's think about possible intermediate states. The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So in the first step,
