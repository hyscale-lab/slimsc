Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a given matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay is c * S. So I can write Ay as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues for angular momentum operators are usually quantized in units of ħ/2 or something. But let me think about the matrix.

Wait, wait, no. I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues. Let's calculate the eigenvalues of Ay.

The general approach for finding eigenvalues is to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0.

So, substituting Ay, that's (h/(4π)) * S - aI. Let me write it out:

Matrix Ay - a I:
[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a, (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*(i), (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which simplifies to:
[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)^2 - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * (i h)/(4π) ) ]

Calculating the determinant:

det = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) h² ) / ( (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So:

det = a² - [ ( 1 * h² ) / (16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So the equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Hmm, so the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any statement about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts must be wrong.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, but wait, 2πh is a big number, but our eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But our eigenvalues are h/(4π) times something. Wait, h is Planck's constant. Wait, but wait, in terms of angular momentum units, ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/(2). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Oh wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So if Ay has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

But let me compute h/(4π). Let me see, h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. 4π is about 12.566. So h/(4π) is approximately 5.28e-34 / (2π) ≈ 8.41e-35? Never mind the actual value; the key is that the eigenvalues are real, so options B, A are out.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, [A^2, Ay] should commute. So, the eigenfunctions of Ay should also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Because A^2 is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with each component.

But what about Az? Well, [Ay, Az] equals iħ A something else? Wait, in angular momentum algebra, [A_i, A_j] = iħ ε_ijk A_k. So [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x. So they don't commute. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az. So C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. So that makes sense.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure about that. Wait, the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors should form a basis. But the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not exactly sure about that wording. Maybe it's correct, but let me think about the other options.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So in the process of finding eigenvalues, which statement applies.

So let's re-examine the options:

Option C is about whether eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az. Since A^2 commutes with Ay, then yes, the same functions are eigenfunctions of both. So C is correct in that aspect. So if the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation (i.e., which statement is true), then option C is correct.

Wait, but the problem is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So when you calculate the eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not of Az. So C is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the actual computation. Since A² is the Casimir operator, its eigenvalues are the same for all components, so any eigenstate of Ay will automatically be an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part, about not being eigenfunctions of Az, is also correct because [Ay, Az] doesn't vanish. So yes, C's statement is correct.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), we have:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} 
-a & \frac{-i h}{4\pi} \\ 
\frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)^2 - \left(\frac{-i h}{4\pi}\right)\left(\frac{i h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplifying, \( (-i)(i) = 1 \), so:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \frac{h^2}{(4\pi)^2}.
\]

Setting \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \), we solve:

\[
a^2 = \frac{h^2}{(4\pi)^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. Any statement claiming the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Options
- **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, with no imaginary parts.

- **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \) (as \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator), meaning eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not necessarily eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

- **Option D**: Claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, this statement is less precise and does not directly address the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \) during the calculation.
