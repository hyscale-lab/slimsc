Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. The state provided is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with components 3i and 4. Let me write that down as a vector:

|ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]

Or in bra-ket notation, it's 3i |0⟩ + 4 |1⟩, assuming the basis states are |0⟩ and |1⟩. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the basis here. Oh well, moving on.

The expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. For the spin along y, the operator is S_y, which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Right, because the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices.

The sigma_y matrix given is:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ψ† (S_y) ψ. Let me write out the components.

Wait, more accurately, in matrix form, the expectation value is ψ† (S_y) ψ. So, let's break it down.

First, the state is a column vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T. The conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3, 4i ].

So, S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. Let me compute this matrix.

Let me compute the product step by step. So, the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Breaking it down:

ψ† = [ -3, 4i ]

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Multiplying ψ† with S_y:

ψ† S_y = (ħ/2) [ -3, 4i ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, matrix multiplication. Let's compute that.

The first element of the resulting row vector would be (-3)(0
