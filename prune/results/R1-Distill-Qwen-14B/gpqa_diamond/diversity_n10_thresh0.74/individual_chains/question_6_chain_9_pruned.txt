Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, so I'll take it slowly.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so that's a function of r and θ, which makes me think it's in polar coordinates. Since it's two-dimensional, we're dealing with a system where the particle's motion is in two dimensions, maybe like a plane or a polar plane.

I remember that when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates, especially for two-dimensional systems, it's helpful to separate the variables into radial and angular parts. So maybe I should try to express the potential in a way that separates r and θ terms.

Looking at the potential, V(r,θ) has two terms: (1/2)kr² is the first, which is just a function of r. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. I think cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me write that down:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]

Let me compute that. The second term becomes (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So expanding:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4. So,

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. So the potential separates into a purely radial term and an angular term involving cos2θ.

Now, in quantum mechanics, when the potential is separable into radial and angular parts, the Schrödinger equation can be solved by separating variables. So I should write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates and see how this potential affects it.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions (since it's polar coordinates for 2D) is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (1/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Wait, because in 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ². So the kinetic energy term is (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) + (1/(r²)) (∂²ψ/∂θ²) ].

So the equation becomes:

(ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r)) + (1/r² ∂²ψ/∂θ²) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E
