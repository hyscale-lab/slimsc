Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the masses will affect the composition directly. The question is about the elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. 

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere's compositions are given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7.5 -12 = same as Fe, wait no. Wait, the given is 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, let me double-check that. For the Sun:

For Fe: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, no, 10^-5 is 1e-5. Oh wait, 1e-5 is 0.00001.

So, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, what's [Si/Star_1] and
