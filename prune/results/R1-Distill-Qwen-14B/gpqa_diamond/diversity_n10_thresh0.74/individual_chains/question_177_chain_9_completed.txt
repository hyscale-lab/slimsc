Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. But wait, I remember that luminosity isn't directly dependent on mass, but more on radius and temperature. Hmm.

Oh, right, the question mentions that through spectroscopy, they found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think this relates to the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Oh wait, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. So T1 = T2.

Then, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Radial velocity is about how fast they're moving towards or away from us. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; away, redshifted. But wait, radial velocity here is given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, is that a radial velocity towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it doesn't matter for this specific problem since we're talking about their own rest frames for calculating luminosity, maybe. Or perhaps it affects the observed temperature?

Wait, no, because the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So I think that's the rest frame. Because Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving, its observed peak wavelength would be different. But the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same, meaning that perhaps the velocity has already been accounted for in determining their temperatures. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's just assume that the temperatures are the same because their peak wavelengths are same, regardless of velocity. Or perhaps the velocities are provided for another calculation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recap. The problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. So that implies that in their observed frame, the peak wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (positive or negative velocity), the observed wavelength would shift, right? But the problem states that the observed peak is the same. So perhaps the velocities are such that the Doppler shift corrects for any differences. But I'm not sure if that's needed here. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are redshift or blueshift, so that their temperatures in their rest frames are different, but the observed peak is same. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So their luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since we're assuming they're black bodies, that should be the case.

But wait, if the observed peak wavelengths are the same, that would mean that the observed temperatures are the same, right? Because Wien's law λ_max = b / T. So if their observed λ_max are the same, then their observed temperatures (T_observed) would be the same.

But wait, the actual temperature of the star is T_rest, and the observed temperature would be T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ) or something like that. Wait, no, the Doppler effect for radiation is a bit different. The formula for the observed wavelength when there's a radial velocity is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), assuming non-relativistic speeds. Or wait, maybe it's λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), but that's only for small velocities. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, considering relativistic Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative towards). So if a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, shorter (blueshifted).

In this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, λ_1_obs = λ_2_obs. But each star has its own rest frame λ_max.

So, let me denote T1_rest as the actual temperature of Star_1, and T2_rest as the actual temperature of Star_2.

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, the observed wavelength is the same as the rest wavelength. So λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1_rest.

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume that it's moving away (v is positive). So the observed wavelength is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we can set:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1_rest = b / T1_rest, and λ2_rest = b / T2_rest.

So substituting:

b / T1_rest = (b / T2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1_rest = (1/T2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Hmm, but I think I might have mixed up the Doppler formula. Let me get that right. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away). So the observed temperature would be T_obs = T_em * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). Because T is inversely proportional to λ, so if λ_obs is larger, T_obs is smaller.

Wait, no, let me think again. If a star is moving away, λ_obs is longer (redshifted), so the observed temperature would be lower. Using Wien's law, T_obs = b / λ_obs, so T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), assuming v is positive (moving away).

So for Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But since both stars have the same observed λ_max, their observed temperatures are the same: T1_obs = T2_obs.

So T1_rest = T2_obs * [ sqrt( (1 + v/c )/(1 - v/c) ) ]

Wait, no, because T_obs for Star_1 is T1_rest, since its velocity is zero. And T_obs for Star_2 is T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So T1_rest = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So the temperatures of the stars are related by that factor.

Wait, but the problem says that their observed λ_max are the same. So T1_obs = T2_obs = T_obs.

But T1_rest = T_obs, because Star_1 is not moving, so its observed temperature is same as its rest temperature.

For Star_2, T_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Setting T1_rest = T_obs:

T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) = T1_rest.

But T1_rest is the same as T_obs, which is same as T2_obs.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of observed temperatures being the same. So T1_obs = T2_obs.

T1_obs = T1_rest (since Star_1's velocity is zero)

T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Therefore,

T1_rest = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But wait, the problem says that the stars are observed to have same λ_max, which implies same T_obs, so T1_rest = T2_obs.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try writing the equations more clearly.

For Star_1: Since v1 = 0,

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1_rest.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v is positive.

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ2_rest = b / T2_rest.

So,

λ2_obs = (b / T2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But we know that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So:

b / T1_rest = (b / T2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1 / T1_rest = (1 / T2_rest) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Rearranged:

T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Wait, but that's the same as:

T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 - (v/c)) / (1 + (v/c)) )

So, T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

So, that gives the relationship between T2_rest and T1_rest.

Now, the problem is about their luminosity. Luminosity is given by L = 4 π R² σ T⁴. So, L1 = 4 π (R1)^2 σ T1_rest^4

Similarly, L2 = 4 π (R2)^2 σ T2_rest^4

We are to find the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2² ) * ( T1^4 / T2^4 )

= (2.25) * ( T1 / T2 )^4

But from earlier, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

= sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = ( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )^2

So, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ]^2

Now, let's compute β. The velocity v is 700 km/s. Let's compute β = v/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So, v = 700 km/s → β = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.00233333...

So, β ≈ 0.002333.

Now, let's compute (1 + β) and (1 - β):

1 + β ≈ 1.002333

1 - β ≈ 0.997667

So, (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Compute numerator: 1.002333

Denominator: 0.997667

Compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me think about it. Let's approximate using binomial expansion since β is small.

(1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ (1 + β) (1 + β + β² + ... ) ≈ 1 + 2β + 2β² + ... But for small β, it's approximately 1 + 2β.

So,

(1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1 + 2β.

Since β is 0.002333, 2β is about 0.004666.

So 1 + 2β ≈ 1.004666.

So, (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.004666.

So, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ (1.004666)^2 ≈ approximately 1.00934.

Wait, 1.004666 squared is about 1.009333, because (1 + x)^2 ≈ 1 + 2x when x is small.

So, 2x here is 2 * 0.004666 ≈ 0.009332.

So, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ 1.009332.

So, putting it back into the luminosity ratio:

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009332 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 1.009332.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009332 ≈ approx 0.020997.

So total ≈ 2.25 + 0.020997 ≈ 2.270997.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the earlier calculation of (1 + β)/(1 - β) is about 1.004666, so squared is about 1.00934.

But perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Alternatively, using calculator-like approach:

Compute (700/3e5) = 700 / 300000 = 0.00233333...

So β = 0.00233333.

1 + β = 1.00233333.

1 - β = 0.99766667.

Compute (1.00233333) / (0.99766667) = let's compute numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, let's compute (1.00233333 / 0.99766667).

One way is to consider it as (1 + 0.00233333) / (1 - 0.00233333).

Which is approximately 1.00466666, as earlier.

So,

(1.00466666)^2 = (1 + 0.00466666)^2 = 1 + 2*0.00466666 + 0.00466666^2.

= 1 + 0.00933332 + (approx 0.00002178) ≈ 1.009355.

So, [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ 1.009355.

So, multiply by 2.25: 2.25 * 1.009355 ≈ 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.009355) = 2.25 + 0.02104 ≈ 2.27104.

So, approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Wait, 2.27 is close to 2.27, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when the star is moving, the observed temperature is lower if moving away. So, the actual temperature of Star_2 (T2_rest) is higher than the observed temperature. Because to have the same observed λ_max as Star_1, which isn't moving, Star_2 must have a higher temperature in its rest frame, but when observed, it's lower due to redshift.

Wait, but earlier I thought of T_obs as being same for both, but perhaps the correct approach is that T1_rest is the same as T_obs, since Star_1 has zero velocity. But for Star_2, the observed temperature is T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which can be rewritten as T2_rest = T2_obs * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But since T1_obs = T2_obs, then T1_rest = T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the actual calculation of luminosity is based on rest temperature. So, the luminosity formula uses T_rest, and that's why we need to account for T2_rest.

Wait, the problem says the stars are observed to have same λ_max, so their observed temperatures are the same. So T1_obs = T2_obs.

But T1_obs is T1_rest (since v1=0), so T1_rest = T2_obs.

But T2_obs is T2_rest scaled by the Doppler factor.

So, T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c. But since v is positive (moving away), this would make T2_obs less than T2_rest.

Wait, but in this setup, T1_rest = T2_obs.

So,

T2_rest = T1_rest / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which is T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, the ratio T2_rest / T1_rest is sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Now, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, R1² / R2² = (2.25) (since (1.5)^2 = 2.25)

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4

But T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) = sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2

Wait, no, because (T1 / T2) is sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), so when raised to the 4th power, it becomes ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

Wait, but wait, that would make (T1/T2)^4 = ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

Wait, but T2 is larger than T1 because Star_2's rest temperature is higher if it's moving away and observed to have lower temperature.

Wait, no, let me think again. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed temperature is lower. So T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, to have T2_obs = T1_rest, we have T1_rest = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, T2_rest = T1_rest / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ) = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T2_rest is higher than T1_rest.

So, T2_rest / T1_rest = sqrt( (1+β)/(1-β) )

So, T1 / T2 = T1_rest / T2_rest = 1 / sqrt( (1+β)/(1 - β) ) ) = sqrt( (1-β)/(1+β) )

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = ( (1-β)/(1+β) )^2

So, putting it into L1/L2:

2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2

Now, with β = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.0023333.

So,

(1 - β) ≈ 0.99766667

(1 + β) ≈ 1.00233333

So,

(1 - β)/(1 + β) ≈ 0.99766667 / 1.00233333 ≈ approximately 0.995333.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.99766667 divided by 1.00233333.

I can think of this as  (997666.67 / 1002333.33 ) ≈ let's compute that.

Approximately, 997666.67 / 1,002,333.33 ≈ 0.995333.

So,

( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2 ≈ (0.995333)^2 ≈ 0.990711.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990711 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.990711 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228 approximately.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275. So, approximately 2.228.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.228 is about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, that's close to option D.

But earlier, when I considered the Doppler shift for T2_rest as higher, I had a ratio of 2.27, but that was when I calculated (1 + β)/(1 - β ) to the power 2, which would lead to a higher value.

But wait, now I'm getting approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-express.

Wait, the correct approach is that L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

Because earlier, I think I might have mixed up the terms.

Wait, let's go back.

L1/L2 = 2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

Because,

(T1/T2)^4= ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

So,

L1 = 2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2 * L2.

So, the ratio L1/L2 is 2.25 * [(1 - β)/(1 + β)]^2.

So, plugging in the numbers.

Compute [(1 - β)/(1 + β)]^2:

β = 0.00233333.

1 - β = 0.99766667.

1 + β = 1.00233333.

So,

(0.99766667)/(1.00233333) = 0.995333.

Square that: 0.995333^2 ≈ 0.990711.

So,

2.25 * 0.990711 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the correct answer is option D.

But wait, why earlier when I thought of the Doppler shift, I considered (1 + β)/(1 - β) in a different way?

Ah, perhaps I confused which star's Doppler shift was being considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, which in turn affects the rest temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the observed luminosity depends on the observed temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the stars are radiating as blackbodies, and the luminosity is calculated assuming that. So, the observed wavelengths are the same, which gives the same observed temperatures. So for the purpose of calculating luminosity, it's using their actual (rest) temperatures.

Wait, no, because the observed temperature is T_obs = T_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, for Star_2, its observed T is lower than its actual T_rest.

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is same for both stars, which implies that T_obs is same for both. So for Star_1, T1_rest = T_obs.

For Star_2, T2_obs = T_obs = T1_rest.

But T2_obs = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

T1_rest = T2_rest * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

=> T2_rest = T1_rest * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T2_rest is higher than T1_rest.

Then, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1_rest^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2_rest^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1_rest / T2_rest)^4.

Which is,

= (2.25) * (1 / sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ))^4.

Simplify:

= 2.25 * [ (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2 ].

So,

= 2.25 * ( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )^2.

Which is what I had earlier.

So the calculation gives about 2.228, which is option D (~2.23).

But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1 - β)/(1 + β):

(1 - 0.00233333)/(1 + 0.00233333) = (0.99766667)/(1.00233333)

Compute this division accurately.

0.99766667 / 1.00233333.

Let me compute this as:

= (0.99766667) * (1 / 1.00233333).

1 / 1.00233333 ≈ 0.997667.

So,

0.99766667 * 0.997667 ≈ approximately 0.99533.

Square that: 0.99533^2 = approximately 0.99071.

So,

2.25 * 0.99071 ≈ 2.228.

So, 2.228 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(L\) is the luminosity, \(R\) is the radius, and \(T\) is the temperature of the star. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the Temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{max}}\)) of both stars are the same. By Wien's law, the observed temperature (\(T_{\text{obs}}\)) is inversely proportional to \(\lambda_{\text{max}}\), so the observed temperatures of both stars are equal:

\[
T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{\text{obs,2}}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, its observed temperature equals its rest temperature:

\[
T_{\text{obs,1}} = T_{1,\text{rest}}
\]

For Star_2, its rest temperature (\(T_{2,\text{rest}}\)) is related to its observed temperature by the relativistic Doppler shift formula:

\[
T_{\text{obs,2}} = T_{2,\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

where \(\beta = v/c\) and \(v = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). Substituting \(\beta = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333\), we find:

\[
T_{2,\text{rest}} = T_{1,\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the rest temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

### Step 2: Substituting into the Luminosity Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio raised to the fourth power is:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(\beta = 0.002333\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta} = \frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.995333
\]

\[
\left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2 \approx (0.995333)^2 \approx 0.990711
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
