Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The steps are:

1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1.
2. Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate to form product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-16-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature to form product 3.

And the question is, how many carbon atoms are in product 3? The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. I'll try to visualize each reaction.

Starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is something like a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde has the double bond in the trans configuration. So the structure is benzene with a CH₂-CH₂-CHO group? No, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde is attached to a vinyl group. So it's benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group, but wait, no. Wait, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is actually a benzene ring with a propenal substituent. So, benzene-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is incorrect. Oh wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is benzene ring attached to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait, more accurately, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not right. Wait, I think the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is incorrect. No, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, no, correction: cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a vinyl group. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO?
