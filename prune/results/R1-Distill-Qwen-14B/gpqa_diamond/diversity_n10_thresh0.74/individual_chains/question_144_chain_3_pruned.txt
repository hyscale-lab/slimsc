Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The general idea is that the longer the lifetime, the further the particle can travel before decaying. But wait, how do I calculate that exactly?

I think I need to use the formula for the mean lifetime, which is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. Oh wait, but wait, no. Γ is the total decay width, and it's related to the lifetime. Because Γ is the energy width of the resonance, which is connected to the uncertainty in energy and thus the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Right, so the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the total decay width Γ. The formula should be τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should double-check the units. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, so I need to convert Γ into GeV to match the units.

Given Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems really small, but particles with short lifetimes decay quickly.

Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance is the product of the velocity of the particle and the lifetime. So, I need to find the velocity v of the meson.

To find v, I think I need to use the relativistic energy equation. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X =
