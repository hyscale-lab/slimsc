Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, with concentrations of 1e-2 M for Co and 0.1 M for SCN-. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16.

Wait, stability constants... Oh right, those are the formation constants for the complexes. So each beta represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. Like, beta1 is for Co(SCN)1^+ (since Co is +2 and SCN is -1, so one SCN would make the charge +1?), beta2 is for Co(SCN)_2^(0), beta3 is Co(SCN)_3^-, and beta4 is Co(SCN)_4^2-.

I think the first step is to write out all the possible complexes and their corresponding formation reactions. Well, the problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex, so that's the second one, beta2=40.

But I need to find the percentage of that complex relative to all possible cobalt species. So I should consider all the possible species: Co^2+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^{2-}. Each has a certain concentration based on the stability constants.

The total concentration of cobalt species [Co_total] is the sum of each individual complex's concentration. So [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}].

We can model this using the formation constants. The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the overall reaction.

Wait, but sometimes in such cases, people consider the overall stability constant for each complex, which is the product of the individual step constants. So, for the nth complex, the overall beta is beta1*beta2*...*betan. Wait, no, wait. Each beta is for adding one SCN- at a time. So the overall beta for the nth complex is the product of betas up to n. Or wait, no: for each complex, the formation is a stepwise process. So for Co(SCN)_2^0, the formation would involve first adding one SCN to Co^2+ to form CoSCN^+, then adding another SCN^- to that to form Co(SCN)_2^0. So the overall beta for Co(SCN)_2^0 would be beta1 * beta2.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for the second complex is beta2, which refers to the formation of the second complex from the first. Or is each beta_n the overall constant for the nth complex? Hmm, I
