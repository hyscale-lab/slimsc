Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions and gives some clues about the substances involved. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and point group theory, which is used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions as described:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds could be. Let's break it down.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Since B is used in high equivalence, perhaps it's a halogen or another diatomic gas. Maybe B is Cl2? Because I know chlorine gas is diatomic, and reactions with metals often involve multiple equivalents.

Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of B would form product C. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2. So, if A is something like aluminum, for example, but wait, aluminum reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions. But let me think more.

Wait, product C is bright red. I remember that some metal chlorides have colored compounds. For example, CoCl2 is blue but when it's CoCl2·6H2O, it's pink. Wait, but another thought: maybe C is a copper compound. Copper(II) chloride is blue, but maybe in another form. Wait, no, another possibility: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) chloride is green, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfur compound.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to give back A, and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So, the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G is weak, let's think of possible acids. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like acetic acid (CH3COOH) or HCN, but wait, maybe more likely something else.

If C is a chloride, then when it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze to give HCl and another acid. For example, if C is a metal chloride with a higher oxidation state. For instance, consider FeCl3. FeCl3 reacts with water to produce Fe(OH)3 and HCl. But wait, that's one acid. Hmm, but in the problem, two different acids are formed.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a mixed anhydride or a complex. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but that doesn't fit the earlier steps.

Wait, going back to reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B in 1:1 form H. If B is Cl2, then D could be something that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio. For example, if D is H2O, then H would be HClO (hypochlorous acid), but that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is NaOH? No, but then H would be NaClO. Wait, perhaps D is a base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2? But then reaction 4 would involve D and O2 forming a solvent. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, let me think again about reaction 4. Solvent H is formed by D and B in 1:1 ratio. Common solvents include H2O, ethanol, methanol, etc. So if B is Cl2, then
