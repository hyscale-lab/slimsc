Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Oh, right, I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. The general form for Yukawa interactions is something like L = -g ψ̄ ψ φ, where φ is the scalar field (boson), and g is the coupling constant. So in this case, X is the boson field, and the term is proportional to X(y). So the interaction is between the fermion field ψ_f and the boson X.

But wait, the term is written as -λ_f f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the v is the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field, so when X is the Higgs field, for example, the Higgs has a VEV, and the interaction term involves the fluctuation X around that VEV.

But for the purpose of decay, I think the important point is that the boson X couples to fermions through this interaction term. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So we need to find which fermions it can decay into at lowest order.

Wait, at lowest order, the decay would be tree level. So the boson X can decay into two fermions, say f and f̄, because the interaction term is ψ̄ X ψ, which suggests that the boson X can mediate the annihilation or creation of a fermion-antifermion pair.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the decay products must each have a mass less than 3 GeV each, because in a decay, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the parent particle. Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion would have energy E = (m_X + m_f)/(2), but since m_X
