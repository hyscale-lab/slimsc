Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm. Let's start by figuring out what each part could be.

First, the gas W: its molecule has equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. Common ones could be H2O, CO2, NH3, etc. Wait, but the molecule's neutron and proton counts must be equal. So for each molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Wait, each molecule. For example, if it's H2O: each molecule has 2 protons in H and 8 in O. Wait, no, wait, each molecule's total. Wait, no, the way the question is worded, I think it's that the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons. So H2O: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0 (assuming protium), O has 8 (since O is usually 16, which is 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So total neutrons: 2*0 + 8 = 8. That's not equal, so H2O doesn't fit.

What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) + 4*1 = 10. Neutrons: C has 6 (because C is 12), H has 0. So total neutrons: 6 + 0 = 6. Not equal to 10.

Wait, maybe CO2? Protons: C (6) + 2*8 (O) = 6 +16=22. Neutrons: C has 6,
