Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism happens when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbons, bonded to four different groups. So the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. Those would show optical activity, like in plane-polarized light.

The question lists four different compounds, and I need to figure out which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining different numbers. Let me go through each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Oh, this sounds complex. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, with nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Wait, but can biphenyls have stereoisomerism? Oh right, if the two rings are connected by a single bond, the molecule can have cis and trans arrangements, but those are geometric isomerism (stereoisomers), not optical. But wait, could there be a chiral center here? Let me think. The central carbon where the two rings connect? No, wait, in biphenyl, each ring is connected by a single bond, so the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, right? So the groups would be: two phenyl rings, an ester group from the carboxylate, and perhaps a nitro group? Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The central
