Okay, so I've got this question about calculating non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are like the "simple" quantum states, like coherent states, thermal states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are more complex, and cat states are definitely non-Gaussian because they're superpositions of coherent states.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Right, because the inner product of |alpha> and |-alpha> would involve exp(-2|alpha|²) since <alpha|-alpha> is exp(-|alpha|² - |alpha|²) = exp(-2 alpha²).

The non-Gaussianity here is calculated using relative entropy, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of our state and tau is a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, but relative entropy is usually a measure of how different two states are. Here, the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of a Gaussian state. Because if the state is Gaussian, they should have the same entropy, so del_b would be zero. For non-Gaussian states, it should be positive.

But wait, the question is about using relative entropy as the measure. Oh right, sometimes people use the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the state and the closest Gaussian state as a measure of non-Gaussianity.

But to calculate del_b, we need to know both rho and tau. Tau is a Gaussian state, but which one? I think the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the given state, because that's how you find the closest Gaussian state. So tau would be the Gaussian state with the same first moments <x>, <p>, and the same variance in position and momentum as rho.

Wait, for coherent states, which are Gaussian, the density matrix is already Gaussian. So if the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, then rho is non-Gaussian. But tau, the reference Gaussian state, would have the same expectation values for position and momentum as rho, but maybe with the same covariance matrix? Or perhaps the
