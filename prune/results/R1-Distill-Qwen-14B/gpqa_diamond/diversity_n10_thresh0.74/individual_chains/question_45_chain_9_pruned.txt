Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about four spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh wait, but wait, the particles are identical fermions, so their wavefunction has to be antisymmetric.

The setup is a 1D infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is written here as E multiplied by n². So E is the base energy unit, E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), right. So each particle's energy would be E times n squared, where n is the quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions. So the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles. The wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts. Since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin state can be either symmetric (triplet states) or antisymmetric (singlet state). Oh wait, but the spatial part must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, and vice versa.

But wait, because the particles are in the same spatial state, their spin states would have to be such that the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric. Wait, no, actually, each particle can't be in the same spatial state because of the Pauli exclusion principle. So each must have a unique spatial state, but wait, wait, no, wait: in a 1D well, each state is uniquely determined by n. So for four fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum number n is the only one, so each particle must have a different n. But wait, wait, no, because in 1D, each n is a separate state. So for four particles, we'll have four different n's.

Wait, but wait, for a one-dimensional infinite well, the quantum number n is a positive integer, so the lowest states are n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So for four fermions, each will occupy a different n, since they can't have the same n. So the ground state would be the four lowest possible n's, which are 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but wait, no, because each particle is spin-1/2, but in a 1D well, the spatial wavefunction for each particle is ψ_n(x), and the spin part can be symmetric or antisymmetric. Wait, but in the case where multiple particles are in the same spatial state, their spin state must be antisymmetric. But wait, wait, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for fermions, the complete quantum state must be unique. So for each particle, the quantum numbers include n and spin. But wait, in this problem, are we considering the spatial parts only, or including spin?

No, wait, the question states that the particles are spin-1/2, but the potential is 1D. So for each spatial state (n), there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins. Oh wait, that's a key point. So in a 1D well, each n can have two particles with spin up and down. So the Pauli exclusion principle allows two particles per spatial state, each with opposite spins.

Wait, but wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So yes, each n can hold two particles. So for the ground state, the lowest energies would have maximum occupancy in the lower n's.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible energy, which would mean filling the lowest possible n's with as many particles as possible. Let me think: each n can have two particles (spin up and down), so for four particles, we only need two different n's. Because n=1 can hold two particles, n=2 can hold the other two. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Because that uses the lowest possible energies.

Wait, but wait no. Because in the ground state, the particles will fill the lowest energy levels first, considering the Pauli principle. So for four particles, the lowest possible configuration is n=1 (two particles, spins up and down), n=2 (two particles, spins up and down). So the total energy would be the sum of each of their energies.

So each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1)^2 = E. There are two particles here, so 2E.

Each particle in n=2 has energy E*(2)^2 = 4E. Two particles, so 2*4E=8E.

Total energy for the ground state is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but that's the sum. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait,
