Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A and B.

First, I'll look at reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ at the end probably refers to some acidic workup.

So, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. In this case, the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me try to visualize this. The spiro atom is the 1-position, which is also where the vinyl group is attached. So, the molecule has a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring? Or wait, the spiro indices are 3 and 5, so the rings must be a 3-membered and a 5-membered? No, wait, I think the numbers in the spiro notation denote the number of atoms in each ring. So, spiro[3.5] would mean a three-membered and a five-membered ring connected by the spiro atom.

Wait, no, the notation is spiro[a.b], where a and b are the number of carbons in each ring. So, spiro[3.5]non... Well, the full name is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the non indicates nine carbons in total. Let's break it down. The spiro atom is the 1st carbon, which is the spiro connecting a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? No, wait, the spiro[3.5] would have a 3-membered and 5-membered ring. So, the 3-membered ring would have two other carbons besides the spiro atom, and the 5-membered ring would have four other carbons besides the spiro. So the total is 3 (spiro and two others) + 5 (spiro and four others) = 9, which matches the non part.

But wait, the structure also has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the spiro carbon. And a double bond at position 5. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure. The spiro is at position 1, so the 1st carbon is connected to the vinyl group, and also to two rings. One ring is a 3-membered (so carbons 1, 2, 3) and another is a 5-membered (carbons 1, 4,5,6,7), but wait, that might not add up. Alternatively, maybe the main chain is different. Alternatively, perhaps the 3.5 refers to the number of carbons in each ring, excluding the spiro.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the spiro as connecting two rings: a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a five-membered ring (like cyclopentane), but the rings share the spiro carbon. So, the molecule is a bicyclic compound where two rings are connected at one carbon.

But regardless, the reaction is with THF, KH, and H+. So, what does this
