Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again.

So, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state given by 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of sigma_z, which makes sense because sigma_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for these states.

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation value calculations. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the conjugate of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then multiplying by the state again. So ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

Wait, I think I can break this down into parts. Since expectation values are linear, the expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations. So, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make things easier.

First, I'll find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value should be straightforward. For any state, the expectation of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of |↓⟩. Because σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

Looking at the state ψ: the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. Wait, let me check that—0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. Oh wait, 0.25 plus 3/4 is 1, so that's a normalized state. Good.

So the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability for |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Okay, so ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly say the expectation like for σz. I need to compute it using the given state.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Wait, maybe I can express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Alternatively, I can calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let's expand this.

The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, let me write it as a vector. Let me represent |↑⟩ as a column vector [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0;1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, let's do the matrix multiplication.

First, compute σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute that:

σx * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, the conjugate transpose of ψ is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*]. Since the coefficients are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]
