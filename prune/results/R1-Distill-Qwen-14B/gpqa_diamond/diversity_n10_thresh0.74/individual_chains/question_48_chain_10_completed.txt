Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1. Wait, bromine... when a ketone reacts with Br2, what happens? Oh right, that's the haloform reaction. But wait, no, wait. The haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone reacts with excess bromine in the presence of a base, right? Cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone, so maybe it's something else.

Oh wait, maybe it's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. But I thought that's more for aldehydes or ketones. Let me think. When ketones react with bromine, maybe it's an addition reaction. Wait, does the carbonyl group add bromine? Or is it a different reaction?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha-bromination of carboxylic acids. No, that's not it. Alternatively, the reaction could be the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's not with Br2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, another point: When ketones react with bromine, sometimes it's the formation of a bromohydrin. Or maybe it's an enolate formation? Wait, but enolates require a base, like maybe in the presence of something else.

Wait, no, wait. When cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, maybe it's the bromination of the carbonyl oxygen. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, does bromine add to the carbonyl, making an oxide? Or perhaps it's a bromide substitution?

Wait, maybe the first step is a different reaction. Oh, wait! I think I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's bromine in a different condition. Wait, maybe the cyclohexanone is undergoing a ring-opening reaction with bromine.

Wait, another thought: Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. If you add bromine, perhaps it's undergoing a dihydroxylation, but that's with something like OsO4, not Br2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. Oh wait, so the alpha positions are the positions adjacent to the carbonyl. So, cyclohexanone has six carbons in the ring, with the carbonyl on one carbon. The carbons next to that (alpha) are two CH2 groups. So when the alpha hydrogen is abstracted, it can form an enolate, which could react with bromine.

But wait, if you have cyclohexanone and you add Br2, maybe it's a bromination at the alpha position. So product 1 would have a bromine substituent on the alpha carbon. Wait, but how does that happen? Because in the presence of a base, maybe the enolate is formed, which can then react with Br2. But the question says it's treated with bromine, so perhaps it's under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple addition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine under certain conditions, perhaps it's undergoing alpha bromination. So, the alpha carbons (the two adjacent CH2 groups) would get brominated. So product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone? Or perhaps 1-bromo-cyclohexanone? No, wait, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6 (in a cyclohexane ring) so after bromination, product 1 would have a Br on one of those positions.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is symmetric, so if both alpha positions are equivalent, then adding Br would give a single product. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but how is that done? Because for alpha bromination, you usually need a base, like in the presence of NaOH, to deprotonate the alpha hydrogen, forming the enolate, which then attacks the electrophilic bromine. But in this case, the reagent is just bromine, so perhaps it's an electrophilic substitution without a base. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a bromination via a radical mechanism, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the initial reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. In that case, the carbonyl becomes an oxide with two Br atoms added. So cyclohexanone would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone oxide. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different addition.

Wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe the product is cyclohexyl dibromide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. When cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), it could form a diepoxide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each reaction step does. Let me outline each step:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with bromine → product 1.

2. Product 1 heated with NaOH → product 2.

3. Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine → product 3.

4. Product 3 treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → product 4.

The question is about product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1.

Wait, another possibility: Could it be the formation of a bromocyclohexane? No, because cyclohexanone is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine adds to the carbonyl, making a bromide. Wait, the carbonyl oxygen is an electron-withdrawing group, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. So, perhaps Br- attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding across the double bond.

Wait, but the reaction of ketones with HBr typically leads to the formation of a secondary bromide. But in this case, the reagent is Br2, not HBr. So, perhaps it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the bromine is acting as an oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, maybe it's an example of the benzoin condensation, but that's with aldehydes. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromohydrin. For example, when a ketone reacts with a bromine in the presence of water, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let me think about what each step does and work forward.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with NaOH. So if product 1 is a brominated cyclohexanone, heating with NaOH might cause some elimination or ring-opening.

Wait, if product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone, then heating with NaOH would lead to elimination. Because in the presence of a base, the bromide could leave, and the carbonyl group could participate in an elimination reaction. But wait, the carbonyl is adjacent to the bromide.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. So, if product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone, heating with NaOH would cause the bromide to leave, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2, making cyclohexenone. But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring, so if you eliminate, you'd get cyclohexene with the carbonyl in position 1 and a double bond between 1 and 2.

Wait, no, wait. If product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone, then the structure is:

O
||
C1 - C2-Br
       \
        C3 - C4 - C5 - C6

So when NaOH is added, the bromide leaves, and the base deprotonates a beta hydrogen. Wait, but the carbonyl is at C1, and the Br is at C2. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, making cyclohexenone. So product 2 would be cyclohexenone.

But wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a di-substituted bromide, maybe the elimination would lead to a different structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a vicinal di-bromide. For example, adding Br2 to the carbonyl group, leading to a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane structure. But wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, step 2 would treat with NaOH, which might eliminate HBr, forming a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about step 3. Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3. Thionyl chloride typically converts carboxylic acids into acid chlorides, but product 2 would have to have a carbonyl group for that. So if product 2 is an aldehyde or ketone, treating it with SOCl2 would convert the carbonyl into a chlorinated compound. Wait, but in the presence of pyridine, SOCl2 reacts with alcohols or carboxylic acids, but if product 2 is a ketone, then perhaps it's converting the ketone into an acyl chloride.

Wait, but in step 2, if product 2 is cyclohexenone (a ketone), then product 3 would be the corresponding acyl chloride, cyclohexanoyl chloride.

Then, step 4 is treating product 3 with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)3). Wait, that's a strong reducing agent. It's usually used to reduce esters, amides, and maybe nitriles, but for acyl chlorides, does it do something else?

Wait, wait, LiAlH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce acyl chlorides to alcohols. So if product 3 is an acyl chloride, then product 4 would be the corresponding alcohol.

Wait, but wait: Let me think about the structure of product 4. If product 3 is cyclohexanoyl chloride, then product 4 would be cyclohexanol after reduction. But wait, wait, reduction of an acyl chloride would typically give the primary alcohol. So cyclohexanoyl chloride would reduce to cyclohexanol. But in that case, cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of cyclohexanoyl chloride is O=C(OCl)-cyclohexyl. So when reduced, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group, so the product would be cyclohexanol. Wait, no, wait. When you reduce an acyl chloride RCOCl, you get RCH2OH.

Wait, no: Wait, the carbonyl group (RCO-) would be reduced to RCH2O- then protonated to RCH2OH. So for cyclohexanoyl chloride, the product would be cyclohexylmethanol? No, wait. Cyclohexanoyl chloride is RCOCl where R is cyclohexyl. So reducing that would give RCH2-OH, which would make it cyclohexylmethanol, a primary alcohol.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make it clear:

R-COCl → R-CH2-OH after reduction.

But cyclohexanoyl chloride is O=C(OCl)-cyclohexane. So when reduced, the carbonyl becomes CH2-OH attached to the cyclohexane ring. So product 4 would be cyclohexylmethanol, which is a primary alcohol with the OH on the CH2 group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is cyclohexanone, which is a cyclic ketone. Let me retrace all the steps:

1. Cyclohexanone + Br2 → product 1. Let's say product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

2. Product 1 (2-bromo-cyclohexanone) heated with NaOH → elimination occurs, forming cyclohexenone.

3. Cyclohexenone (product 2) treated with SOCl2 and pyridine → cyclohexenoyl chloride.

4. Cyclohexenoyl chloride treated with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 → reduction to cyclohexenylmethanol? Or wait, LiAlH(t-Bu)3 is a strong reducing agent. Let me think: LiAlH4 reduces acid chlorides to primary alcohols. So cyclohexenoyl chloride would become cyclohexenylmethanol.

Wait, but wait. If product 3 is an acyl chloride, then product 4 is the corresponding alcohol. So if product 3 is (cyclohexenyl)COCl, then product 4 would be (cyclohexenyl)CH2OH.

Wait, but let me think about the structure again. If product 2 is cyclohexenone, then product 3 would be cyclohexenoyl chloride. So product 4 upon reduction would be cyclohexenylmethanol, which is a primary alcohol with a cyclohexenyl group attached.

Now, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

But wait, let me double-check the steps again.

Alternative approach: perhaps the initial bromine addition is a different reaction.

Another possibility for step 1: Maybe it's the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, making a bromoalkane. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is the formation of a dibromide. For example, if cyclohexanone adds Br2 across the carbonyl, making a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Then, step 2 is treatment with NaOH, which may cause elimination, forming cyclohexene.

Wait, let's imagine:

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Step 2: 1,2-dibromocyclohexane + NaOH → elimination to form cyclohexene and NaBr.

Wait, but wait, 1,2-dibromocyclohexane would require that two Br atoms are added to adjacent carbons. Then, in a NaOH solution, perhaps the two Brs could be eliminated, forming a double bond. So product 2 would be cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: cyclohexene is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine. Wait, but thionyl chloride is typically used to convert carboxylic acids or alcohols into chlorides. What about alkenes? Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe my previous steps are wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the initial steps wrong. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let me think about each step.

1. Cyclohexanone → treated with Br2.

Possibly, the reaction could be the formation of a bromide via some mechanism. I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I can find another way.

Let me see: The first product is 1. Then, 1 is heated with NaOH to form 2. Then 2 with SOCl2 and pyridine gives 3, then 3 with LiAlH(t-Bu)3 gives 4.

Wait, perhaps step 1 is a substitution, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of an epoxide. No, because Br2 is used, not a peracid.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromohydrin. So cyclohexanone plus Br2 and perhaps some water would form a bromohydrin, but the problem doesn't mention water. Alternatively, it's a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by Br.

Wait, another thought: Maybe cyclohexanone is reacting with Br2 in a nucleophilic attack. The carbonyl group is attacked by Br, perhaps leading to a substitution. But ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily. Maybe it's an addition-elimination mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is the formation of a bromo compound via some other mechanism.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that product 1 is 1-bromo-cyclohexanone. Then, step 2 would be treatment with NaOH, which could cause an elimination reaction, forming a ring contraction or something else, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a dibromide, as in 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So step 2 would be elimination, forming cyclohexene.

Then, step 3: cyclohexene treated with SOCl2 and pyridine. Hmm, but I don't think that works. Alternatively, if product 2 is cyclohexene, then perhaps step 3 is some dihydroxylation. But SOCl2 is more for converting alcohols to chlorides or carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides.

Wait, another possibility: if product 2 is cyclohexanone, then step 3 would be converting it to an acyl chloride, but that's the same as earlier.

I'm getting stuck on step 1. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the final product, product 4.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Product 4 is formed from product 3, which is formed from product 2, which comes from product 1.

Assuming that product 4 is cyclohexanol, which is a secondary alcohol.

But wait, cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with an OH group on one carbon. So how many distinct H's are there?

Cyclohexanol has axial and equatorial hydrogens, but the ring is symmetric, so the number of distinct H's is fewer.

Wait, in cyclohexanol, each carbon is CH2 except for the one with OH. Let me count.

The structure is a cyclohexane ring with an OH on one carbon. The carbon with OH has two CH2 groups adjacent to it. Wait, no, cyclohexanol is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-OH, but arranged in a ring. So each carbon is CH2 except the one with OH.

Wait, no, wait, cyclohexanol has a six-membered ring with each carbon having two CH2 groups except the OH-bearing carbon, which has two CH2 groups adjacent to it. Wait, no, in cyclohexanol, each carbon is CH2 except the one where the OH is attached. So the OH is on a CH2 group. So the ring has five CH2 groups and one CH2OH group.

Wait, but wait, no. Cyclohexanol's structure is a six-membered ring with one of the CH2 groups replaced by a CH2OH group.

Wait, no. Let me think correctly: cyclohexanol is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is an -OH attached to the carbon. So the structure is:

Each carbon in the ring is CH2 except the one with OH, which is CH(OH). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct: cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where each carbon has two CH2 groups except one, which has an OH. So the OH is on a CH2 group that is part of the ring. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-OH but in a ring.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally: cyclohexanol is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group attached to one of the carbons. Each carbon in the ring is CH2 except for where the OH is attached. Wait, no, each carbon is CH2, and the OH is on one of them. So the structure is more like:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH arranged in a ring, but that's not correct because a cyclohexane has six CH2 groups, each connected in a ring, but in cyclohexanol, one of the CH2 groups is an OH-substituted carbon, so it's a CH(OH).

Wait, no, the structure of cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring where one of the carbons has an -OH group attached. So, it's a secondary alcohol.

In that case, the molecule has symmetry. For the hydrogen count, considering the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial positions would lead to different H environments, but sometimes some H's are equivalent.

But in any case, the number of distinct H's in cyclohexanol is 8. Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: cyclohexanol is a six-membered ring with an OH group on one carbon. The adjacent carbons have two CH2 groups each.

Each carbon adjacent to the OH is a CH2, and the carbons across the ring are also CH2. So the molecule has:

- The OH-bearing carbon: two H's (since it's a CH2 group, but wait, no, cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol, so the OH is on a CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol, so the OH is attached to a carbon that's connected to two other carbons.

Wait, correct structure: cyclohexanol is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups has an OH. So the structure is:

Each carbon in the ring is CH2 except for the one with OH, which is CH(OH)CH2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct:

In cyclohexanol, the structure is a six-membered ring with each carbon connected to two other carbons. One of these carbons has an -OH group attached, making it a secondary alcohol.

So the molecule has one OH-bearing carbon (which is CH2OH?), no, wait, no, the carbon with the OH is connected to two CH2 groups and the OH. So the structure is:

Each carbon is CH2 except for the OH-bearing carbon, which is CH(OH)CH2. So each of the six carbons in the ring is CH2 except the one with the OH, which is CH2(OH), but that would make it a primary alcohol. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me remember: cyclohexanol is a secondary alcohol. So the OH is attached to a carbon that is connected to two other carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm better off drawing it mentally as a chair.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the hydrogen count.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps lead to a different product, but maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the product 4 as a different molecule.

Wait, alternative scenario: if product 4 is cyclohexanol, then the number of distinct H's would be as follows:

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the carbon next to the OH would have two equivalent H's (if in a chair conformation, axial and equatorial might not be equivalent, but in the case of a simple molecule, perhaps some H's are equivalent).

Wait, maybe I should count the distinct H's:

- The OH is on one carbon (C1).
- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two H's, but perhaps they are equivalent.
- The carbons across (C4) would have two H's, and C3 and C5 each have two H's.

Wait, but in reality, the molecule is symmetric, so the H's on C2 and C6 are equivalent, and the H's on C3 and C5 are equivalent, while C4's H's are all equivalent.

Additionally, the H's on C1 (the OH-bearing carbon) are two H's. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. Cyclohexanol structure is a six-membered ring with an OH group on one carbon. So each carbon has two H's except for the OH-bearing carbon, which has one H (since it's a secondary alcohol: R2CHOH). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cyclohexanol is (CH2)5CH(OH). No, wait, the structure is a six-membered ring where each CH2 is part of the ring, except one, which is CH(OH). So, each carbon has two H's except the OH-bearing carbon, which has two H's as well?

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me correct: cyclohexanol is a cyclic hexane with one OH group on a carbon. So each of the six carbons is CH2 except the one with OH, which is CH2(OH).

Wait, no. Let me think of it as a six-membered ring where each carbon is CH2 except the one where the OH is attached. So that carbon is CH2-OH. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH arranged in a ring.

Wait, but that would make it a primary alcohol. No, wait, in a six-membered ring, every carbon is connected to two other carbons, so the OH is on a carbon connected to two CH2 groups. So the OH-bearing carbon is a secondary alcohol. So each CH2 group in the ring is connected to two other CH2 groups, except the OH-bearing one, which is connected to two CH2 and one OH.

Wait, no. The structure is a six-membered ring with each carbon bonded to two adjacent carbons and two H's, except the OH-bearing carbon, which is bonded to one OH, two CH2 groups, and one H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how many distinct H's there are.

In cyclohexanol, considering the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial H's would be different. But when you consider symmetry, some H's are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct H's is 8.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think differently. If product 4 is a bicyclic compound, perhaps with more symmetry.

Wait, perhaps if step 1 is a bromide substitution, step 2 is elimination to form a double bond, then product 3 is an acyl chloride, and product 4 is a primary alcohol.

Wait, but if product 4 is a primary alcohol, the structure would be different. Let me think: if product 4 is cyclohexylmethanol (CH2OH attached to a cyclohexane ring), then the structure would have the OH on a CH2 group attached to the ring.

In that case, the molecule would have:

- The OH on the CH2 group.
- The adjacent CH2 groups on the ring.

So the molecule would have a center CH2OH attached to the ring. Let's imagine the structure as:

CH2OH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 arranged in a ring.

Wait, no. More accurately, it's a cyclohexane ring with a CH2OH group attached. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but arranged in a ring.

Wait, but that's cyclohexanol again. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe after all the steps, product 4 is cyclohexanol. So how many distinct H's are in cyclohexanol?

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the chair conformation. The OH is in the axial position. Then, the H's on the adjacent carbons (equatorial) are all equivalent. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of distinct H's is 8.

Wait, another approach: each carbon in the ring has two H's except the OH-bearing carbon, which has one H (if it's a secondary alcohol). Wait, no, the cyclohexanol molecule has six carbons, each with two H's except the one with OH, which has two H's as well.

Wait, no, the OH is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups. So, that carbon has two H's and an OH. So each CH2 group in the ring has two H's.

Wait, but perhaps considering symmetry, some H's are equivalent.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule has a center of symmetry. So, the H's on opposite sides of the ring are equivalent. So, in chair conformation, axial and equatorial H's may be different, but in terms of equivalence, maybe some are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of chemically distinct H's is 8.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to count.

Each carbon in the ring has two H's, but considering symmetry:

- The OH-bearing carbon (C1) has two H's. Are these two H's equivalent? Well, in a chair conformation, they would be in different positions, but perhaps in the molecule, they are equivalent due to symmetry. Hmm.

- The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two H's. Are these H's equivalent across the ring? Perhaps.

- The opposite carbon (C4) has two H's, which are equivalent to themselves.

- The other two carbons (C3 and C5) each have two H's.

Wait, perhaps the H's on C1 are not equivalent to each other because one is axial and the other is equatorial. Similarly, the H's on C2 and C6 may have different environments, leading to more distinct H's.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has 8 distinct H's.

Wait, let's think of the molecule as follows:

- C1: OH-bearing carbon. Two H's, perhaps not equivalent.
- C2: Two H's, perhaps equivalent to C6's H's.
- C3 and C5: Each has two H's, which are equivalent within themselves but different from other positions.
- C4: Two H's, equivalent to themselves.

So, let's count:

C1: 2 H's (distinct from others)
C2: 2 H's (equivalent to C6)
C3: 2 H's (equivalent to C5)
C4: 2 H's (equivalent)
C5: same as C3
C6: same as C2.

Wait, but that seems like:

C1: 2 (distinct)
C2: 2 (same as C6)
C3: 2 (same as C5)
C4: 2 (same)
So total distinct H's: 2 (C1) + 2 (C2 and C6) + 2 (C3 and C5) + 2 (C4) = 8? No, because each of these groups may have distinct environments.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

In cyclohexanol, the molecule is symmetric. The C2 and C6 positions are mirror images, so their H's are equivalent. Similarly, C3 and C5 are equivalent, and C4 is its own mirror image.

The C1 has two H's, but they are on the same carbon as the OH, which is a stereogenic center. So, the two H's on C1 are in different environments: one axial and one equatorial, making them non-equivalent.

So, the distinct H's would be:

- C1: 2 H's (distinct)
- C2 and C6: each have 2 H's, but since they're equivalent, it's 2 H's in total (so 2 types)
- C3 and C5: each have 2 H's, again equivalent, so another 2 H's
- C4: 2 H's (equivalent)

Wait, but this approach is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 distinct H's.

But earlier when I thought of the possible options, one of the options is 8 (option B). So perhaps product 4 has 8 chemically distinct H's.

But I'm not certain. Let me think again about the steps leading to product 4.

Wait, perhaps product 4 is a different compound. Let me think:

If step 1 is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a bromo oxide, then step 2 is elimination to form a double bond, product 2 is an enone (cyclohexenone), step 3 converts that into an acyl chloride, and step 4 reduces it to a primary alcohol.

Wait, but if product 4 is a primary alcohol, then the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-OH, but arranged in a ring plus a side chain.

Wait, no. If product 3 is cyclohexenoyl chloride, then product 4 would be cyclohexenylmethanol, which is CH2OH attached to a cyclohexene ring.

In that case, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a CH2OH group attached. So, how many distinct H's would that have?

The cyclohexene ring would have a double bond, perhaps in a position that imparts some symmetry, but the CH2OH group adds more complexity.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct product 4 is cyclohexanol, which has 8 distinct H's. So the answer would be 8, option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product is different, leading to a different number.

Wait, maybe I should consider that product 4 is a bicyclic compound, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire process leads to a compound with more symmetry, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Wait, another possibility: If product 4 is benzyl alcohol, but that's not likely given the starting material.

Another approach: Let me count the number of chemically distinct H's in the possible product structures.

If product 4 is cyclohexanol, then in the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial H's are different, but some are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 8 distinct H's. For example:

- The OH-bearing carbon has two H's (distinct)
- The adjacent carbons each have two H's (but equivalent on each side)
- The opposite carbon's H's are all equivalent.
- The other two carbons have H's that are equivalent.

So, adding up: 2 (C1) + 2 (C2 and C6) + 2 (C3 and C5) + 2 (C4) = 8.

Hmm. So the answer would be 8, option B.


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis starting from cyclohexanone, and the goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4). Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → Product 1**  
   Cyclohexanone is a six-membered cyclic ketone. When treated with bromine (Br₂), the reaction likely involves bromination at the alpha position (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). This forms **2-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.

2. **Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**  
   Heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) leads to an elimination reaction. The bromine atom is removed, and a double bond forms between the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **cyclohexenone** (a cyclic enone) as product 2.

3. **Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl₂, pyridine → Product 3**  
   Cyclohexenone reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This reaction converts the ketone group into an acid chloride, forming **cyclohexenoyl chloride** as product 3.

4. **Step 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(t-Bu)₃ → Product 4**  
   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(t-Bu)₃) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces the acid chloride to a primary alcohol. The final product, **cyclohexylmethanol**, is a primary alcohol with a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH₂OH group.

5. **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**  
   Cyclohexylmethanol has the following structure:  
   - A six-membered cyclohexane ring with a CH₂OH group attached to one of the carbons.  
   - The molecule is symmetric, but the hydrogens on different carbons are in distinct environments due to the presence of the CH₂OH group.  

   Breaking it down:  
   - The CH₂OH group contributes two distinct hydrogens.  
   - The adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two hydrogens, but these are equivalent due to symmetry.  
   - The carbons across the ring (C3 and C5) each have two hydrogens, which are also equivalent.  
   - The carbon opposite the CH₂OH group (C4) has two equivalent hydrogens.  

   Adding these up, there are **8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms** in the molecule.

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- **A) 6**: Incorrect. This underestimates the number of distinct hydrogens.  
- **B) 8**: Correct. Matches the count of distinct hydrogens in cyclohexylmethanol.  
- **C) 10**: Incorrect. Overestimates the number of distinct hydrogens.  
- **D) 7**: Incorrect. Does not match the actual count.  

ANSWER: B
