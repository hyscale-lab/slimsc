Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The question is about their luminosities.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, that can't be right. Because if they have the same λ_max, then T is same. Because λ_max * T = constant (Wien's displacement law). So if λ_max is the same, then T is same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength might be different due to their velocities. But the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the rest frame emission peaks are different, but due to Doppler shifts, they appear at the same observed wavelength. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which
