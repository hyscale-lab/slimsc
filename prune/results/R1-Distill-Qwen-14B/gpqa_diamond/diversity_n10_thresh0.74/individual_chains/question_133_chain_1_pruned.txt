Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that there's a solution of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (which I think is PO4^3-).

Hmm, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The problem gives the three dissociation constants: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the phosphoric acid dissociates in three steps.

Now, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their forms in solution. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, I think it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, along with some H2O molecules, but the exact amount of water probably doesn't affect the ionic concentrations much here.

Wait, but I should calculate the molarities of each of these components first. Because knowing their concentrations will help me figure out the pH of the solution, which in turn will let me determine the concentration of PO4^3-.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each substance.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007333 mol. Wait, more accurately, 136.09 → 1 divided by that is about 0.007333. So 0.007333 moles of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me calculate 1 / 177.99. That should be approximately 0.005616 mol. So about 0.005616 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait a second, because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, this must be a buffer solution. The presence of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-) means that the solution is buffered
