Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Alright, a supernova occurs in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta part and the galaxy are inertial frames. That probably means we don't have to worry about acceleration here.

From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in an inertial frame, velocities are relative, so if one object is moving towards another, the other would appear to move towards it at the same speed.

The question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is different in each frame because of relativity, I think. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, so time dilation comes into play here.

Wait, right, time dilation is part of special relativity. So the proper time (time measured in the moving frame) is different from the time in the stationary frame. The formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t', where t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy's frame) and t' is the proper time (ejecta's frame). Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the problem is that the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that time. Then use that time to calculate the distance the ejecta travels. Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me think again. The ejecta is moving towards the galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame. So from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at that speed. But the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that makes sense because in different frames, the speeds are relative.

But to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame, we need to know
