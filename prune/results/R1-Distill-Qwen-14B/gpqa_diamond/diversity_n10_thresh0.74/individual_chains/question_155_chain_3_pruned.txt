Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see... The question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

Wait, first, let me recall what I know. The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics says that the product of the uncertainties in two observables (like P_z and P_x) is at least half the absolute value of their commutator. Oh right, so the uncertainty ΔP_z would involve the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Oh right, because the state is given as a column vector which is an eigenvector of P_x. So, since it's an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation values might come into play here.

The state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I think I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z and P_z squared. Then, ΔP_z would be the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Hmm, but wait, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, does that mean anything about its relation to P_z? Well, in quantum mechanics, if you have a state that's an eigenstate of one operator, it's generally not an eigenstate of another operator that doesn't commute with it. Since P_x and P_z don't commute (they are components of angular momentum or similar), the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z. So, the expectation values won't be zero, but I need to compute them.

So, the first step is to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that down:

P_z matrix is:

[ ħ    0      0   ]
[ 0    0      0   ]
[ 0    0   -ħ   ]

Wait, no, looking back: The matrix for P_z has first row (ħ,0,0), second (
