Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand the question properly. The question is asking which of the given stars can be observed by both spectrographs. The key is to figure out the apparent V magnitude each star has because both instruments have different brightness limits.

The problem gives me information about each star's parameters, like RA, DEC, absolute magnitude, distance, and sometimes E(B-V) for interstellar extinction. Oh, right, interstellar extinction affects how bright a star appears because dust and gas in the interstellar medium absorb and scatter the light. So I need to account for that when calculating the apparent magnitude.

The two spectrographs have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V=16 mag. Wait, actually, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, meaning it can't observe stars fainter than that. Similarly, HIRES can't observe stars fainter than 16 mag. Wait, no, wait. Magnitudes are a bit confusing because lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So for a star to be observable by HIRES, its apparent magnitude must be ≤16. For ESPRESSO, it's ≤17.

So each star needs to have an apparent magnitude (corrected for extinction) less than or equal to the respective limit for each instrument. But wait, the question is asking which stars can be detected with both instruments. So a star must meet both conditions: its apparent magnitude must be ≤16 (so HIRES can see it) AND ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can see it). But wait, since 16 is less than 17, any star that's ≤16 will also be ≤17. So the main condition is that the star's apparent V magnitude (corrected for extinction) must be ≤16 mag for both to detect it. Because if it's ≤16, then HIRES can see it
