Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Around each, astronomers found a planet using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. Their orbits are circular, so that's good because that means the shifts are periodic and symmetric, which probably makes the calculations easier.

The question is about the orbital periods of the planets. For planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. They want to know how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to its motion caused by the planet's gravity. The star moves towards or away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift in wavelength. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think. Or maybe the velocity of the star's movement?

Wait, the formula I remember for the radial velocity is something like v = (2π G M_p / (P (M_* + M_p))) )^(1/3) * (M_* / (M_* + M_p)) ), but since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so maybe that simplifies to v ≈ ( (2π G M_p ) / (P M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by some formula that includes the planet's mass, the orbital period, the star's mass, and the distance (orbital radius maybe?).

Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the formula I found earlier for K is K = (v) = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p) sin i ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π) ) ) ... or something like that. Wait, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I need to reconstruct it.

Alternatively, perhaps the key point here is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the RV method depends on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's orbital period. So if K is larger, does that mean the period is shorter or longer?

Wait, in the RV method, the star's velocity (K) is given by K = (v) ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (2π) * (P) )^(1/3) ) ) )? Hmm, perhaps not exactly, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I think that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_* )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), assuming that sin i is about 90 degrees (edge-on orbit, so maximum velocity). Since both planets have the same mass and the stars have the same mass, the only variables are the orbital periods.

Wait, so let's see. For K, the formula is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) )

Assuming that sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal, but the problem doesn't specify, but maybe we can assume they're the same or it's not a factor here). Also, since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator becomes M_*^(2/3).

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, that's the formula I think I remember. Or wait, perhaps it's (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3) ), but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I might have an easier approach. Since both stars have the same mass, and both planets have the same mass. So for each, K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3) ), because K would depend on the orbital period as P^(-1/3). Because the star's velocity is higher for shorter orbital periods, as the planet would be moving faster in its orbit.

Wait, so if K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if planet #2 has a larger K (7 vs 5 milliangstroms), then P2 is shorter than P1. Because K is bigger when the period is shorter.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Let's say K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So P is proportional to (1/K^3). So if K increases, P decreases.

In our case, K for planet #1 is 5, and planet #2 is 7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So since P is proportional to 1/K^3, then P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. So the question is, how many times is P2 longer than P1? It's 0.36 times, so it's shorter, meaning it's about 0.36 times longer, but since it's shorter, the actual ratio is 0.36.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 36% of the period, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the ratio is 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the proportionality reversed. Let me double-check the formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (8 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so this simplifies to K ≈ (constant) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But M_p is the same for both planets, and M_* is same for both stars, so K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So rearranging, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, now I'm getting a different result. Let me make sure. So if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ P^(-1/3), which means P ∝ K^(-3).

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, let me do it step by step. Let me denote K1 as the semi-amplitude for planet #1, which is 5 milliangstroms, and K2 as 7 milliangstroms.

Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), we have:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Which is the same as P2 = P1 * (125/343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It is 0.36 times as long. So the question is asking, 'how many times longer is P2 than P1'? So the answer is approximately 0.36 times. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \). This implies that \( P \propto K^{-3} \).

Given:
- \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (planet #1),
- \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) (planet #2),

we calculate the ratio of their orbital periods as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times longer than planet #1's.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
