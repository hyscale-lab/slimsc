Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to piece this together. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, and radii 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii respectively. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The basic formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) ... but wait, no, wait. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh wait, no. The equilibrium temperature equation is T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 ), where a is the planet's orbital distance from the star.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's T_eff is given, and the planets' albedos are the same, so that part will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but since R_star is the same for both, the ratio is sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ), because T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ), since T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it down. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) )

So for each planet,
Te1 = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a1) )
Te2 = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a2) )

Taking the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2a
