Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions using mCPBA on different alkenes, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options are about how many peaks appear in each.

I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used in epoxidation reactions. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic process, right? It adds an oxygen across the double bond, making an epoxide.

Wait, but then after mCPBA, it's treated with aqueous acid. Oh, right, that's acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide. So, the reaction is epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis of the epoxide.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. The structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene would have the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no, octene is eight carbons, so positions 4 and 5. So structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, the structure for (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons, so 4-ene would be between C4 and C5. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I need to think of it as CH3CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond starting at C4. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the structure as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but double bond between C4 and C5: so it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between the two middle carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the carbons. Oct-4-ene has eight carbons, with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should move on and think about the reactions.

Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene: since mCPBA adds an epoxide across the double bond. The geometry of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, in the epoxidation, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen goes into the same face. So, the addition is syn. So, for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxide would have different configurations.

Wait, no, wait. mCPBA is a peracid and adds to the alkene via a cyclic transition state, leading to a trans addition of the oxygen. Wait, no, wait, the peracid adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms (from the peracid) are added to opposite faces. Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid donates an oxygen across the double bond, leading to an epoxide. The addition is syn because the oxygen adds to the same face. So, for a trans (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide will have a trans configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide will have a cis configuration.

Wait, no, wait—wait. Let me think again. The epoxidation reaction by mCPBA is a pericyclic reaction, specifically a [2+2] addition with a cyclic transition state. The peracid adds across the double bond in a syn fashion, meaning that the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the alkene.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When the peracid adds, the oxygen atoms add to the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider the specific cases.

For (E)-oct-4-ene:

The double bond is between C4 and C5. Let's say the substituents on C4 and C5 are both CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's (E)- and (Z)- isomers.

Wait, perhaps the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, the substituents on either side are CH2CH2- and CH2CH3 perhaps. Hmm, perhaps I should imagine it as:

(E)-oct-4-ene: CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, and the higher priority groups on opposite sides.

Epoxidation with mCPBA would add an oxygen across the double bond, making an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, so for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two higher priority groups (on each end of the double bond) are opposite each other. When the peracid adds, the oxygen adds in a syn fashion, so the resulting epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on the same face, but since the starting groups were opposite, the substituents on the epoxide would be on opposite sides. So, the epoxide would be trans.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the higher priority groups are on the same side. Adding the oxygen in a syn fashion would lead to a cis epoxide because both oxygens add to the same face, which is the same side as the substituents.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid. Acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides typically proceeds via a two-step mechanism. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon (since it's more stabilized) in a backside attack, leading to ring opening with inversion of configuration.

Wait, but wait, in acid-catalyzed conditions, the nucleophile (water) can attack either carbon, depending on which is more substituted. If the epoxide is symmetric, then both attack positions are equivalent, leading to a single product.

Wait, but in the case of oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be a four-membered ring, with two CH2 groups on each side (assuming oct-4-ene is symmetric). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. Oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond, right? So, for (E) and (Z) isomers, the epoxide would have two CH2CH2 groups on each side? Or perhaps it's not symmetric.

Wait, no. Let's model this. For oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond is attached to two CH2 groups.

Wait, so epoxidation would give a 4-membered ring: the oxygen connects C4 and C5, each of which is attached to two CH2 groups. So the epoxide would be a symmetrical structure, with each oxygen adjacent to two CH2 groups.

Wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then upon acid hydrolysis, the ring would open in a way that leads to a single product. Because the two possible nucleophilic attacks (on either carbon) would lead to the same product.

Wait, but wait, what's the structure after epoxidation. Let's say the double bond is between C4 and C5.

After epoxidation, each of those carbons (C4 and C5) has two CH2 groups attached and an oxygen bridge. So the structure would be like:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2-O-CH2CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the molecule would be (R)- and (S)-epoxide, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the epoxide would actually not have any chiral centers.

Wait, wait, oct-4-ene is a straight-chain molecule, so after epoxidation, the epoxide would be symmetric. So, in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, which becomes a trans epoxide, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then it might not have any chiral centers.

Wait, but wait—epoxide formation from (E) and (Z) alkenes. Let me think about whether the epoxide would have any chiral centers.

In (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same. So when the epoxide forms, each carbon (C4 and C5) would have two CH2 groups and one oxygen bridge. So the structure would be a trans epoxide, but since the substituents are the same on both sides, the epoxide would actually have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, no chiral centers.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide, but again, because of symmetry, it's a meso compound, leading to no chiral centers. Wait, does that make sense?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. For an epoxide with two identical groups on each side, regardless of the configuration, it's a meso compound. So, (E) and (Z) alkenes would form epoxides that are meso compounds, meaning they are achiral.

Wait, but if that's the case, then when they undergo acid hydrolysis, would they give the same product?

Wait, but if the epoxide is a meso compound, then upon ring-opening, the product would have two stereocenters. Let me think.

Wait, when an epoxide ring opens under acidic conditions, each oxygen is protonated, and the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. In a symmetric epoxide, both carbons are equally substituted, so the attack can happen on either carbon. But due to ring strain, the attack would lead to a specific configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, the attack on either carbon would lead to the same product. So, the product would be a diol, but the configuration of the diol would depend on the starting epoxide.

Wait, perhaps for each reaction, the epoxide would open to form a diol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me imagine the epoxide as a symmetric structure, O connected to C4 and C5, each of which is connected to two CH2 groups.

In acid, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Water attacks one of the carbons. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can occur from either side, but because the leaving group is leaving, the backside attack would lead to inversion.

Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide, whether the attack is on C4 or C5, the product would be the same. So, perhaps the diol formed would have two chiral centers, but they would be in a meso arrangement, making the diol achiral.

Wait, but wait. Let's take an example. Take cyclohexene oxide, which is a symmetric epoxide. If it's opened under acidic conditions, the product is cyclohexanediol, which is a meso compound with two chiral centers but an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, in our case, the epoxide would be a symmetric structure, so the diol formed would be a meso compound, thus achiral.

Wait, but what about when the starting epoxide is formed from (E) and (Z) alkenes? Would that affect the diol's configuration?

Wait, no, because if the epoxide is symmetric, regardless of how it was formed, the diol would be a meso compound.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. If the epoxide is formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, which would give a trans epoxide, but since the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound. So, when it's opened, the diol would have two identical stereocenters, but in a way that they are mirror images, leading to a meso compound.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide, but again, because of symmetry, it's a meso compound, leading to the same diol upon ring opening.

Wait, that can't be right, because then both reactions would give the same diol, which would be a meso compound. But then, when you combine them, you might have the same product. But that would mean that in the HPLC, you'd see only one peak in the standard and chiral columns.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that the epoxide is symmetric. Let me think again about the structure.

Wait, oct-4-ene: the double bond is between C4 and C5. Each of these carbons is attached to two CH2 groups on either side. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but as a double bond between C4 and C5.

So, the epoxide would be a four-membered ring, with O connected to C4 and C5. Each of these carbons is attached to two CH2 groups (on either side of the double bond). So, the structure of the epoxide would be symmetric. So, for both (E) and (Z) alkenes, the resulting epoxides would be meso compounds.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. The (E) and (Z) alkenes would form different epoxide structures, right? Because the addition of the oxygen is syn or anti.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the peracid adds to the same face of the alkene. So, for the (E) isomer, the substituents are opposite, and the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the specific structures.

Let's model (E)-oct-4-ene as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5, and the higher priority groups (like CH2CH2 and CH2CH3) on opposite sides.

Epoxidation with mCPBA would add an oxygen in a syn addition, meaning both oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond. So, for the (E) isomer, the oxygen adds to the same face, which was the top face of both carbons (since the substituents are opposite). This would form a trans epoxide.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The (E) configuration has the higher priority groups on opposite sides. So, when the oxygen adds to the same face (syn addition), the substituents would end up on adjacent sides.

Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Imagine (E)-oct-4-ene as:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2
       \   /
        C=C
       /   \
CH2CH2-CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me imagine the double bond as C4 and C5:

The structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5.

In the (E) configuration, the two CH2CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond, so both oxygens add to the top face (for example), creating an epoxide.

In the (E) case, adding to the same face would cause the substituents on each carbon (from the double bond) to be on the same side, leading to a cis epoxide. Wait, but wait—if the starting substituents are on opposite faces, adding oxygen to the same face would cause the substituents and the oxygen to be on the same side, leading to a cis arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should think about the transition state for epoxidation.

In the epoxidation reaction, the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to a cyclic transition state where the two new oxygen bonds form simultaneously.

The addition is syn, meaning both oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (higher priority groups) are on opposite sides. Adding oxygen to the same face would lead the oxygen to be on the same side as one substituent and opposite the other. No, wait—since the substituents are on opposite sides, adding oxygen to the same face would mean the substituents and the oxygen are on the same face.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a Newman projection.

Imagine looking along the double bond. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents (like CH2CH2 and CH2CH3) are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face (front) of both carbons. So, both oxygens are added to the front. This would result in a trans epoxide because the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides relative to the oxygen bridge.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the starting alkene is (E), the substituents are opposite. If the oxygen adds to the same face of each carbon, the substituents will end up on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed is trans, but for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis.

But wait, in the case of a meso epoxide, the molecule is achiral, but when it opens, it forms a diol with two chiral centers.

So, for each reaction:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide (meso) → acid hydrolysis → diol (meso compound, so achiral).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide (also meso, because symmetric) → acid hydrolysis → diol (meso, achiral).

But wait, that can't be right because both reactions would produce the same diol, which is a meso compound. So when the products are combined, they are the same compound.

But that would mean in the HPLC, both standard and chiral columns would show one peak.

But none of the options say that. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral

C) 2 in both

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral.

Hmm. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide isn't symmetric. Maybe I got the structure wrong.

Wait, let's think again about the structure of oct-4-ene. It's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So, each end of the double bond is connected to a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH3 group? No, that can't be right because octene is eight carbons. Let me number them:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3?

No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5, making it a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, but that would make it a seven-carbon chain, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but that would be nine carbons, which is incorrect. I must be getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, positions 4 and 5 are double-bonded, and each is connected to a CH2 group on one side and a CH2CH3 group on the other. So, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5, making the substituents on each end of the double bond a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the higher priority groups (like CH2CH3 and CH2CH2) would be on opposite sides of the double bond. For (Z), they'd be on the same side.

When mCPBA adds to the double bond in a syn fashion, the oxygen adds to the same face. So, for (E), the substituents are opposite, and adding oxygen to the same face would cause the two substituents (CH2CH3 and CH2CH2) to be on the same side as the oxygen, leading to a cis epoxide. Wait, but that would make the epoxide have substituents on the same side, so the epoxide would be cis.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the epoxide isn't symmetric because the substituents on each end are different. So, the epoxide would have two different substituents on each carbon, making it a chiral molecule.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if each carbon in the epoxide is attached to different groups, then the epoxide would have a chiral center.

Wait, let's model this.

If the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene, then after epoxidation, each carbon in the epoxide (C4 and C5) is connected to:

- C4: one CH2CH2 group (from C3 and C4) and one CH2CH3 group (from C5 and C6).

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, each carbon in the epoxide (C4 and C5) would have:

- C4: two groups from the left side (like CH2CH2 and another CH2).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the epoxide would be formed between C4 and C5, each attached to two different groups.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the epoxide has a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2 group? No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon is attached to a CH2CH2 group and a CH2 group on either end.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Assume that the epoxidation leads to a non-symmetric epoxide. Then, each epoxide would have two chiral centers. When acid is added, the epoxide would ring-open into a diol.

But the ring-opening would depend on the configuration of the epoxide. So, the diastereomers would form different diols.

Wait, but if the epoxide is not symmetric, then the acid-catalyzed ring-opening would lead to diastereomers or enantiomers depending on the attack direction.

Wait, but mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, so the configuration of the epoxide would determine the diol's configuration.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide with certain configuration → diol.

For Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → different epoxide → different diol.

Wait, but maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no, because if the starting epoxide is chiral, then the ring-opening could lead to two different diastereomers, depending on the attack direction.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon due to its higher partial positive charge, or perhaps it's more about the carbocation stability.

Wait, in an asymmetric epoxide, the more substituted carbon is more electrophilic, so the attack occurs there. So, in each case, the diol would have a specific configuration.

But wait, if the epoxide is chiral, then opening it would produce a diol with two chiral centers. But if the epoxide is a single enantiomer, the diol would have a specific configuration.

Wait, but in our case, the epoxide is formed from a single enantiomer of the alkene. So, for each reaction, the epoxide would be a single enantiomer, leading to a specific diol upon ring-opening.

Wait, but when you have an epoxide that is a single enantiomer, upon ring-opening under acidic conditions, would it produce a single diastereomer or a mixture?

Wait, no, because the ring-opening is a backside attack, leading to inversion. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, but perhaps it can form either R or S configuration.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide A.

Then, epoxide A + aqueous acid → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide B.

Then, epoxide B + aqueous acid → diol B.

Now, each diol (A and B) would have two chiral centers. But are they the same or different?

If the starting epoxides are different (due to different starting alkenes), then diols A and B would be different.

Furthermore, each diol could potentially be a pair of enantiomers or a single compound.

Wait, but if the epoxide A and B are enantiomers, then their diols would be enantiomers as well.

Wait, if the starting alkenes are E and Z, and the epoxidation leads to trans and cis epoxides, but in a way that they are enantiomers, then the diols would be enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are diastereomers.

Hmm. Let me think about the specific case.

Suppose that epoxide A from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans epoxide with a certain configuration, leading to diol A with two chiral centers in a particular arrangement.

Epoxide B from (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives diol B with a different arrangement of chiral centers.

But I'm not sure if diol A and diol B are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, another approach: when you have a trans epoxide and a cis epoxide, and they're mirror images, then their diols would be mirror images as well, hence enantiomers.

Alternatively, if they are diastereomers, then their diols would not be mirror images.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the actual structures.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two enantiomers of the diol.

Wait, no, because if the epoxide is a single enantiomer, then the ring-opening under acidic conditions would produce one diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is a single enantiomer, and the diol has two chiral centers with a specific configuration.

But when you have an epoxide that's a single enantiomer, the ring-opening would produce a diol with a certain configuration. But wait, in the case of an asymmetric epoxide, the ring-opening could lead to two possible diols, but in reality, under specific conditions, it would lead to one major product.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the number of possible stereoisomers.

For each reaction, the epoxide could be a single enantiomer, leading to a single diol with two chiral centers. But if the diol has two chiral centers and is not a meso compound, then it would have four possible stereoisomers (2^2 =4). But depending on the starting material, only two would be formed.

Wait, but if the starting epoxide is a single enantiomer, then the diol would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but wait, when the epoxide opens, the attack could be on either carbon, but under acidic conditions, the more substituted carbon is attacked. So, in an asymmetric epoxide, only one diol would form.

So, perhaps each reaction produces a single diol with two chiral centers.

But if the diol from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are enantiomers, then when combined, they would form a racemic mixture. But in that case, on a standard HPLC (achiral), they would appear as one peak, but on a chiral HPLC, they would split into two peaks.

Alternatively, if the diols are diastereomers, then they would have different properties and show as separate peaks on both columns.

Wait, but for the case of (E) and (Z) alkenes, the diols would be diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Because if the starting alkenes are E and Z, and the epoxidation leads to trans and cis epoxides, then the diols would have different configurations, making them diastereomers.

So, each reaction produces a single diol, and the two diols are diastereomers.

When combined, they would show as two separate peaks on both the standard and chiral HPLCs.

But that's option C: 2 peaks in both.

Wait, but let me think again. If each reaction produces two enantiomers, then when combined, they would form a racemic mixture, which would be a single peak on the standard HPLC and two peaks on the chiral HPLC. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, if each reaction produces a single diastereomer, then combining them would give two different diastereomers, which would show as two peaks on both columns.

So, when the products are combined, two diols are present, which are diastereomers. On the standard HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between enantiomers, they would appear as two separate peaks because they're different compounds. On the chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since these are diastereomers, they would also appear as two separate peaks. Wait, but wait, chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. Wait, no, diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute at different times on chiral columns as well.

Wait, no. On a standard (achiral) column, diastereomers would have different retention times and appear as separate peaks. On a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, diastereomers would still appear as separate peaks because they're not mirror images. So, in this case, the two diols would show as two peaks on both columns.

So, the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLCs.

But wait, what if the diols are actually the same compound? No, because they come from different starting materials, leading to different configurations.

Wait, perhaps each diol has two chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. When combined, they would form a racemic mixture if they're enantiomers, but that's only if the two diols are mirror images.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two enantiomers of the diol, leading to four possible stereoisomers in total.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible number of stereoisomers.

Each diol has two chiral centers. So, possible stereoisomers: 4 (if not meso).

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

If diol A is a single enantiomer, then combining diols A and B (from Reaction 2) would give a mixture.

Wait, but how many stereoisomers would each reaction produce?

In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A, which has two chiral centers. Since the epoxide is a single enantiomer, the diol would have a specific configuration, perhaps a single stereoisomer.

Similarly, Reaction 2 → diol B, another stereoisomer.

If diol A and diol B are enantiomers, then combining them would give a racemic mixture, which would show as one peak on standard HPLC and two peaks on chiral HPLC. But that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, if diol A and diol B are diastereomers, then combining them would give two separate peaks on both HPLC columns.

So, I'm thinking that the correct answer is option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLCs.

But wait, let's think about the possible products again.

Upon epoxidation, (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide with a certain configuration, and (Z)-oct-4-ene would form another. Each epoxide, upon acid hydrolysis, would form a diol with two chiral centers, which are diastereomers.

Thus, combining them would give two different diols, each with two chiral centers and each a single stereoisomer. So, on standard HPLC, they would appear as two separate peaks because they're different compounds. On chiral HPLC, since they're diastereomers, they'd still appear as two separate peaks. So, the answer is C: 2 peaks in both.

Wait, but another possibility is that each reaction produces two enantiomers of the diol, leading to four stereoisomers in total. But that would mean each diol has two enantiomers, so combining them would give four peaks on chiral HPLC.

But wait, no. Each reaction would produce a single enantiomer. So, combining two enantiomeric diols would give a racemic mixture, which would be a single peak on standard HPLC and two peaks on chiral HPLC. But that's not the case here because the two diols are from different starting materials.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, leading to four stereoisomers in total. But that doesn't make sense because each reaction would produce a single product.

Hmm. I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it differently.

When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, the diol formed would have two chiral centers. Each reaction produces a diol with a specific configuration. So, Reaction 1 gives diol A, and Reaction 2 gives diol B. These diols are diastereomers because their configurations are different.

Thus, when combined, they would result in two diastereomers. On a standard HPLC, which doesn't distinguish between diastereomers, they would appear as two separate peaks. On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers but not diastereomers, they would also appear as two separate peaks.

Wait, no. Chiral columns separate enantiomers, but not diastereomers. So, diastereomers would appear as a single peak on a chiral column because the column doesn't differentiate between them. Wait, no, that's not correct. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so even on a chiral column, they would elute at different times.

Wait, no. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. Diastereomers, which are not mirror images, have different physical properties and would elute at different times on both achiral and chiral columns.

So, if I have two diastereomers, they would give two peaks on both columns.

So, the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLCs.


The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each case.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition. The geometry of the starting alkene (E or Z) determines the configuration of the resulting epoxide.
   - Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide opens the ring, typically via nucleophilic attack on the more substituted carbon, leading to a diol.

2. **Epoxide Formation**:
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. mCPBA adds syn, forming a **trans epoxide**.
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are on the same side. mCPBA adds syn, forming a **cis epoxide**.

3. **Diol Formation**:
   - Acid hydrolysis of the epoxide results in a diol with two chiral centers. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the starting epoxide.
   - The diol from the trans epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene) and the diol from the cis epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene) are **diastereomers**, not enantiomers.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. Since the two diols are diastereomers, they will also elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Combining the products of both reactions results in two diastereomeric diols. These diols will produce two peaks on both standard and chiral HPLC columns due to their differing physical properties.

### Correct Answer:
**C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC**

Answer: C
