Okay, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think about each part.

So, the compound was identified using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. Hmm, I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually suggests O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more easily. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

The peak at 1700 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a strong absorption around there. So that fits.

Now looking at the NMR. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, meaning there are no double bonds (like in alkenes) present. So the compound is likely a saturated molecule.

The 1H NMR shows two complex multiplets. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Let me think about what that implies. These splitting patterns suggest that the protons are adjacent to multiple neighboring groups. Maybe they're in a substituent that's branching off a central structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is like CH2COOH attached to a central C that's connected to two C2H5 groups and another CH3? Wait, maybe it's a central carbon connected to two C2H5 and two CH3 groups? Or perhaps the central carbon is CH2COOH, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, the formula for option A is CH3–C(H)(C2H5)–C(H)(C2H5)–CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each connected to a C2H5, forming a structure like -C(CH2CH3)(CH2CH3)-CH2COOH. Wait, but that would make the structure more like maybe (CH2CH3)2CHCH2COOH? No, wait, perhaps it's (CH2CH3)2C-CH2COOH. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. That would make a central part where the two middle carbons each have a CH group with C2H5 substituents. So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 and connected to each other, then the COOH is at the end.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
So it's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2
