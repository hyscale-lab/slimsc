Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance of this quasar based on the given cosmological parameters. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in observational astronomy, when the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, it might be due to something called the Lyman break. Oh right, the Lyman break is when the flux from a galaxy drops sharply below a certain wavelength because the intergalactic medium (like neutral hydrogen) is absorbing the light. That absorption happens around the Lyman limit, which is about 91 nm for hydrogen, but wait, the observed wavelength would be longer if it's redshifted.

So if the peak is at 790 nm and the flux drops below that, maybe that's the Lyman break. So that would mean that the wavelength we're seeing, 790 nm, corresponds to the rest frame Lyman limit. So the Lyman limit in rest is 91 nm, so the observed wavelength is 790 nm. The redshift z would be (790 / 91) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 divided by 91 is approximately 8.68. So 8.68 minus 1 is 7.68. So z is about 7.68.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman break is when the galaxy emits light up to 91 nm, but beyond that is absorbed. So when we observe it, the break is at longer wavelengths. So if the observed wavelength is 790, then the rest wavelength is 91, so (1 + z) = 790 / 91 ≈ 8.68, so z≈7.68.

Now, the next step is to find the comoving distance at a redshift of approximately 7.68. The cosmological parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωk=0).

I think the comoving distance D_C is related to the integral of 1/(H(z)) dz, but I'm not too clear on the exact formula. Oh wait, the comoving distance for a given redshift is the integral from 0 to z of c / H(a) da, where a is the scale factor, and a=1/(1+z). So I need to compute this integral with the given cosmological parameters.

But wait, I'm not sure how to compute that integral exactly. Maybe I can approximate it or remember some typical values. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for high redshifts like z ~8, the comoving distance is around a certain value.

Alternatively, I remember that when z is much larger than 1, the dark energy's effect becomes less significant, and matter dominates. But dark energy (cosmological constant) contributes to the expansion as well.

Wait, maybe there's a way to think about this. The comoving distance for high redshifts can be approximated, I think. For a flat universe, the comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) multiplied by some integral factor that depends on the cosmological parameters.

The formula is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)] dz'

Hmm, but how do I compute that without integrating? Maybe I can use an approximation or remember that for Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z≈7.7 is around 13 billion light-years or so. Wait, but the options are in gigaparsecs. Oh right, 1 gigaparsec is approximately 3.26 billion light-years.

Wait, let's think again. Wait, the Hubble constant is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. So 70 km/s per Mpc. But to get the age of the universe or other distances, I might need to calculate using these parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator or some approximate formula. But since I'm just thinking, let me recall that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at high z (like z=7) is roughly in the range of about 10-13 billion light-years.

Wait, another approach: comoving distance D_C is (c/H0) * the integral from 0 to z [1 / E(z')] dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). So the integral is ∫0^z [1 / E(z')] dz'.

But wait, maybe using lookback time or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate value.

Wait, I think for z=7, the comoving distance is approximately 14 Gpc. But wait, the options don't go that high. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I shouldn't have used the Lyman limit. Wait, the question said the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. So the Lyman break occurs at 790 nm, which is the 91 nm (rest) * (1+z). So maybe 790 = 91*(1+z) → 1+z = 790/91 ≈ 8.68 → z≈7.68.

Yes, that's correct. So z≈7.68.

Now, the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/H(z) dz', but H(z) is H0 * E(z), where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

So H(z) = 70 km/s/Mpc * sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

Wait, but when z is large, like 7, the term (1+z)^3 is 512, so 0.3 * 512 is 153.6. The dark energy term is 0.7, which is much smaller. So E(z) ≈ sqrt(153.6 + 0.7) ≈ sqrt(154.3) ≈ 12.42.

So H(z) ≈70 * 12.42 ≈ 869.4 km/s/Mpc.

But wait, H(z) is 70 * sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). Hmm, but when z is 7, (1+z)=8, so (1+z)^3=512. Then 0.3*512=153.6, 0.7* (1+z)^0 =0.7. So E(z)=sqrt(153.6 +0.7)=sqrt(154.3)≈12.42.

So H(z)=70 * 12.42 = 869.4 km/s/Mpc.

Wait, but D_C is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(z)) dz. Let me think about the units. c is the speed of light, which is about 3e5 km/s. H(z) is in km/s/Mpc. So (c/H(z)) would have units of Mpc * s / (km/s) ) → Wait, km/s divided by (km/s/Mpc) is Mpc. So the integral adds up Mpc units, which is correct.

Hmm, but integrating from 0 to z might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for D_C when z is much larger than 1.

Wait, in the matter-dominated era, when Ωm dominates, E(z)=sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3) = sqrt(Ωm) (1+z)^{3/2}, so 1/E(z) = 1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z)^{3/2}).

So the integral ∫0^z [1 / E(z')] dz' = ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(Ωm) (1 + z')^{3/2}) ] dz'.

Let me change variable u=1+z', so du=dz'. The limits become u=1 to u=1+z.

Integral becomes ∫1^{1+z} [ u^{-3/2} / sqrt(Ωm) } du ]

Which is [ (-2) / sqrt(Ωm) ) * u^{-1/2} ] from 1 to 1+z.

= (2 / sqrt(Ωm)) [ 1/sqrt(1) - 1/sqrt(1+z) ) ]

= (2 / sqrt(Ωm)) [ 1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ) ]

But wait, this is only valid when matter dominates, which for z=7.68, with Ωm=0.3, and dark energy Ωλ=0.7, does matter dominate? Hmm, no, because dark energy density is constant, while matter density scales as (1+z)^3.

At z=7.68, (1+z) is 8.68, so (1+z)^3 is about 650. So Ωm*(1+z)^3 =0.3 * 650≈195, and Ωλ=0.7. So E(z)=sqrt(195 + 0.7)=sqrt(195.7)=~14. So Ωm*(1+z)^3 is about 195, which is much larger than dark energy's 0.7. So during much of the expansion from z=0 to z=7.68, matter dominates. Only at very high z (like z> something) does dark energy start to have significant contribution. Wait, but at z=7, (1+z)^3 is 512, so Ωm*(1+z)^3 = 0.3*512=153.6, and dark energy is 0.7. So for z=7, matter is still dominant.

Wait, but for very high z, like z>5, dark energy's contribution becomes negligible. So perhaps the integral can be approximated as in the matter-dominated case.

So for matter-dominated:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/sqrt(Ωm)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

But wait, c is 3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by (2/sqrt(0.3)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+7.68) ]

sqrt(0.3) is approximately 0.5477. So 2/0.5477≈3.648.

sqrt(1+7.68)=sqrt(8.68)=≈2.946. So 1/2.946≈0.339.

So [1 - 0.339] = 0.661.

So D_C≈4285.7 Mpc * 3.648 * 0.661.

Let me compute that:

3.648 * 0.661 ≈ 2.412.

4285.7 * 2.412 ≈ Let's see: 4000 *2.412=9648, 285.7*2.412≈700 (approx). Total around 10348 Mpc, which is 10.348 Gpc.

Hmm, but that's an approximation under the assumption that matter dominates all the way to z=7.68. However, in reality, dark energy contributes a little, so the comoving distance would be a bit larger than in the matter-only case, because dark energy makes the expansion accelerate, which would increase the comoving distance.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The comoving distance is longer when H(z) is smaller because you spend more time (in terms of proper time) at lower H(z). So for dark energy, which causes H(z) to be higher, because dark energy contributes positively to the expansion. So if H(z) is higher, then 1/H(z) is smaller, so the integral ∫1/H(z) dz would be smaller. So if dark energy is present, the comoving distance would be less than in a matter-only universe. So my approximation using matter-only gives D_C=10.3 Gpc, but reality, with dark energy, it would be a bit smaller.

So maybe around 9 Gpc or 8 Gpc.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for z=7, the comoving distance is around 13 Gpc. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate approach. Let's consider that the universe is flat, and use the formula for the comoving distance:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [ 1 / sqrt(Ωm(1+z')^3 + Ωλ) ] dz'

But integrating this exactly without a calculator is tough. Maybe I can use a look-up table or an approximate expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula from cosmology textbooks. For a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * [ (2/√Ωm) [1 - (1+z)^(-0.5)] ] / (1 + (Ωλ / Ωm) (1 + z)^(-3) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the integral ∫0^z dz' / E(z') is approximately:

For z << 1, E(z) ≈ 1, so the integral is approximately z.

For higher z, the integral can be approximated as (2/sqrt(Ωm)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)] ] / (1 + (Ωλ/Ωm) (1 + z)^{-3/2} )

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I should look for a way to compute this numerically, but I can't do that right now. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a series expansion or use an online calculator if I knew one.

Wait, but I'm supposed to think through this as a student. Another approach: perhaps I can remember some approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts.

For example, I think that at z=1, the comoving distance is around 2 Gpc. Wait, no, that can't be right. I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I can use the age of the universe as a check. The age of the universe for Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7 is about 13.7 billion years. Hmm, but that's the age. The comoving distance also depends on the expansion history.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [ 1 / sqrt( Ωm(1+z')^3 + Ωλ ) ] dz'

But I need to compute this integral. I can approximate it numerically.

Let me create a table of E(z) and the integrand 1/E(z) for different z, then sum them up using the trapezoidal rule or similar.

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find some approximate value.

Wait, perhaps the comoving distance for z=7 in our cosmology is around 14 Gpc. But the options are up to 9 Gpc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the redshift. Let me recheck.

The Lyman break is observed at 790 nm. The Lyman limit is 91 nm in rest frame. So (1 + z) = 790 /91 ≈8.68, so z≈7.68.

Wait, but maybe I mixed up the break direction. The Lyman break is when the galaxy's own emission is cut off at 91 nm, but when this is observed beyond that, the flux drops. Wait, no, the break is at the edge of the observed spectrum. So if the peak is at 790 nm and flux drops below that, it's the Lyman break. So 790 is the 91*(1+z).

Yes, that's correct.

So z is about 7.68. Now, what's the comoving distance for z=7.68 in the given cosmology.

From online sources or textbooks, I remember that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distances at various z are:

z=0.5 → ~1.7 Gpc

z=1 → ~3.3 Gpc

z=2 → ~7 Gpc

z=3 → ~11 Gpc

z=5 → ~15 Gpc

z=7 → ~20 Gpc? Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't go that high.

Wait, perhaps my memory is wrong. Maybe it's smaller. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance as a function of z can be found using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1/E(z') ] dz'

E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ)

So I can approximate this integral as follows.

Divide the integral into several steps, but that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate value using an online calculator or a tool. But since I can't do that, I have to estimate.

Wait, maybe using the fact that for high z, the integral approaches a certain limit.

But perhaps I can use the approximation for the comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe and then correct for dark energy.

In a matter-only universe (Ωm=1, Ωλ=0), the comoving distance at z is D = (c/H0) * (2 / sqrt(Ωm)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ].

So with Ωm=0.3, it's D = (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(0.3)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) ]

Wait, no, in a matter-only flat universe, Ωm=1, so E(z)=sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3) = (1+z)^{3/2}.

Wait, but in our case, Ωm=0.3, so E(z)=sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

Hmm, perhaps I can use the approximation that for z<<1, dark energy dominates, but for high z, matter dominates.

So at z=7.68, matter dominates, so the integral is dominated by the matter term.

So let's compute it using the matter-dominated approximation.

Compute (c/H0) * (2/sqrt(Ωm)) [1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z)) ]

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.

sqrt(Ωm)=sqrt(0.3)=~0.5477.

1 - 1/sqrt(1+7.68)=1 - 1/sqrt(8.68)≈1 -1/2.946≈0.661.

So D_C ≈ 4285.7 * (2 / 0.5477) * 0.661.

Compute 2/0.5477≈3.648.

So 4285.7 * 3.648 * 0.661.

Let me compute 3.648 * 0.661 ≈ 2.412.

Then 4285.7 * 2.412 ≈ let's approximate:

4285.7 * 2 = 8571.4

4285.7 * 0.412 ≈ 1765. So total ≈ 10336 Mpc = 10.3 Gpc.

But wait, earlier I thought that dark energy would reduce this value because dark energy makes expansion faster, which would mean smaller D_C. So with dark energy, D_C would be smaller than 10.3 Gpc.

So perhaps the actual D_C is around 9 Gpc or 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option C is 9 Gpc, D is7 Gpc.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: using the formula for the luminosity distance, but wait that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the comoving distance for z=7 in our cosmology (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7) is approximately 15 Gpc. But that's larger than any of the options provided.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the redshift calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha emission line. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm rest frame. So if observed at 790 nm, then (1 + z)=790/121≈6.5289, so z≈5.5289.

Wait, but the flux drops at wavelengths <790 nm. So if the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that, perhaps that's the Lyman-alpha break. But wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm, so the observed wavelength would be 121*(1+z)=790 → z≈(790/121)-1≈6.528.

Hmm, but in that case, the redshift is about 5.5, which is lower than before. Then the comoving distance may be lower.

Wait, but the initial assumption was that the break is due to the Lyman limit, but perhaps it's due to Lyman-alpha. The Lyman-alpha forest is prominent in quasar spectra, but the Lyman break is when the intergalactic medium absorbs light below a certain wavelength.

Wait, perhaps I should think clearly. The Lyman limit is 91 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that corresponds to a redshift of (790/91) -1 ≈7.68.

So the quasar's emission is being absorbed beyond 91 nm, so the observed Lyman break is at 790 nm. Hence, the redshift is about z=7.68.

So going back, the comoving distance is about 10.3 Gpc in a matter-only universe. But with dark energy, it's a bit less. So perhaps around 9 Gpc.

Wait, but the options don't have 10 Gpc. The closest higher option is 9 Gpc.

Another thought: perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

Let me compute the integral numerically, but approximately.

The integral ∫0^7.68 [1/E(z') ] dz', where E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

I'll approximate the integral by evaluating E(z) at several points and using the trapezoidal rule.

But that's a bit time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for z=7, the integrand 1/E(z) is approximately 1/12.42≈0.0805.

But over a span of 7.68, each dz contributes about 0.08, so the integral would be around 0.08 *7.68≈0.614.

But wait, that's a very rough approximation. The integrand changes with z.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the comoving distance can be approximated using the formula for the age of the universe and the Hubble parameter at different times.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I'll have to just make an educated guess.

Given that the options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)7.

Wait, another approach: using the lookback time formula. The lookback time for a given z is the difference between the current time and the time when the light was emitted. But I'm not sure how that would directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a standard value. I found a source once that for z=7 in the standard cosmology (H0=70, Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7), the comoving distance is approximately 16 Gpc. But that's higher than any of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in calculating the redshift.

Wait, the Lyman break occurs when the galaxy's emission is cut off at 91 nm, and beyond that, the flux drops. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's the wavelength where the Lyman break occurs, so the observed wavelength is 790 nm. So (1 +z) = 790 /91≈8.68 → z≈7.68.

Hmm. So the redshift is about 7.68. So considering that, what is the comoving distance?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. So perhaps it's the Balmer break instead, but that's more around 400 nm. So no, more likely the Lyman break.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is at the rest frame wavelength, but that doesn't make sense because the peak would shift due to redshift.

Hmm, I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the earlier approximation, the comoving distance is around 10 Gpc, but with dark energy, maybe 9 Gpc.

Wait, but the options don't include 10. So perhaps the correct option is 9 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar observed at a redshift corresponding to the Lyman break. The observed peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below this wavelength. This suggests the Lyman break, which occurs at the Lyman limit (91 nm in the rest frame). The redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
1 + z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} = \frac{790}{91} \approx 8.68 \implies z \approx 7.68
\]

With this redshift, the comoving distance \( D_C \) is determined using the cosmological parameters: \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \), and a flat universe (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)).

The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

Here, \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), and the integral depends on the expansion history of the universe. For high redshifts (\( z \approx 7.68 \)), matter dominates over dark energy, so the integral can be approximated using the matter-dominated case:

\[
D_C \approx \frac{c}{H_0} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{\Omega_m}} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z}} \right]
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4285.7 \, \text{Mpc} \),
- \( \sqrt{\Omega_m} = \sqrt{0.3} \approx 0.5477 \),
- \( \sqrt{1+z} = \sqrt{8.68} \approx 2.946 \),

we calculate:

\[
D_C \approx 4285.7 \cdot \frac{2}{0.5477} \cdot \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{2.946} \right]
\]

\[
\frac{2}{0.5477} \approx 3.648, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{2.946} \approx 0.661
\]

\[
D_C \approx 4285.7 \cdot 3.648 \cdot 0.661 \approx 10.3 \, \text{Gpc}
\]

However, dark energy slightly modifies the expansion history, reducing the comoving distance compared to the matter-only case. Thus, the comoving distance is slightly less than \( 10.3 \, \text{Gpc} \). Among the provided options, the closest reasonable estimate is \( 9 \, \text{Gpc} \).

ANSWER: C
