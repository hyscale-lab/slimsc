Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, specifically V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So this is similar to the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator problem.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator have a specific structure, and the states are described by quantum numbers.

Wait, let me think. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). But since it's isotropic, the coordinates are symmetric, so another approach is to use the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2). Or wait, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer.

Wait, but wait, I think actually, each of the directions contributes (n_i + 1/2)ħω, so adding them up, the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Which is the same as (n + 3/2) ħω, since n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So that seems correct.

Now, the third excited state. Hmm, what's the ground state and the excited states? The ground state is the lowest energy state, which is when n=0: (0 + 3/2) ħω. The first excited state is n=1, then n=2, then n=3. Wait, but wait, sometimes "excited" is counted from the next state. So ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state would be n=3.

So the energy E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That would be the energy part. Now, the other part of the question is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. So, how many distinct eigenfunctions (states) have the same energy when n=3?

Wait, because in 3D, the states with the same n can have different distributions of n_x, n_y,
