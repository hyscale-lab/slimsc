Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both were detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Hmm, so the key here is the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh wait, but more specifically, the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_star) times something else? No, wait, another thought: the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (e sin i)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), sin i is just 1 because i is 90 degrees for a transiting orbit. Wait, no, that's not right. The probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's size relative to our line of sight. Oh, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) depends on the planet's orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula I've heard before is P = (R*/a) * ( (R_p)/(R*) )^2, or something like that? Or maybe it's (R_p / a) multiplied by (something else). Alternatively, I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital distance is smaller relative to the star's size. Wait, wait, I think I need to get this straight.

The transit probability, P, is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen edge-on. So, when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to us, we see the transit. The probability is approximately (R_*)Â² / (a)^2, multiplied by the solid angle factor, but maybe it's more like (R_*) / a, because the planet has
