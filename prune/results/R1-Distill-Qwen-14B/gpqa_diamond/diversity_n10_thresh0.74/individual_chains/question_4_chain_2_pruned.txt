Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles—like you can't just have a single north without a south. That's why things like bar magnets have two ends. But in this question, the universe is different. So, how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are these four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. I think the relevant one here is the one related to magnetic monopoles. Because in our world, we don't have isolated magnetic poles, so certain terms in Maxwell's equations are zero or non-existent.

Let me recall each equation. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So in our universe, the divergence of B is zero (∇·B = 0), which is Gauss's Law for magnetism. This implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges, or monopoles. But in this parallel universe, the question says that magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So, that would mean that magnetic monopoles exist.

If magnetic monopoles exist, what happens to Maxwell's equations? Well, the Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would have a term related to the magnetic charge density. I think it would be something like ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes.

What about the other equations? Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) and Ampère's Law (∇×B = μ₀ J + ... )—do they change? Well, if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect how B behaves when you take the curl?

Wait, another thought. If we have magnetic monopoles, then Maxwell's equations would have to include terms for both electric and magnetic charges. So, not only would Gauss's Law for B change, but Faraday's Law would also change? Because with monopoles, maybe the curl of E isn't zero anymore in a certain situation.

Wait, no. Wait, Faraday's Law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. In our world, it's
