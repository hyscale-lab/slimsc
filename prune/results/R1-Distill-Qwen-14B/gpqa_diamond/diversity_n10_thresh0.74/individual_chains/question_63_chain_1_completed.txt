Alright, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule switching energy states. Hmm, okay, I remember from my chemistry class that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. And it's asking about the photon momentum needed to switch to the next lowest state.

Let me think. The molecule is X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s. Oh right, angular frequency is important for calculating energy levels.

So the problem is about absorption of a photon causing a transition. The next state with the lowest energy... I think that would be the next higher energy state, probably the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To go to the next state, you can either increase the rotational quantum number or the vibrational. But I'm not entirely sure which is lower in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule transitions from the v=0 level to v=1. Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized, and each vibrational transition is higher in energy. Rotational transitions are lower in energy than vibrational ones, but the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational motions. But when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which one has the lower energy increment? Because the next state with the lowest energy would require the photon to have the least possible energy, so the transition with the smallest energy difference.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (1/2) h w + (v + 1/2) h w. So the first vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) would involve an energy change of h w. For rotational transitions, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B (since E(1) - E(0) = B(2) - B(0) = 2B).

So which is smaller: h w or 2B? Because if 2B is smaller than h w, then the rotational transition would require less energy.

I think the vibrational frequency is usually higher than the rotational transitions. Let's calculate both.

First, find B, the rotational constant. B is given by h/(8 pi^2 I c), or wait, I think B is (h/(8 pi^2 I)) * something. Wait, I recall that the rotational energy levels are E = (h^2 / (8 pi^2 I)) * J (J + 1), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational constant B is h/(8 pi^2 I). So yeah, B = h/(8 pi^2 I). And I is the moment of inertia, which is mu * r^2, where mu is the reduced mass.

So, mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = approx 1.818 amu. Wait, 20 + 2 is 22, right. So 40 divided by 22 is 18.18/11, wait no, 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So mu = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.011e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.66 is roughly 3.01 (since 1.8 *1.66=2.988, plus 0.018*1.66=0.03, total about 3). So mu ≈ 3e-27 kg.

Wait, more accurately, let's compute 1.818 * 1.66e-27.

1.818 * 1.66 = let's compute 1.8 *1.66 = 2.988, 0.018 * 1.66=0.02988. Total is 3.01788. So approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Now, I = mu * r^2. The bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now B is h/(8 pi² I). Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.207e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈ 8*9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator part: 78.9568 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 78.9568 *1e-46 is 7.89568e-45? Wait, 1.207e-46 is 1.207 *1e-46. Multiply by 78.9568:

78.9568 * 1.207 ≈ let's see: 78 *1.2=93.6; 0.9568 *1.2=1.148; 78 *0.007=0.546; 0.9568 *0.007=0.0067. Summing all: 93.6 +1.148=94.748; +0.546=95.294; +0.0067=95.3007. So approximately 95.3, but that's 78.9568 *1.207 ≈ 95.3.

Wait, no, wait: 78.9568 * 1.207 = let's compute it accurately.

78.9568 *1 =78.9568, 78.9568 *0.2 =15.79136, 78.9568 *0.007=0.5526976.

Adding up: 78.9568 +15.79136 =94.74816 +0.5526976=95.3008576.

So denominator is 95.3008576e-46 kg m².

Wait, no, denominator is 8 pi² I, which is 78.9568 * I =78.9568 *1.207e-46 = (78.9568 *1.207) *1e-46.

Which is (approx 95.3008576) *1e-46 kg m².

So B =6.626e-34 / (95.3008576e-46) = 6.626e-34 / 9.53008576e-45.

Compute that:

6.626e-34 / 9.53e-45 = (6.626 /9.53) * 1e11. Because 1e-34 /1e-45=1e11.

6.626 /9.53 ≈ approx 0.695.

So B ≈ 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, wait, no. Because 6.626e-34 / 9.53e-45 = (6.626/9.53) *1e11, since 1e-34 / 1e-45 = 1e11.

6.626 /9.53 ≈ 0.695.

So B≈0.695e11 s⁻¹.

Wait, that's 6.95e10 rad/s.

Wait, but the angular frequency omega is given as 4e14 rad/s. So h*omega is the energy in the vibrational transition.

So, the energy for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is delta E_vib = h w.

E_vib = h * 4e14 = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would require delta E_rot = 2 B h.

Wait, no, E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) J (J+1). So delta E for J=0 to J=1 is E(1) - E(0) = (h²/(8 pi² I)) (2 - 0) = 2 h B.

Since B is h/(8 pi² I), so 2 h B = 2 * h * (h/(8 pi² I)) ) = (2 h² )/(8 pi² I) ) = h²/(4 pi² I).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels. The rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units (J). So when J increases by 1, the energy difference is 2B*(J+1), but for J=0 to J=1, it's 2B.

Wait, no: the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E(1) - E(0) = B (1)(2) - B(0)(1) )= 2B - 0 = 2B.

So the energy required for a rotational transition is 2B.

But B is in terms of energy. Let me calculate 2B.

Earlier, I found B ≈6.95e10 rad/s. So 2B = 1.39e11 rad/s?

Wait, no, B is in units of s⁻¹. So 2B would be 2 * 6.95e10 ≈ 1.39e11 s⁻¹.

Wait, but h is 6.626e-34 J s. So the energy for a rotational transition is E_rot = 2B h.

Wait, because E = h nu, where nu is frequency. But for rotational transitions, the energy is E = B J (J+1), which in terms of frequency would be something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, since B is h/(8 pi² I), for E_rot, the transition from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So the energy is 2B h.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The rotational energy levels are given by E = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E= (h²/(8 pi² I)) * 2.

So delta E = 2 * (h²/(8 pi² I)) ) = h²/(4 pi² I).

Alternatively, since B = h/(8 pi² I), then delta E = 2 B h.

Wait, because B is h/(8 pi² I), so delta E = 2 * (h/(8 pi² I)) * (h) )= 2 h^2/(8 pi² I) = h²/(4 pi² I).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. Let me compute both the vibrational and rotational energy differences and see which is smaller.

Vibrational delta E: h * w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 Hz. Wait, wait, the units for w are rad/s. So w=4e14 rad/s.

So h*w is 6.626e-34 J.s * 4e14 rad/s. But 1 rad is dimensionless, so J. So E_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Rotational delta E: 2*B*h. Because the transition is J=0 to J=1. So if B is in s⁻¹, then 2B * h.

Wait, B is h/(8 pi² I), so 2B*h = 2*(h/(8 pi² I)) * h = 2 h²/(8 pi² I).

But from earlier, I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So substituting I:

2 h²/(8 pi² I) = (2 * (6.626e-34)^2) / (8 pi² * 1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately 4.39e-67.

Multiply by 2: 8.78e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.207e-46.

8 pi² is about 78.9568. So 78.9568 *1.207e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So delta E_rot = 8.78e-67 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, that's way smaller than the vibrational delta E of 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational one. So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that allows it to transition to the next rotational state rather than the next vibrational state.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would either go to v=1, J=0 or J=1, v=0. Which transition requires less energy? From the calculations above, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would need to have the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but I'm getting delta E_rot as about 9.22e-23 J. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate delta E_rot.

B = h/(8 pi² I). I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² * 1.207e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * (pi^2) ≈ 78.9568.

Denominator = 78.9568 * 1.207e-46 = (78.9568 *1.207) * 1e-46.

78.9568 *1.207 ≈ 95.3 as before.

So denominator is 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.53e-45 ≈ 6.95e10 rad/s.

So delta E_rot = 2 * B * h. So 2 * 6.95e10 * 6.626e-34.

Wait, no, wait: E_rot = B * J (J+1). So J=0 to J=1: E=0 to B*(1)(2)=2B.

So delta E_rot = 2B.

But B is in units of rad/s, which is s^-1. So 2B = 2 *6.95e10 =1.39e11 s^-1.

Then, energy is E = h * (angular frequency) ? No, because in the rotational case, the energy levels are quantized based on the rotational constant.

Wait no, perhaps I should think of it differently. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) * J (J+1). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is delta E = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) * (2 - 0) = (2 h^2)/(8 pi^2 I) = h^2/(4 pi^2 I).

Alternatively, using B = h/(8 pi^2 I), so delta E_rot = 2 B h.

Wait, because B is h/(8 pi^2 I), so 2 B h = 2 * (h/(8 pi² I)) * h = (2 h^2)/(8 pi² I) = h^2/(4 pi² I), which matches the earlier expression.

So, substituting the numbers:

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

4 pi² I =4 * (pi^2) *1.207e-46 kg m².

pi² is ~9.87, so 4 *9.87=39.48.

39.48 *1.207e-46 ≈ 47.63e-46 =4.763e-45.

So delta E_rot =4.39e-67 / 4.763e-45 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, that's a very small energy compared to the vibrational transition of 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is way lower in energy.

So the molecule would need a photon that provides less energy, which is the rotational transition. So the photon's energy should be equal to delta E_rot, which is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. So knowing that E_photon = h f = p c, where p is momentum, since for photons, E = pc. So p = E/c.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.073e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) p = 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C)1.1e-27 Ns
D)1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 3e-31 kg m/s is 3e-31 N s, because 1 N s = 1 kg m/s. So 3e-31 Ns is way smaller than any options given. All options are about 1e-27 or higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the model considers both rotation and vibration together. So the transition might involve both a vibrational and a rotational change. Or perhaps the question is considering the next state as a combination of both.

Wait, another approach: the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both motions, and the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state, which could be either J=1, v=0, or v=1, J=0, whichever requires less energy.

As we saw earlier, the energy needed for J=1 is about 9.22e-23 J, and for v=1 it's 2.65e-19 J. So J=1 is much lower. So the molecule would transition to J=1, v=0.

So the photon energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is E/c. So:

p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 N s.

But options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of delta E_rot.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B = h/(8 pi² I) = 6.626e-34 / (8 pi² * 1.207e-46).

Wait, 8 pi² is about 78.9568.

So 8 pi² * I =78.9568 *1.207e-46 = let's compute 78 *1.207 =94.166, 0.9568 *1.207≈1.153. So total is approx 95.319e-46 =9.5319e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.5319e-45 = approximately 6.95e10 s⁻¹.

Wait, that's right. So delta E_rot = 2B h.

Wait, no, delta E is h * (2B). Because E = B J (J+1), so for J=1, E=2B. Since B is in terms of s⁻¹, but when multiplied by h (J s), E becomes J (joules).

So E_rot = h * 2B.

Wait, yes, because E = h * nu, and nu is B in terms of frequency.

Wait, no, B is the rotational constant, which has units of s⁻¹. So E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h? Or is E_rot = (h^2/(8 pi^2 I)) J (J+1)?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me think in terms of the formula.

E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So the energy is in joules.

So for J=0 to J=1, delta E is (h²/(8 pi² I)) * 2.

So plugging the numbers:

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I =8 * (9.8696) *1.207e-46 = 78.9568 *1.207e-46 =95.3e-46 =9.53e-45 kg m².

So delta E_rot = 4.39e-67 * 2 / 9.53e-45.

That is (8.78e-67) / (9.53e-45) = 9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p= E_photon / c =9.22e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are all about 1e-27 or higher. So none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, but perhaps to the next state in the rotational-vibration model, which involves both a change in vibration and rotation?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the next state as the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy h w.

Because in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized, and the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But the energy of these transitions depends on which transition requires less energy.

As previously calculated, the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

But according to the choices, the photon momentum is about 1e-27 or similar, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s. Let me compute what that would translate to in energy.

If p = 1e-27 kg m/s, then E = p c = 3e8 *1e-27 =3e-19 J. Wait, because E = pc for photons.

Wait, in the vibrational case, E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Which is about 2.65e-19 J. So p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is about 8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, and option A is 1.9e-28.

So 8.8e-28 would be close to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28) but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

h =6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value, as per SI).

w =4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h * w =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c =2.65042806e-19 / 3e8 =8.83476e-28 kg m/s =8.83476e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but that's significantly lower. Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the correct transition is the vibrational one.

Wait, but earlier calculations show the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So why are the options not matching?

Wait, perhaps the model used doesn't allow transitions to J=1 from J=0 unless another condition is met. Or perhaps I've messed up the calculation of the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition is the first vibrational state, and the rotational part is considered but the photon's energy is the same as the vibrational.

Wait, but the photon's momentum for the vibrational case would be about 8.8e-28 Ns, which is not exactly any of the options. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E_rot.

Wait, perhaps the problem treats the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the next state is the first rotational state (J=1) with v=0, and the energy is 2B, which is h*w_rot. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But earlier, I calculated B as about 6.95e10 rad/s, so 2B is ~1.39e11 rad/s. E_photon = h * 2B =6.626e-34 *1.39e11 =9.2e-23 J, which as before.

But then p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Maybe the energy levels for the molecule are modeled as both rotational and vibrational, and the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), requiring a photon of energy h w.

Which gives p = (h w )/c.

So let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which would be approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is much smaller, and option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.21 of the computed value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute that.

Compute B again.

mu = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

mu =1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

So I = mu * r^2 =3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I =3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

B = h/(8 pi² I) =6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator:8 pi² =78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =78.9568 *1.2068 = approx 95.3, so 95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 =6.95e10 rad/s.

So delta E_rot =2B h =2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34.

Wait, no, delta E_rot = E(1) - E(0) = B*(1)(2) -0 =2B.

But B is in units of s⁻¹, so 2B =1.39e11 s⁻¹.

So, E_rot = h * 2B =6.626e-34 *1.39e11 =9.2e-23 J.

As before, p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. Which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. So the required momentum is E/c = (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8.

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Divided by 3e8 m/s: 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.21 of this value, and option D is 1.4e-28, about 0.16.

Hmm. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute h*w correctly.

h =6.626e-34 J s, w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none is exactly this, but option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns.

Wait, 2.3e-27 is 2300e-28. Our computed value is 8.8e-28, which is about 4% of option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the transition is wrong, and the molecule is actually in the first excited state, but the question says fundamental state.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the combined rotational and vibrational energy levels. The next state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

But which one requires a smaller photon energy? As before, the rotational transition is less energetic, so the correct photon is for the rotational transition.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the model uses a different approach where the energy levels are considered as a sum of both rotational and vibrational, and the next state is the first excited state which could be either. But the question says 'the next state with the lowest possible energy', which would be the one requiring the least energy, which is the rotational transition.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the given options are for the vibrational transition, but perhaps the calculation is done using a different approach. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition. So the photon's energy is delta E_rot = 2B h.

Wait, but earlier calculation of delta E_rot is 9.22e-23 J, which would correspond to p=3.07e-31 Ns, which is not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is being calculated incorrectly. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for B. The correct formula for B is h/(8 pi^2 I), yes.

So I = mu * r^2. mu is (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34/(8 pi² *1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator:8 pi²=78.9568. 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =95.3e-46=9.53e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 =6.95e10 rad/s.

So delta E_rot=2B h=2 *6.95e10 *6.626e-34.

Wait, wait, no: delta E_rot is 2B, and E= h * 2B. Or is E=2B * h?

Wait, no, because B has units of s⁻¹, E_rot is J = B * J (J+1) * h.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy is E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = (h²/(8 pi² I)) * 2.

So E_rot = (h^2 * 2)/(8 pi² I) = (h^2)/(4 pi² I).

So delta E_rot = h^2/(4 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2≈4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.2068e-46 kg m².

So denominator is 4 pi² I =4 * (pi^2) *1.2068e-46.

pi^2 ≈9.8696.

4 *9.8696 ≈39.4784.

39.4784 *1.2068e-46 ≈47.63e-46=4.763e-45.

So delta E_rot =4.39e-67 /4.763e-45≈9.22e-23 J.

Again, same result.

So p =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns. Not in options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy including both rotational and vibrational, but the next state is the one with the lowest energy, which could be a combination. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of delta E_rot.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of w_rot, the rotational frequency.

Wait, w_rot is the rotational angular frequency, which is sqrt(k/I), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually considering a different model, like the rigid rotor, where the energy levels are E = (h²/(8 pi² I)) J (J+1), and the next state is J=1, so delta E_rot =2B h, where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it and transitions to the next state, which is the first allowed state, which could be a combination of rotation and vibration. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the rotational transition, but the options are way off.

Wait, the options are all in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns, which is about 1e-27 kg m/s.

Let me compute what energy that would correspond to.

Take option B: p=2.3e-27 Ns.

E = p c =2.3e-27 kg m/s *3e8 m/s=6.9e-19 J.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

So 6.9e-19 is about 2.6 times larger than h w.

So E_photon for option B would be higher than the vibrational transition.

Option C: p=1.1e-27 Ns. E=3.3e-19 J, which is about 1.24 times h w.

Option A: p=1.9e-28 Ns. E=5.7e-29 J. Way too low, much lower than both rotational and vibrational.

Option D: p=1.4e-28 Ns. E=4.2e-29 J. Also way too low.

Wait, so if I have to choose between the options given, the only one close to the vibrational transition is option A, but it's off by a factor of about 16.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the next state as the first vibrational state, and the photon's momentum is E_photon/c, which is 2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. The closest option is A (1.9e-28), but it's about four times smaller.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B more accurately.

Compute I:

mu = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22 ≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.66053906660e-27 kg.

mu =1.81818 *1.66053906660e-27 = approx 3.017e-27 kg.

I = mu * r^2 =3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

I=3.017e-27 *4e-20 =1.2068e-46 kg m².

B= h/(8 pi² I) =6.626e-34 / (78.9568 * 1.2068e-46).

Compute denominator:78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = (78.9568 *1.2068) *1e-46.

78.9568 *1.2068: Let me compute 78*1.2068 =94.2264; 0.9568 *1.2068≈1.154. Sum is 94.2264 +1.154=95.3804.

So denominator=95.3804e-46=9.53804e-45.

B=6.626e-34 /9.53804e-45 =6.95e10 rad/s.

So delta E_rot=2B h=2*(6.95e10)*6.626e-34 =9.21e-23 J.

p=9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the energy difference but the photon's momentum for the next state, which might involve both a vibrational and a rotational change. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule to transition to the next state when it's in the fundamental state, meaning v=0, J=0, and the next state is v=0, J=1. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But again, as before, that gives p=3.07e-31 Ns, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, and the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the calculation of the denominator when computing B.

Wait, let me recompute B.

B= h/(8 pi² I)

h=6.626e-34 J s.

8 pi² I=78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =?

78.9568 *1.2068 = let me compute accurately.

78 *1.2068 =94.0224.

0.9568 *1.2068: compute 0.9*1.2068=1.08612; 0.0568*1.2068≈0.0685. Sum:1.08612+0.0685=1.1546.

So total is 94.0224 +1.1546=95.177.

So 8 pi² I=95.177e-46=9.5177e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5177e-45.

6.626e-34 /9.5177e-45 =6.626 /9.5177 *1e11.

6.626 /9.5177≈0.696.

So B≈0.696e11 rad/s=6.96e10 rad/s.

Thus, delta E_rot=2B h=2 *6.96e10 *6.626e-34.

= (2 *6.96e10) *6.626e-34.

=13.92e10 *6.626e-34.

=13.92 *6.626e-24 =92.03e-24=9.203e-23 J.

Again, same as before. p=3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm.

Looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B (2.3e-27 Ns), which corresponds to E=6.9e-19 J. But that's about 2.6 times higher than the vibrational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the model.

Wait, the question states that the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. In this model, the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. But perhaps the exact treatment would involve a more complex calculation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and the next state is the first vibrational state. Then the photon's energy is h w.

So p= (h w)/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14 )/3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking for the closest option, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 0.21 of this value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B, but I can't figure out why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2? No, that's higher in energy. No, J=1 is the next state.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach to calculate B. Let me think: B is sometimes expressed as (h/(8 pi^2 I c)), but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is calculated using the formula B = (h²)/(8 pi² I k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is B = (h c)/(8 pi² I), but that would be in terms of wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are E = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹.

Wait, B in cm⁻¹ is given by (h c)/(8 pi^2 I), where I is in g cm².

Wait, maybe that's the confusion. Let me compute B in cm⁻¹.

I in g cm²: mu is 1.818 amu. 1 amu=1.6605e-24 g. So mu=1.818 *1.6605e-24 =3.017e-24 g.

r=2 angstroms =2e-8 cm.

I=mu * r^2=3.017e-24 g * (2e-8 cm)^2=3.017e-24 *4e-16=1.2068e-40 g cm².

Then, B (in cm⁻¹) = h c/(8 pi² I).

h=6.626e-34 J s. c=3e8 m/s=3e10 cm/s.

So h c=6.626e-34 *3e10=1.9878e-23 J cm.

I=1.2068e-40 g cm².

So B= (1.9878e-23) / (8 pi² *1.2068e-40 ).

Denominator:8 pi²=78.9568. 78.9568 *1.2068e-40=95.177e-40=9.5177e-39.

So B=1.9878e-23 /9.5177e-39≈2.087e15 cm⁻¹.

Which is in the same ballpark as w=4e14 rad/s. Wait, but cm⁻¹ is a different unit.

Wait, perhaps this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the photon's momentum to be calculated using the vibrational transition, which would be option A or D, but none match exactly.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the vibrational transition, and the options are miscalculated.

Wait, let me recompute p for the vibrational transition.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p=E/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s=8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, which is about 0.215 of this value. Not very close.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's wavelength.

E_photon_vib =2.65e-19 J.

E_photon_rot=9.22e-23 J.

But with the given options, none fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the molecule transitioning to the next vibrational state, but the photon's energy is not just h w but includes some other factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next rotational state (J=1), and the options are using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the momentum to be calculated as p = h/(lambda), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula p = sqrt(2 m E), but that's for particles in a box, not photons.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula E = (p^2)/(2 mu), but for photons, E=pc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the options and my calculations, the only possible conclusion is that the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A, which corresponds to the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct delta E is for the rotational transition, but in that case, none of the options match.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option B, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B because I made a miscalculation in the denominator for B.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of B.

Denominator:8 pi² I.

I=1.2068e-46 kg m².

8 pi²=78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =78.9568 *1.2068 =95.177, so 95.177e-46=9.5177e-45.

h=6.626e-34.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5177e-45=6.96e10 rad/s.

So E_rot=2B h=2*6.96e10 *6.626e-34=9.22e-23 J.

p=9.22e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

No, that's definitely not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, which would have p=8.83e-28 Ns. Since option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth, perhaps a miscalculation happened in the problem, or perhaps the intended answer is option B, but I can't justify it.

Given the time I've spent and the calculations, I think the correct approach is to choose the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.83e-28, which is closest to option A, but it's not matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(wavelength), and the wavelength is calculated from the transition energy.

But that's the same as E=pc, so same result.

Hmm. At this point, I think I've exhausted my approaches, and the only option that seems related to the vibrational transition is option A, but it's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But without further information, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the rotation transition is lower in energy, but none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which would be option A. But given that option A is about 1.9e-28 and my calculation is 8.8e-28, perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the reduced mass incorrectly. Wait, no, the reduced mass is used for the bond, which I did correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, which I converted correctly to meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, another approach: compute B in terms of frequency.

B=6.96e10 rad/s. What is that in terms of wavenumbers?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Given all this, I think the only viable option is that the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident. However, based on the calculations, the correct momentum is around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator for B.

Wait, 8 pi² I: I is 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² * I =78.9568 *1.2068e-46 =78.9568 *1.2068=95.177, so 95.177e-46=9.5177e-45 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5177e-45=6.96e10 rad/s.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the vibrational transition, and the options have a mistake. But without further information, I have to choose from the given options.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option B:2.3e-27 Ns, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, but option B is 2.3e-27, which is much larger than the calculated 8.8e-28 for the vibrational transition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would make it even larger.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Based on the calculations, the vibrational transition's momentum is around 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is option A:1.9e-28, but it's about four times smaller. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute E_photon_vib.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the only one in the same order of magnitude is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But neither is close. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't reconcile it with the calculations.

Given that, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is the vibrational transition, which corresponds to option A, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
   - Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
   - Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.017 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:
   The rotational constant \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I},
   \]
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \). Substituting:
   \[
   B = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \times 1.2068 \times 10^{-46}} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.53 \times 10^{-45}} \approx 6.96 \times 10^{10} \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]

5. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Rotational Transition (J=0 to J=1)**:
     The energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 6.96 \times 10^{10} \approx 1.39 \times 10^{11} \, \text{rad/s}.
     \]
     Converting to joules:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = h \cdot \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 1.39 \times 10^{11} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - **Vibrational Transition (v=0 to v=1)**:
     The energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \cdot \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]

6. **Photon Momentum**:
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - For the **rotational transition**:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - For the **vibrational transition**:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

7. **Comparison with Options**:
   The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( p_{\text{vib}} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is closest to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), though it is about four times smaller. None of the options match the rotational transition (\( p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)).

8. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the calculations, the vibrational transition is the most plausible scenario, and the closest option is **A**. However, the discrepancy suggests a possible issue with the problem's options or assumptions.

ANSWER: A
