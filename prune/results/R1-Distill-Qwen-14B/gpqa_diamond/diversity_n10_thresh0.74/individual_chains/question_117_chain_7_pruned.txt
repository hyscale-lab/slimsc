Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are not mirror images of each other because of the arrangement of atoms in space. Wait, no, optical isomers are enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. So the compound must have a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry that allows for such mirror images.

The question lists four compounds, 1 to 4, and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, so I need to check each one.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can have different isomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have either the same substituents on the same face (cis) or opposite (trans). But does that affect optical isomerism? Wait, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a non-superimposable mirror image. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Let's see, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each phenyl ring. Wait, the positions are 6,6' and 2,2' on the biphenyl. So each ring has two substituents. If the two substituents on each ring are in positions that are symmetrical... Wait, no, for biphenyls, the way substituents are arranged around the central single bond can lead to cis or trans isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. Wait, but optical isomerism requires a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. Let me think about the structure. The biphenyl has two methyl ester groups
