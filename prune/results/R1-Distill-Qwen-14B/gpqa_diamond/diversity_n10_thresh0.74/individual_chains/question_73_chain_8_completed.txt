Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, while astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. We need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed—oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like in classical mechanics. I remember that the formula for relative velocity involves the Lorentz factor. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Let me make sure I have that right. So, since both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be the difference in their speeds adjusted by the relativity formula.

So for the relative speed, let's plug in the numbers. V1 is 0.6c, and V2 is 0.5c. So the numerator becomes 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator would be 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that: 0.6*0.5 = 0.3, and when you divide by c², it becomes 0.3/c² * c² (since c²/c² is 1), so the denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which rounds to about 0.14c. So looking at the options, that would correspond to options C and D for the relative speed.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is given by gamma times m c squared. So for each, I need to calculate their individual energies and then sum them.

Let's compute each one's gamma. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. Then 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is gamma * m * c². But wait, A's mass is 2m, so energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: v = 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) which is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. B's mass is 3m, so energy is 1.1547 * 3m c². Let me compute that: 3 * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 mc².

Now, adding the two energies together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which matches our calculations. Option D says E=5mc², which is lower, so that's not right. Option B has a lower energy (4.96), which doesn't add up.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For Astronaut A:
- Mass \(m_A = 2m\), speed \(v_A = 0.6c\)
- Compute \(\gamma_A\):
  \[
  \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
  \]
- Energy of A:
  \[
  E_A = \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
  \]

#### For Astronaut B:
- Mass \(m_B = 3m\), speed \(v_B = 0.5c\)
- Compute \(\gamma_B\):
  \[
  \gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
  \]
- Energy of B:
  \[
  E_B = \gamma_B m_B c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
  \]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
