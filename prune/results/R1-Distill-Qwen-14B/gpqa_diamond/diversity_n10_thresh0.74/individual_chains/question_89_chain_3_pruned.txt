Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH to give product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break it down.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, to form an alkene. Because KOH is in excess and under heating, it's likely dehydrohalogenation. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules and form an alkene. But wait, wait. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have two bromines on adjacent carbons of the diamond structure.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—actually, in adamantane, each carbon is bonded to three others, right? So, the structure is a diamondoid, and the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. So when you eliminate two HBr, you're forming a double bond between those two carbons. But wait, wait, in such a structure, would elimination be possible? Because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantylene? Or something similar, but with a double bond.

Wait, but the product is also described as a light yellow solid. That makes me think
