Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about potentials in electromagnetism.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d which is the distance from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is later than tr.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. Specifically, E is the negative gradient of V minus the time derivative of A, and B is the curl of A.

But since the charge is moving, this becomes a bit more complicated. Oh right, when charges move, you need to consider retarded potentials because the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity in the past.

So the scalar potential V is given by the retarded Coulomb potential. The formula I remember is something like V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * [1/|r - r'|], where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time tr. But wait, the distance here is d. Oh, in the problem, d is the vector from the field generating point to r, so the distance is |d|, right? So the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ d), but wait, d is a vector. Oh, no, the magnitude. So perhaps V is q/(4πε₀ |d|).

Wait no, because in the problem, d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So the distance is |d|, but in the potential formula, it's 1 over the distance. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, I see some have 'r' and others have 'd'.

Wait, I need to think about the expression for the scalar potential. The scalar potential
