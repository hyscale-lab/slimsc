Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. 

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Hmm, wait, 1-bromo is the position, but what is the 'd' there? Oh, right, sometimes the 'd' refers to a deuterium. Oh, so maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine in position 1 and a deuterium (D) in position 2. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 2-bromo? Because 1-bromo-2-d would be a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium in the ortho position. So, it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.

So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and D at position 2. Now, when NaNH2 is used in a condensed ammonia solvent, which is a deprotonation agent. I think this might be a case of elimination or perhaps a substitution reaction.

Wait, but benzene is aromatic, so substitution would be an aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's removing a proton. Wait, but where are the protons available? The ring has Br and D in adjacent positions.

Wait, in benzene, each carbon has a hydrogen except where substituents are. So in
