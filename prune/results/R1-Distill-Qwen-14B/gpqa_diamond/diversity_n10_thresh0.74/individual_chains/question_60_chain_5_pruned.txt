Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. But the question is about how long it takes for their 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their point of view.

Wait, the options are given, and one of them suggests the astronaut will die before reaching Earth. Hmm. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip should take less time because of the effects of traveling at such a high speed.

But wait, how do I calculate this? I think I need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame (the stationary frame), and t' is the time measured in the spacecraft's frame (the moving frame, so the astronaut's perspective).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is shorter than the
