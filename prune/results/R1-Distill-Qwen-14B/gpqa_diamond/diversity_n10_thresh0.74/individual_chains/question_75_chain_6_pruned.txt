Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically about a transgenic mouse model. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're modifying the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then, they're using Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After selecting the antibiotic-resistant colonies, they test the expression but can't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the problem, the issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. The question provides the plus strand sequence of the construct. I need to look for possible issues in this sequence that would prevent proper expression.

Let me think about possible reasons why the protein isn't being expressed. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, maybe the HA tag is wrong, leading to no expression. But wait, does the HA tag matter for expression or just for purification? If the tag is messed up, perhaps the affinity purification wouldn't work, but the question says they tried to overexpress and couldn't. So maybe the issue is in the coding sequence affecting the expression, like a premature stop codon or something.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. So, a premature stop codon. That would cause the protein to be truncated, but the question says the protein isn't expressed as expected. Wait, if the ribosome stops early, you get a shorter protein, but perhaps not a complete absence. Or maybe the construct doesn't include a start codon, so the ribosome doesn't start at all.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If there's no linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G, maybe the proteases are cleaving the protein. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If it's right before the start codon, maybe the construct doesn't have an appropriate signal. Or perhaps the missing linker makes the protein unstable, leading to degradation. So the protein is made but quickly broken down, which would explain low expression.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. So if the mouse's tRNA doesn't have it, that's not possible because all cells have the standard stop codons. Wait, no, the question says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. But wait, UAA is a stop codon, and in all standard translation, the ribosome recognizes it as a stop. So if the mouse's tRNA for UAA is missing, but that's a stop codon, it's probably not an issue because the ribosome stops at UAA anyway. So why would that matter? Maybe if the construct has a UAA in the middle that is supposed to be a codon, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking at the construct's sequence, maybe I should examine it for possible stop codons. The plus strand is given as a long DNA sequence. Let me find the start and see if any stop codons appear.

The sequence starts with 'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC... So the first ATG is the start codon (methionine). Let me scan for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).

First, let me write the coding sequence, breaking it down into triplets.

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CC GAA AGC AAG GCT GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGC GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCC GGC GTT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT TCT GCT GCG AGA AC CAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGG CGA TGT GCA GCG GCT GGC GGC CTA CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA CTG CAT CCT CAT TTC GAA CCC CAA CGA GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTT GCG AGA AGC CGC AGC GTT AA C GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in frame.

Looking at the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAT CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CC GAA AGC AAG GCT GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGC GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCC GGC GTT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GCT GGG CGA TGT GCA GCG GCT GGC GGC CTA CGT GGG CGC CGG CGA GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTC GCA CTG CAT CCT CAT TTC GAA CCC CAA CGA GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCT GTT TTT GCG AGA AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, in the first part, after the start codon ATG, the next is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAT (tyrosine), CGA (arg), TGT (cys), TCA (ser), GAT (as), TAC (tyr), GCC (ala), AAA (lys), TGA (stop).

Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So after the start codon, the sixth codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be read as ATG TAC CCA TAT CGA TGT TCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So
