Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those like coherent states or squeezed states, and non-Gaussian states have more complicated structures, like cat states.

The given state is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N. Wait, and N is the normalization constant given by sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Oh right, because when you compute the norm, you square the sum: |cos(φ)|² + |sin(φ)|² + cross terms which involve sin(2φ) exp(-2α²), I think.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity nG, which is computed as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the given state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but how do I find tau? The reference is a Gaussian state. For a cat state, the reference Gaussian state is perhaps the closest Gaussian state to it. Or maybe for the relative entropy, it's the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the closest Gaussian state to the cat state.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is defined as the relative entropy between the given state and the closest Gaussian state. So, tau would be that closest Gaussian state.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference might be a specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state with certain parameters.

Wait, but I'm not too familiar with the exact steps to compute this. Let's think about the steps I need to take.

First, I need to write the density matrix rho for the state |ψ>.

The state is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N.

So rho = |ψ><ψ|.

Expanding that, rho will have terms involving |α><α|, |α><-α|, |-α><α|, and |-α><-α|. Since |α> and |-α> are coherent states, which are Gaussian, their outer products are Gaussian. But the cross terms might introduce non-Gaussian features
