Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that when a liquid can decolorize bromine water, it usually means it has some unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated groups which can undergo addition reactions with Br2. So mixture X probably contains alkenes or something similar.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum under heat, a new mixture Y is formed. Mixture Y is the result of a disproportionation reaction, and it's equimolar as well. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, that's interesting. So if Y doesn't react with bromine, that suggests it doesn't have any double bonds (or conjugated systems) anymore. Maybe the alkenes in X have been converted into something else.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z. So when they add hydrogen, both X and Y become Z. And Z is a solvent widely used, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a fully saturated molecule, no more double bonds.

What's the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z? It's 14.28%. Let me calculate what that might be. So the percentage is approximately 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7. So if I think of a molecule where the mass contributed by hydrogen is 1/7, let's think about possible hydrocarbons.

Wait, the formula for percentage composition: (mass of H / molar mass) * 100% = 14.28%. Let me consider possible hydrocarbons. Let's assume Z is an alkane because it's fully saturated. Let's see:

If Z is CH3CH2CH2CH3 (butane), the molar mass is 58 g/mol (12*4 + 1*10). Wait, wait, wait, butane is C4H10. So the percentage of H is (10/(58)) *100 ≈ 17.24%, which is a bit higher than 14.28. Hmm.

What about hexane? C6H14. Molar mass is (6*12)+(14*1) =72+14=86. H mass is 14, so (14/86)*100 ≈16.28%. Still not close enough.

Wait, maybe it's a smaller molecule. Let's try ethane, C2H6. Molar mass is 30. H mass is 6/30 = 20%. Closer, but not 14.28.

What about propane, C3H8? Molar mass is 46. (8/46)*100 ≈17.39%, still higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic compound or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's
