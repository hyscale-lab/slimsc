Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars, same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. 

So, the RV method gives the velocity of the star (V). The formula I remember is something like V = (G * (M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) * (1/(period))^(1/3) * ... Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between velocity and period.

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( ( sin i ) / ( (P * (2π))^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) ) ) )

But since both planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_planet << M_star. So we can approximate M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, I think the key equation is the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). Since the mass of the planet is the same (both are Neptune-like), but their K values are different, the ratio of K's should relate to the ratio of (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet))^(something) multiplied by another factor involving the period.

Wait, perhaps a simpler way is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is K = (v) which depends on the mass of the planet, the period, the distance between them, and the inclination.

Wait, the formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P * (2π))^(1/3) )

But since M_planet << M_star, then M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So:

K ≈ [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P * (2π))^(1/3) )

Simplifying, since sin i is likely ~1 (assuming edge-on orbits, which gives maximum K), and assuming e is negligible (circular orbits): denominator terms (1 - e²)^(1/2) ≈1.

So K ≈ ( ( G * M_planet )^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/( (2π P)^(1/3) ) )

Let me rearrange this. Let's cube both sides
