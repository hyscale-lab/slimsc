Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make those infinities manageable so you can renormalize the theory. But some theories don't need regularization because they don't have these problems, or maybe they're free from such divergences.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations, right? It's a classical theory, not quantum. So in classical E&M, you don't have the same issues with divergent integrals because you're not dealing with the same kind of loop diagrams or virtual particles. But wait, do you get any infinities in classical theories? I think in classical E&M, you have things like the infinite self-energy of a point charge, the infinite electromagnetic field at the charge's location. But those are handled differently than in quantum theories. Wait, but the question is about regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So in classical theories, you wouldn't use regularization. So if the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization, classical E&M wouldn't need it because it's not part of the quantum framework. Or maybe the question is about whether the theory itself is free from requiring such techniques because of other reasons.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory doesn't have divergences, it won't need regularization. Which of these theories are free of divergences?

Option C is QED. I know QED is a well-behaved theory. It's a gauge theory with a positive beta function, meaning the coupling constant decreases at high energies. I think QED is a renormalizable theory, which means you can handle the divergences with renormalization. But wait, does it require regularization? Well, yes, because you need to regularize the infinities before you can renormalize. So QED does require regularization, but it's renormalizable so it works out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
