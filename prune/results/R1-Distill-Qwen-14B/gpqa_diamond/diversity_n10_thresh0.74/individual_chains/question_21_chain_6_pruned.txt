Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in geometric or optical isomerism.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Which compound doesnâ€™t show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, resulting in a different structure. For example, keto-enol tautomerism is common in compounds with adjacent ketone and enol groups. So I need to check if each compound can undergo such a shift.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has a structure where two hydroxyl groups are on a benzene ring, but wait, no, actually, quinones have ketone groups. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups (O double bonds) in the para positions. So its structure is O=C6H4=O. Now, can it undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism would require a hydrogen adjacent to an oxygen where the double bonds are. In benzoquinone, each ketone is attached to the benzene, but I don't see any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups because the carbons are connected to the ring. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any H's on the carbonyl carbons, so no enol formation. So no tautomerism for benzoquinone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbons is double-bonded to oxygen. Now, looking for possible tautomerism. Each carbonyl group has two adjacent carbons. Wait, the ring carbons are each connected to two other carbons and an oxygen. Are there any hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbons? Let me imagine the structure. The ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon connected to a ketone would have two other ring carbons attached. So each of those positions is a carbonyl carbon (C=O), so each of those would have two other ring CH2 groups attached. Wait, no, if it's 1,3,5-trione, then each of those positions (like C1) is a carbonyl group, so it's (O=C) connected to two other carbons in the ring. So those carbonyl carbons would each have two ring carbons attached. So each of those positions would not have any hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon because they're double-bonded to O. Wait, but can they have any H's attached elsewhere?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The structure is a cyclohexane ring where each of the 1,3,5 positions are carbonyl groups (O double bonds). So each of those carbons is C=O, and the other two bonds are to adjacent carbons in the ring. So each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two other ring carbons, and the double bond to O. So each of those carbons doesn't have any H's attached because all four bonds are used (double bond to O, two single bonds to adjacent carbons). Therefore, the molecule would be O=C-Ring-C=O-Ring-C=O and so on. So, no H's on the carbonyl carbons, so no possibility for enol tautomerism. Hmm, but wait, is there any possibility of keto-enol tautomerism in the ring? Maybe if the structure allows for some hydrogen movement between the carbonyl and an adjacent position. Alternatively, maybe there's another kind of tautomerism, like in the case of a diketone that can form an enol.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Could it undergo some kind of tautomerism? I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about benzoquinone again. Benzoquinone is two ketones on a benzene ring. Since the ring is fully conjugated, each ketone is adjacent to two other carbons which are part of the aromatic ring. In that case, there's no H's on the carbonyl carbons. So no tautomerism.

But what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Each carbonyl is in a six-membered ring, and perhaps the ring's structure allows for some tautomerism. Wait, wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups, each at alternate positions. So, maybe the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because there's no hydrogen on the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is fully conjugated, making the structure stable and unable to shift.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds can have enols? Enols require a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So if the carbonyl carbon doesn't have any H's, tautomerism isn't possible.

Benzoquinone: the carbonyl carbons are attached to the benzene ring, which is at the para positions. So each carbonyl is part of a ketone group attached to the benzene. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (i.e., the ring carbons) do have H's, but those are not directly attached to the carbonyl. Wait, in benzoquinone, each of the
