Okay, so I need to solve this question about a transgenic mouse model and gene expression. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. The setup is that they inserted a sequence for the GADD45G gene into a plasmid, modified it to include an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

Looking at the DNA sequence they provided, I should check for any obvious issues that would prevent the protein from being expressed correctly. The options given are A to D, so I'll need to evaluate each possible issue.

The sequence given is the plus strand, which is the coding (sense) strand. Let's break it down.

First, I should look for the start codon. The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. That's good.

Next, I should check the reading frame. Let's see the first few codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GC... Wait, let me write these out:

ATG (M)
TAC (Y)
CCA (P)
TAC (Y)
GAT (D)
GTA (V)
TCC (S)
AGA (R)
TTA (L)
CGC (R)
CAA (Q)
ATG (M)
ACT (T)
CTG (L)
GAA (E)
GAA (E)
TCC (S)
GCG (A)
GCC (A)
AGG (R)
ACA (T)
CAG (Q)
TTA (L)
CGG (R)
AAA (K)
GCA (A)
... etc.

Wait, but the first codon is ATG, which is correct. But after that, the next codons are TAC, CCA, etc. So the reading frame is correct. No early stop codons, I think.

Wait, but wait a second. The plasmid was modified to include the HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is from influenza and is a small peptide, like YPYDHHVYLD. But in the DNA, the HA tag would be added as a sequence upstream of the GADD45G coding sequence.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, the start codon, which suggests that maybe the HA tag is included in this sequence. Wait, but HA is a tag, so perhaps the construct is supposed to have the HA tag at the beginning. Let me think about how that would look.

The HA tag's DNA sequence would be something like: ATG GCT ACT TCA CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT GCT GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT CCA GCT TCA GCT TCA GCT TCA
