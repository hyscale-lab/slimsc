Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let me try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does that happen? I think dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, right? So when a spot covers part of the surface, it makes the overall brightness (and hence effective temperature) decrease because those spots are emitting less light.

But wait, the effective temperature is a measure of the total luminosity, right? The star's total luminosity comes from the sum of all the flux from its surface. So when 40% is covered by spots, the average temperature must drop. But the question is about how this affects the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels.

The ratio in question is the number of Ti atoms in level 1 compared to level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher, and when it does have spots, it's lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. I'm not sure about the exact significance, but probably it's about the ionization or excitation state of Ti.

The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the two levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio is n1/n2. Because the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when spots are present, Teff is lower, and that must affect the ratio.

Wait, let me make sure. The ratio is (n1)/(n2) when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the ratio is inversely proportional to the exponential term. Because if T is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is smaller, making n2/n1 smaller. So n1/n2 would be larger when T is higher. Wait, no:

Wait, n2/n1 =
