Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variation, right? I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. The gravity of another planet affects the timing, so they can detect it that way.

The question gives me some ratios: first, the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's, or the other way around? Hmm, equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. The formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, d is distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that term is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance. Let me think: T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) because when you rearrange the formula, T is proportional to sqrt(L/(d^2)). Wait no, more accurately, T is proportional to [(L(1 - a))/(d^2)]^(1/4). So the temperature ratio would be ( (T1)/(T2) ) = ( (d2/d1) )^(-1/2), because T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4). Wait, let me get that right.

If T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, and T2 that of Planet2, then T1/T2 = ( (L1 (1 - a1))/(d1^2) )^(1/4) / ( (L2 (1 - a2))/(d2^2) )^(1/4 ). But wait, the problem says all have the same albedo, so a1 = a2 = a3 = 0.3. So (1 - a)
