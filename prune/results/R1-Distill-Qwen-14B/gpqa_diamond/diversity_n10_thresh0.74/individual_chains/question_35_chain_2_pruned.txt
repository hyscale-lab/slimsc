Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay, is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). We're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like Sx, Sy, Sz are related to spin matrices. For spin-½ particles, these matrices are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms.

The σy matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Which matches the matrix S given here. So S is the Pauli y-matrix. So, S = σy.

So Ay = c * S, with c = h/(4π). So substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay. I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator like S are ±ħ/2. Wait, but S here is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1 for σy. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, the spin matrices (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because for spin-½ particles, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ. So if S is σy, then the actual spin operator Sy would be (ħ/2)σy. But in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S, which is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, right? So h = 2πħ. So h/(4π) is (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2). So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. So that's the same as the spin operator Sy for a spin-½ particle.

Wait no, wait: Wait, the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So yes, because c = h/(
