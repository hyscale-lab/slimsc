Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)](dx² + dy²). So this looks like a two-dimensional metric in terms of x and y. Wait, isn't the pseudosphere a two-dimensional surface? Or is it embedded in three dimensions? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe it's represented in isothermal coordinates or something like that.

I recall that the metric for a pseudosphere can be written in terms of its radius. The general form, I think, is something like ds² = (2r/(R² - r²(x² + y²)))² (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. Oh right, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(1 - (x² + y²))²)(dx² + dy²). So comparing that with the given metric, let's see.

Wait, the given metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So if I rewrite that, it's 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). The Poincaré disk model has 4/(1 - (x² + y²))². So maybe the given metric is similar but scaled
