Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the angle subtended at the Earth by the star's apparent shift in position as seen from two points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance d (in parsecs) is 1 over parallax plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. 

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So they're asking how the number density of stars changes with parallax. Oh right, because stars are spread out in space. The more distant stars are fewer in number because they're spread out more.

Wait, let me think. If the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, how does this translate into the number per unit parallax range?

Hmm, let's break it down. Let's say the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area of the shell. Since the volume between two spherical shells is 4πd²Δd, and the number of stars in that volume would be n * 4πd²Δd, where n is the number density.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx. Let me denote plx as p for simplicity. So d = 1/p. Then, when plx changes by Δp, what does that mean for d? I think we need to find the number
