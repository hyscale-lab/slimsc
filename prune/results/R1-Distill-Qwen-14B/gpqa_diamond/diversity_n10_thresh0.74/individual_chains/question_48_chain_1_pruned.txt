Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what the question is about. Hmm. The problem involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and going through several steps. The question is about determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, product 4.

Alright, let me break it down step by step. I'll start by writing down each reaction step and figure out what each product is.

The first step is cyclohexanone treated with bromine to form product 1. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, I think it's a type of addition reaction. Wait, bromine can undergo various reactionsâ€”like addition in alkenes, but here it's a ketone. Oh right, in the presence of a ketone, bromine can add via the acid-catalyzed mechanism, probably leading to the formation of a dibromide. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, I think it's a ketone bromination. Alternatively, maybe it's a ene reaction or addition. Maybe it's a halohydrin formation? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a ketone reacts with bromine, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition of Br across the carbonyl group.

Wait, cyclohexanone's structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Adding brom
