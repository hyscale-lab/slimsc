Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, we're looking for the right equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1 (the number in the higher level) over n2 (lower?) is 2. Or wait, no. Wait, the energy levels are specific; I think the higher energy level would have fewer atoms, but maybe not. Wait, if the energy level is higher, it's less populated because it's harder to get to. So if star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as star_2, maybe that specific level is higher in energy than the lower level.

Wait, no, the specific energy level— wait, the problem says "a specific energy level was twice as excited." So perhaps the ratio of the number of atoms in a particular energy level E1 and E2 (maybe E2 is the lower level) is n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the same energy level in each star. Oh wait, the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for that same energy level, the population is higher in star_1.

Wait, but the energy difference is given. So perhaps the energy levels are the same for both stars, but the excitation depends on temperature. So for the same energy levels, the ratio of populations depends on the temperatures.

Wait, let's model this. Let me denote E as the energy difference between two levels. So for each star, the ratio of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to the ground state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star 1, n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -E/(k*T1) )
Similarly for star 2, n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -E/(k*T2) )

But the problem states that n1_upper / n2_upper is 2. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the populations in the same energy level between the two stars. So for the same energy level E, n1(E) / n2(E) = 2.

Wait, but the Boltzmann distribution depends on the temperature. So perhaps the ratio of the populations in the same energy level for the two stars is given by the ratio of their Boltzmann factors. Wait, no, no. Because the same energy level would have a population determined by the terms involving the degeneracy and the exponential term.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the number of atoms in a specific energy level i is given by:

n_i = (g_i / Q) ) * exp( -E_i/(k T) )

where g_i is the degeneracy, and Q is the partition function.

But for two stars, star 1 and star 2, the ratio of the number of atoms in energy level E in each star would be:

n1(E) / n2(E) = [ (g_E / Q1) exp(-E/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_E / Q2) exp(-E/(k T2)) ) ]

Assuming that E is the same for both stars, and since g_E is the same (same element, same energy level), the g_E terms cancel out. So the ratio becomes (Q2/Q1) * exp( [ (E/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ratio of the same energy level in each star, but perhaps we can make an approximation, assuming that the partition functions Q1 and Q2 are similar, or perhaps the effect is dominated by the exponential terms.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio given is n1_upper / n2_upper = 2, but considering the same energy level, the ratio would be based on the temperatures. Alternatively, if the energy levels are the same, the ratio between the two stars would relate to the temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of their excitation. So the ratio of the excitation (population) in star_1 to star_2 is 2. Let me denote x as the population in the upper level for each star.

So x1 = 2 x2.

But each x is given by x = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no, the ratio of upper to lower is (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but in this problem, perhaps the lower level is the same for both stars, so the ratio for each star is:

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But since the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, perhaps the ratio of the upper to lower is 2 in star_1, and something else in star_2.

Wait, but the question states that the energy difference is given, 1.38e-23 J. So maybe the ratio of the populations is based on the same energy difference, so for each star, the ratio of upper to lower is different.

Wait, so for star_1, (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, star_2: (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = (g_upper/g_lower) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, but which energy level? It says in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in the upper level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n_upper / n_lower depends on the exponential term. But if we're comparing the same energy level in the two stars, maybe the ratio is due to the temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the populations in the same energy level is the same as the ratio of the Boltzmann factors. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is:

n_upper1 / n_upper2 = [ (g_upper / Q1) exp(-E_upper/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_upper / Q2) exp(-E_upper/(k T2)) ) ]

Assuming that Q1 and Q2 are similar, perhaps we can ignore them, leading to:

n_upper1 / n_upper2 = exp( [ E_upper/(k) ] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But E_upper is the same for both stars because it's the same energy level. Let me denote E as the energy of the upper level. So,

n_upper1 / n_upper2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

But according to the problem, n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. So,

2 = exp( (E/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides,

ln(2) = (E/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy E is ΔE, which is E_upper - E_lower. Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, we have E_upper - E_lower, which is the same as ΔE.

Wait, but in the expression I have above, it's E/(k T), but E should be ΔE, the energy difference between the two levels. So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making it more complicated than it needs to be. Let me re-express that equation.

Let me rearrange the equation:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Wait, wait, no, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), so:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But the question is about the equation involving T1 and T2. Let me see the options given.

Looking back, the options are:

A) ln(2) = T2/T1

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( (T1 T2)^2 )

D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So comparing, my derived equation is:

ln(2) = ( ΔE/(k) ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k in them. So perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that (ΔE/(k)) is some value that can be arranged into the equation.

Wait, but perhaps in this problem, the ratio is n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. So using the Boltzmann equation:

n_upper1 / n_upper2 = ( (g_upper / Q1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) / ( (g_upper / Q2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Simplifying, assuming g_upper and Q are same (or their ratio is 1), then:

(n_upper1)/(n_upper2) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So,

ln(n_upper1 / n_upper2 ) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Given that n_upper1 = 2 n_upper2,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, 1/T2 -1/T1 = -(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [ -(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

So,

ln(2) = - (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, but the options don't have a negative sign. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me re-examine the exponents. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio n_upper1 / n_upper2 is:

[exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which is equal to exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So,

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, if (ΔE/k) equals 1, then this equation would match option D. But the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what (ΔE)/(k) is.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So,

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So, ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

So, (ΔE)/(k) = 1 K.

So, substituting back into our equation:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{upper}} \) and \( n_{\text{lower}} \) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the populations in the same energy level is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{upper,2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( n_{\text{upper,1}} / n_{\text{upper,2}} = 2 \), taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
