Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some sort of immune response process. Hmm, let me try to unpack it slowly.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they saw that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which would break down proteins, I guess. But some made it through and got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs.

Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, right? So they isolated the fluorescent Peyer's patches and looked at the proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and saw high variability. So what process is happening here?

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each process.

VDJ recombination is part of the initial formation of B cell receptors, right? It's during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. The V, D, J gene segments are joined to form the variable region. But once the B cell is mature, this process stops.

Somatic hypermutation, or SHM, occurs in the germinal centers, which is part of the adaptive immune response. This process introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This happens after the initial immune response is triggered, allowing for affinity maturation.

Class switching recombination, or CSR, is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG) without changing the variable region. This is also in the germinal centers, so it's part of the same process as SHM but affects the constant region.

Complement activation is more about the complement system's role in attacking pathogens, maybe via opsonization or creating holes in the membrane. Not directly about the genes of the B cells changing.

So in the scenario, the rotavirus proteins are being taken up by the immune system. The mice's B cells are responding. The fact that the variable heavy chain has high variability suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that increases the diversity of their receptors.

Wait, the GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. When the mice eat them, the proteins are probably processed, maybe in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, like the Peyer's patches. The B cells there take up the antigen, present it, and then their receptors are getting diversified.

But in the question, the variable heavy chain has high variability. So what process leads to that? VDJ is during initial development, but if the B cells are already mature, then VDJ wouldn't be happening. They would be undergoing somatic hypermutation instead.

So when the B cell is activated, in the germinal centers, they undergo SHM, which creates all that variability. That would explain the high variability in the variable regions when you sequence them.

Wait, but why is the variable region variable? Because after activation, each B cell's receptor gets hypermutated, leading to a diverse population. So sequencing the variable heavy chain would show a lot of different sequences, hence high variability.

So the process in question is somatic hypermutation. So the answer is A.

Other options: B) complement activation doesn't change B cell gene sequences. C) class switching affects the type of antibody but not the variable regions. D) VDJ is earlier in development. So yes, A must be the right answer.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence is partially destroyed by stomach acid, and the remaining GFP is entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, suggesting a process that increases the diversity of B cell receptors.

To determine the correct process:

- **VDJ recombination (Option D)** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. This process is completed during maturation and does not explain the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain after maturation.

- **Class switching recombination (Option C)** involves changing the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable region. This process affects the constant region of the antibody and does not explain the variability in the variable heavy chain.

- **Complement activation (Option B)** is a part of the innate immune response and does not involve changes to the B cell receptor's genetic sequence.

- **Somatic hypermutation (Option A)** occurs in germinal centers during the adaptive immune response, where mutations are introduced into the variable region of the B cell receptor. This process increases the diversity of the antibody repertoire and matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
