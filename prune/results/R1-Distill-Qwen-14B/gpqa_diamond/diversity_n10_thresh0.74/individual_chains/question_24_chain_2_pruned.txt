Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again and jot down the key points.

The problem involves two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. Here's what I understand:

1. **Mixture X**: It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Oh wait, the reaction is a disproportionation, so that means one of the reactants is both oxidized and reduced. Also, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means it has double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, that can undergo addition reactions with Br2.

2. **Mixture Y**: This is the product after X is treated with Pt and heated. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and it doesn't decolorize bromine water. That might mean that whatever reaction happened in X led to structures without double bonds, or perhaps the double bonds are converted into something else that doesn't react with bromine. Wait, but the problem says that in mixture X, there are no conjugated double bonds. Hmm, so maybe the reaction is something like an addition or a rearrangement?

3. **Hydrogenation**: Both X and Y are hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, leading to only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. We need to find Z's formula. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. And Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a saturated compound, like an alkane.

So, the goal is to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me break this down.

First, since X is a mixture of two equimolar liquids that decolorizes bromine water, they must have double bonds (but no conjugated ones, as per the problem statement). So each component of X is probably an alkene, maybe with isolated double bonds.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, a disproportionation occurs. Disproportionation reactions typically involve a single element changing its oxidation state. For example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, oxygen goes from -1 to 0 and -2
