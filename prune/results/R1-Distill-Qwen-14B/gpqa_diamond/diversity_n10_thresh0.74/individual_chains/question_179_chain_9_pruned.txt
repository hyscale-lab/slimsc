Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators. Observables, like energy or position, are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is usually a unitary matrix. So I need to look at each matrix and figure out their properties.

First, let's look at each matrix.

Matrix W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Wait, is W Hermitian? For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. W's elements are all real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. The transpose of W is same as W itself because it's symmetric. So W is Hermitian, which means it's an observable.

Matrix X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Wait, let me check if X is Hermitian. The (1,2) element is -1, and the (2,1) is 1. So X's conjugate transpose would have (1,2) as 1 and (2,1) as -1. So let's compute X†.

X† would have:
- i*, 1*, (2i)*
(-1)*, 0*, (-1)*
(2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* 

Wait, i is imaginary unit. So X's first row is [i, -1, 2i], so the conjugate would be [-i, -1, -2i]. So the first row of X† is [-i, 1*, (2i)*]?

Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully.

X's elements are:
X_11 = i
X_12 = -1
X_13 = 2i
X_21 = 1
X_22 = 0
X_23 = 1
X_31 = 2i
X_32 = -1
X_33 = -i

So X† is the conjugate transpose. So first row of X† is the conjugate of X's first column.

X's first column is [i, 1, 2i], so conjugate is [-i, 1, -2i].

Similarly,
