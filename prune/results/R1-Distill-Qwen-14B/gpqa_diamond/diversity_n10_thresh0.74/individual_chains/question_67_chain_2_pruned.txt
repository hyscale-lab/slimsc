Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have a quantum number l=1, right? So each electron has l1 and l2 both equal to 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be l1 + l2 or |l1-l2|, right? So for two electrons each with l=1, possible total l values are 0, 1, 2. So the state here is l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each Lz has eigenvalues mℏ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, L1z is m1 ℏ, L2z is m2 ℏ.

But wait, the state given is a coupled state, not the product state. So the coupled state is |l1, l2, l, m>, which is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But the individual m1 and m2 can vary as long as m1 + m2 = m_total.

Wait, I'm supposed to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -ħ. So each L_zi has eigenvalues mi ℏ. So for each electron to have L_zi = -ħ, their mi must be -1. Because -1 * ħ is the eigenvalue. So m1 and m2 both are -1.

But in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. But if both were -1, their sum would be -2, which is not equal to -1. That's a problem. So there's no way that in this state, both electrons have m=-1.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the state. Let me think again. The state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So for this state, the total angular momentum is L=2, and its z-component is M=-1. So when we measure L1z and L2z, which are the individual angular momenta, their sum should be M = -1.

So for each electron, m1 and m2 can be any numbers such that m1 + m2 = M = -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) could be (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-2), (-2,1), etc., but wait, no—because each has l=1, so their m can only be -1, 0, or +1. So possible pairs are (m1, m2)= (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,-2)—wait, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So only
