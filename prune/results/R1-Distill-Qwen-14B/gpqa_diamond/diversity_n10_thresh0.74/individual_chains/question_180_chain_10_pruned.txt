Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. They have negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I'm thinking about electrostatic potential energy here. Because the particles are identical and have charge, the energy must be related to their arrangement. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, which is where the others are arranged around. The rest are at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Wait, but each of these 12 charges is at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at P, and the others are arranged, perhaps in a spherical shell around it, each 2 meters away? But since it's an isolated system, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point 2 meters away from P, but that would cause them to be very close to each other, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps they're arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances from each other are negligible or considered in another way.

Wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so maybe they're all at the same point 2 m away from P? Or maybe arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m. But for the potential energy, perhaps their mutual distances don't matter as much as their distances from the fixed charge at P.

So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 m from P, each of the 12 charges would contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The potential energy of a charge in an electric field is given by U = qφ, where φ is the potential at the location of the charge. So, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P. So, the potential at each of the 12 charges due to the
