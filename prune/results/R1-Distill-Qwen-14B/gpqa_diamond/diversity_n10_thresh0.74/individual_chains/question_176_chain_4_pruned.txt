Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

So, the question is about measuring observables P and Q on a given state vector. I remember that when you measure an observable, the outcome is an eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. But wait, since we're measuring P first and then Q, I need to think about how the state changes each time.

The state vector at time t is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Oh wait, maybe the vector is (-1, 2, 1) and it's a row vector? Hmm, no, the question says it's a column matrix, so it's a column vector. But I'll have to normalize it because the probabilities need to sum to 1.

First, let me find the norm of the state vector. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So the components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1].

Wait, wait. Or maybe the vector is already a column vector, and we just need to normalize it before proceeding. So I should probably write it as a column and divide each element by sqrt(6).

But before I go into that, let me check the matrices for P and Q. 

The matrix for P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables are Hermitian, so their matrices should be Hermitian. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2), so that's consistent. Similarly, (3,2) is 1/sqrt(2), and (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2). The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So yes, P is Hermitian. That makes sense.

The matrix for Q is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

Oh, that's a diagonal matrix, so it's definitely Hermitian. The eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q, in that order. So first, we measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I mixed up the order. The question says if someone measures Q just after measuring P. So the measurements are first P,
