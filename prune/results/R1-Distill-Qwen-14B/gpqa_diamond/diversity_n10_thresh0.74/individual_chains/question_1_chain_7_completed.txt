Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two energy levels would overlap in their uncertainty ranges.

So, the idea is that ΔE (the difference between E2 and E1) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Because if ΔE is larger than each individual uncertainty, then each energy's uncertainty range doesn't overlap with the other, so you can distinguish them.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. Each state has an uncertainty in energy, and for the two states to be resolved, the difference in energy between them must be at least the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of the uncertainties, then the two energy bands could overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So, I need to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state, sum them, and then the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than that sum.

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime of that state. So for state 1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and for state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. 

So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * τ1) = (1.05e-34 Js)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = approximately 5.25e-26 J. But wait, the options are in eV, so I need to convert this to electron volts.

Wait, but hold on. Let me compute each step carefully.

First, calculate each uncertainty.

Compute ΔE1: ħ/(2 τ1) where τ1 is 1e-9 s.

So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 s,

ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = approx 5.272859e-27 J.

Now, the sum of the two uncertainties is ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (5.272859e-26) + (5.272859e-27) = 5.272859e-26 + 0.5272859e-26 = 5.8e-26 J.

But wait, wait a second. Are we summing the two uncertainties, or is there another approach? Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty, but perhaps the combined uncertainty when measuring both together would be different. Hmm, not sure, but I think the standard approach is to sum the uncertainties if they're independent. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty for each state. Because if the energy difference is larger than each individual uncertainty, then the two energy levels are definitely separated. Because each level's uncertainty is a range around its energy, so if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, their ranges won't overlap.

Wait, but that would mean the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me think. Suppose ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). Then, since ΔE is larger than both, the two ranges [E1 - ΔE1/2, E1 + ΔE1/2] and [E2 - ΔE2/2, E2 + ΔE2/2] would not overlap as long as E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Wait, no, that would be the case if the difference is larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the correct condition for two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] to not overlap is that the distance between them is greater than the sum of their half-widths. So, if E2 > E1, then E2 - E1 > (ΔE1/2 + ΔE2/2) → which simplifies to E2 - E1 > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

But perhaps in practice, when people talk about resolving two energy levels, they require the energy difference to be at least equal to the sum of the uncertainties. So, ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but if the two uncertainties are ΔE1 and ΔE2, and the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1, then for them to be resolvable, ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2? Or perhaps greater than the maximum of the two?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference. Wait, because what's the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in each state's energy, so that their energy ranges don't overlap.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the minimum detectable energy difference based on the time resolution. Since the states have different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties are different.

Wait, but the problem is that the lifetime of each state is given separately. So perhaps the energy difference between the two must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than either uncertainty, then each energy level's uncertainty range won't include the other's energy.

Wait, let's think about it. Let's imagine two states: E1 and E2. The first has an uncertainty of ΔE1, the second ΔE2. For E2 - E1 to be resolvable, the difference must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if it's less, then the uncertainties could overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say E1 has a range from E1 - ΔE1/2 to E1 + ΔE1/2. E2's range is E2 - ΔE2/2 to E2 + ΔE2/2. The two ranges will not overlap if E2 - E1 > ΔE1/2 + ΔE2/2. That is, ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

Alternatively, if the energy difference is larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2, then the two ranges don't overlap. So the required condition is ΔE ≥ (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

Wait, but I may be getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that for a state with lifetime τ, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ).

So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.25e-26 J.

For E2, ΔE2 = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ≈ 5.25e-27 J.

So the minimum energy difference to resolve E1 and E2 would be the sum of the two uncertainties: ΔE ≥ (ΔE1 + ΔE2) = 5.25e-26 + 5.25e-27 = 5.775e-26 J.

Wait, but that's a very small number. Now, we need to convert this into eV because the options are in eV.

I recall that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So, to convert from J to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So, 5.775e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (5.775 / 1.602) * 1e-7 eV ≈ approx 3.605e-7 eV, which is 3.6e-7 eV.

Wait, that's about 3.6e-7 eV. But looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1 n eV.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → 0.01 n eV.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 100 micro eV.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.01 n eV.

Wait, none of the options are near 3.6e-7 eV. The closest option would be higher than that. But none of the options are that high. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the uncertainty in each state and find the minimal ΔE required.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, because if the energy difference is larger than each individual uncertainty, then each state's energy range won't include the other's energy. So, the minimal ΔE is the maximum of the two uncertainties.

In this case, E1 has a lifetime of 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) ≈ 5.25e-26 J.

E2's ΔE2 is ħ/(2τ2) = 5.25e-27 J.

So the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is about 5.25e-26 J. So the energy difference must be larger than 5.25e-26 J.

But wait, I'm confused. Let me compute 5.25e-26 J in eV.

5.25e-26 J = 5.25e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.27e-7 eV. So about 3.27e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, none of the options are near that. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the uncertainty in the energy difference. Let me think: when you have two states, the uncertainty in their energy difference is related to the combined lifetimes or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the energy difference needing to be larger than the uncertainty of each state's energy. So, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each individual state.

But perhaps another approach is to use the energy-time uncertainty principle for each state and find the minimal energy difference.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the time resolution in experiments. The lifetime of the state determines how precisely you can measure its energy. The longer the lifetime, the more precise the energy measurement.

Wait, so for E1, which has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s), the uncertainty in energy is larger than for E2, which has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s), so smaller uncertainty in energy.

So, the uncertainty for E1 is larger. Therefore, the minimal energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the uncertainty of E1 because if the difference is less than that, the two energies could be within each other's uncertainty ranges.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the more uncertain state, which is E1.

So, ΔE ≥ ΔE1 = 5.25e-26 J ≈ 3.27e-7 eV.

But again, none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the lifetimes given are the mean lifetimes, and the uncertainty in time is taken as the mean lifetime. So, the uncertainty in time is τ for each state.

Wait, going back to the uncertainty principle:

ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.

For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime τ.

So, for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.25e-26 J.

Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = 5.25e-27 J.

Now, the energy difference must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if ΔE is larger than both, then the two energy levels are separated by more than the uncertainty of either, so they can be resolved.

In that case, the minimal ΔE is the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2, which is ΔE1 = 5.25e-26 J ≈ 3.27e-7 eV.

But the options don't have an option near that. The highest option is C) 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV compared to 3.27e-7 eV. So 1e-4 is much larger. So that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 5.25e-26 J to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx (5.25 / 1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.27 * 1e-7 eV = 3.27e-7 eV.

So 3.27e-7 eV is 0.327e-6 eV, which is 0.327 micro eV. The options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1 n eV.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.01 n eV.

C)1e-4 eV → 100 micro eV.

D)1e-8 eV → 0.01 micro eV.

So the minimal ΔE is about 0.327 micro eV. So any energy difference larger than this would work.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro eV, which is way larger than 0.327 micro eV. So option C would certainly be sufficient. But wait, are there any other options that are larger than 0.327 micro eV?

Looking:

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV.

Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV, which is 100 micro eV. So that's much larger than our threshold.

But wait, the problem says which option "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any option where the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties would work. But in our earlier calculation, the sum was about 5.8e-26 J (3.6e-7 eV). So any ΔE larger than that would allow resolution.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV (1e-4 eV is way bigger than 3.6e-7 eV), so it's possible. But wait, let me check if the other options are above or below this threshold.

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is 1e-9 eV, which is 0.001 micro eV. That's much smaller than 3.6e-7 eV (0.36 micro eV), so it's too small. So option A's ΔE is too small to resolve.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller, so no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV is way larger than the threshold, so it would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.01 micro eV, which is less than 0.36 micro eV, so also too small.

So the only option that's larger than the required threshold is option C. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait a second. Let me think again. Because when I calculate the sum of the uncertainties for each state, the minimal ΔE is about 3.6e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would be resolvable.

But option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV. The required threshold was 3.6e-7 eV, which is 0.00000036 eV. So yes, option C is way larger, so it would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula in terms of the energy difference and the lifetimes.

The energy difference ΔE should satisfy ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/(2π), but I'm a bit confused about the exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the time resolution needed to resolve the two states. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is determined by the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties.

So, ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Which, as calculated earlier, is about 5.8e-26 J, which is about 3.6e-7 eV.

So any ΔE larger than that would work. Among the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. So it's way larger than the required 3.6e-7 eV.

So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because when you have two states, their combined uncertainty would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. So the energy difference must be larger than that sum. So the minimal ΔE is the sum of the two uncertainties, which is 3.6e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than that is acceptable.

So, the options that are larger than 3.6e-7 eV would be acceptable.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 eV is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV → not acceptable.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller → no.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger → acceptable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 eV is 0.01 micro eV, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV → no.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For \( E_1 \) with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

For \( E_2 \) with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert uncertainties to electron volts (eV)
To convert joules to electron volts, use \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the minimum energy difference for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E \geq \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E \geq 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \, \text{n}\text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 100 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \, \mu\text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clearly distinguishing the two energy levels is **Option C**.
