Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me visualize that structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds? Wait, no, let me count. The formula has C=C in two places. So, probably a diene or something similar.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make isolated atoms. But I'm not sure how that factors in here. Maybe it's used for calculating bond energies of C-H and C-C bonds, but wait, those are given too.

Wait, the problem is about enthalpy of formation. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this compound, which is a hydrocarbon, the elements would be carbon ( graphite or diamond?) and hydrogen gas.

But wait, the given bond energies are for breaking bonds. So I think I need to use the bond energy approach to calculate the enthalpy of formation. The formula for this would be:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

Wait, no, that's the enthalpy change for a reaction. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formation of the molecule from its constituent atoms would involve breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products.

Wait, the standard approach is: Enthalpy of formation of the molecule is the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds.

Wait, no, I think it's the reverse. Let me think. When you form a molecule, you break bonds in the reactants and form bonds in the products. The enthalpy change is (sum of bonds broken) minus (sum of bonds formed). But for formation, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. So for carbon, it's likely graphite, and hydrogen is H2 gas.

So, for the formation reaction:

Elements (in standard states) --> Compound

The bonds broken are the bonds in the elements. For carbon, if it
