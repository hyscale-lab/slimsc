Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think all operators in the Standard Model are Lorentz invariant. Since SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM as a subset, I guess all its operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, they wouldn't make sense in a relativistic framework. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Wait, but effective theories like SMEFT are usually considered in a low-energy (effective) sense, but wait, do they necessarily respect Poincare? Or is it that the SM respects Poincare, and SMEFT extends it. SMEFT operators are added as corrections, perhaps. Wait, but the SM has Poincare symmetry, so I think SMEFT operators should also respect it. Because if they didn't, then the theory wouldn't be consistent. So Poincare symmetry (2) must also be respected.

Now, CP symmetry (3). I remember that the SM doesn't respect CP symmetry on its own because of the CKM mechanism and other sources, but some models do. But the question is about what all SMEFT operators must respect. Wait, no, SMEFT includes all possible operators that are consistent with the SM symmetries. The SM breaks CP, so some operators in SMEFT might break CP as well. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So does SMEFT enforce operators to be CP-symmetric? Or can they violate it?

Wait, SMEFT operators are organized by their Lorentz structure and quantum numbers. For example, the operators are classified by their transformation properties. But I think operators can have terms that violate CP, but that depends on the specific operator. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any operator can violate a symmetry, then that symmetry isn't a must. For example, the SM includes operators that violate CP, so SMEFT would include such terms. So
