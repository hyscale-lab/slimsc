Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and ending up with product 3 after several steps. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. Oh right, KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides react with strong bases, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows some specific peaks. Let me look at the 1H NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, the IR peak at around 1720 usually corresponds to a carbonyl group. But wait, if product 1 is made from a dehydrohalogenation, would that form a carbonyl? No, that's elimination to form an alkene. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a structure where two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework. Heating with KOH would likely cause the two bromides to eliminate, forming a double bond. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 isn't an alkene but something else. Hmm, perhaps it's a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Heating with KOH in a good solvent might lead to a substitution. But 1,3
