Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I think the masses might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances. So maybe I can set that aside for now.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, the brackets denote the logarithmic ratio of the element's abundance relative to another. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ).

So [Fe/H]_1 being 0 means that the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that log10( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) = 0, which means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H)_2 = 0 means (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

Wait, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given. For the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, let me figure that out. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Then log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, so in the Sun, the number density of Fe relative to H is 10^(-4.5), and Mg relative to H is 10^(-5). So n_Mg/n_Fe in the Sun would be (10^-5)/(10^-4.5) )= 10^(-0.5) = approx 0.316. So [Mg/Fe]_sun = log(0.316) â‰ˆ -0.5. Hmm, but maybe I don't need that now.

Back to Star_1. [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. Which means log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) = 0.3. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n
