Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so the ratio (number in level 1 divided by level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher. We're to find the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by ratio when spots (R2), so R1/R2.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the usual Boltzmann equation applies.

Hmm, the key here is probably the effect of temperature on the population of energy levels. The Boltzmann distribution tells us that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio decreasing when the star has spots. So when Teff is lower, the ratio is lower. That suggests that the ratio increases with temperature. So higher temperature leads to higher ratio, which makes sense because higher temperature would mean more excitation, so higher energy levels are more populated.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Let me think: from Boltzmann, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).
