Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important in quantum mechanics because they correspond to possible outcomes of measurements and the states the system can be in.

The operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the first thing I think is that the operator P is a spin operator because spin systems are often described by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin-½ systems. So, the given operator is the spin operator for a spin-½ particle like a muon.

The problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction is in the x-z plane, meaning that the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, and the direction would lie somewhere in that plane. But since the direction is arbitrary, the eigenvector should be expressed in terms of angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ should be zero or something else? Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero because φ is the angle around the z-axis. So, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but for x-z plane, φ=0, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hmm, but that's the direction of the vector n.

Wait, but the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n, so the operator itself would be the dot product of n with the Pauli vector. So, the operator P is given by (P·n) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, n = (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

But the eigenvector would be along the direction of the operator. Because for eigenstates of spin operators, the eigenvectors correspond to the spin being aligned along that direction. So, the eigenvector should be the spin-up state along n.

Wait, but the given options have some trigonometric functions, so maybe we're to express the eigenvector in terms of θ, the angle from the z-axis, since the direction is in the x-z plane. So, the direction is given by an angle θ (polar angle) from the z-axis, with φ =0.

In that case, the operator P would be proportional to (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z
