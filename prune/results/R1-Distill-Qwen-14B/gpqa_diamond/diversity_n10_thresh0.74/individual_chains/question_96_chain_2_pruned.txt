Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon or something like that. Let me think. Oh right! The formula for the entropy (S) of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Wait, right, A is the area. So I need to find the area of the event horizon first. The event horizon is a sphere, so its area is 4πr², where r is the radius of the event horizon. But wait, what's the radius of a black hole's event horizon? Oh yeah, for a Schwarzschild black hole, the radius R is 2GM/c². So the area would be 4π (2GM/c²)².

But wait, maybe I don't need to get that complicated. Let me see what's given in the problem. The angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. The distance is 1e10 parsecs. So I can find the radius using the small angle approximation, which says that θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius and d is the distance. Because θ is so small, the approximation should hold.

So first, I'll convert θ from degrees to radians. Oh right, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * π/180. Let me calculate that. 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, and dividing by 180 gives about 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ R/d, so R = θ * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec in meters? I think 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m. Let me compute that: 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ * d. θ is 1.745e-19 radians, d is 3.086e26 m. Multiplying them: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let me see: 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.37. And 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, that's the radius of the event horizon?

Wait a second, but the Schwarzschild radius R_s is
