Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. 

Wait, so the system has electric potential energy because of the charges. Since the charges are identical, they will either all be positive or all negative. But I think the energy calculation depends on whether they're attracting or repelling. Oh right, same charges repel, so the potential energy will be positive because bringing them together requires work.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, while the other 12 are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the potential energy would come from the interactions between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12, as well as the interactions between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait no, wait. The problem says it's an isolated system. So all the interactions matter. Because the system's potential energy includes all pairs.

So first, let me outline the components:

1. The potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges at 2m.

2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since each of the 12 is at a radius of 2m from P
