Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. So the question is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait, the initial data says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, so I need to figure out how to use that information.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on the time passed; it's memoryless. Oh right, that's the key. So whether the atom was just created or has been around for a while, the probability of it decaying in the next interval is the same. So if I have a certain half-life or decay constant, I can calculate probabilities over any time period.

Wait, but in the question, the given is a 32% chance of decay within 100 minutes. So I think I can model this using the exponential decay formula. The decay probability, P, is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as P = e^(-λt) for the probability of not decaying.

Wait, actually, the equation for the survival probability (not decaying) after time t is P_survive = e^(-λ t). So the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λ t).

So the given data is that in 10
