Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions. The calcium-EDTA complex is one such complex. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in that solution. Oh, right, because in solution, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA.

So the reaction is probably something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, and the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the K given is K_Ca-EDTA =5e10. So Kf is 5x10^10.

So if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, and assuming that the solution is in equilibrium, we can model this.

Let me define the initial concentrations. Let's say the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, we get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. The complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So when the complex dissociates, each mole releases one mole of each.

So, for the complex, the concentration at equilibrium is 0.02 - x. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero, because the solution is solely the complex. Oh, but wait, no. Wait, the complex is in solution, and it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So let me think in terms of the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant Kf is 5e10, which is given by:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2−]

In this case, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, let's say at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both x. Because each mole of complex that dissociates gives one mole of each ion.

But wait, no. Because in solution, the EDTA is present as HnY (where n is the number of protons), but I think in this problem, since pH is ideal, we can assume that EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y^4−. So, the assumption is that EDTA is in the Y^4− form, so the concentration of EDTA^4− is equal to the amount dissociated.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, that would mean that the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2− is 0.02 M. Initially, any free Ca²+ or EDTA would be negligible. But in solution, some of the complex will dissociate.

So, let me model this.

Let’s let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Since each dissociation gives one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x, but since K is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That could simplify the calculation.

So, plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = x² / 0.02

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02

0.02 is 2e-2, so 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5*2) * (1e10 * 1e-2) )= 10 * 1e8 = 1e9.

So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 0.02 M is the initial concentration of the complex, and x would be the concentration of Ca²+ in solution, which can't be higher than 0.02 M, because the complex is the only source.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo that.

Wait, 5e10 = x² / 0.02

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02

0.02 is 2e-2.

So, 5e1
