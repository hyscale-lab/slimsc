Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, the pion is at rest. So I remember that in particle physics, when a particle is at rest and decays, the energy and momentum conservation laws apply. 

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, the pion is the parent particle, and it's stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta because the total momentum should remain zero. So the muon and neutrino will have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

I think I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are really light, almost massless. So for the neutrino, its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum times c, but since c is in the units, I can ignore it here. So the neutrino's energy is just |p| * c^2, but since we're using MeV and natural units where c=1, perhaps E = |p|.

Wait, let me get the setup right. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. The decay products are the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

So the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is all kinetic since its rest mass is zero.

Let me denote:
E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, actually, energy E is in MeV, and mass is in MeV/c². So when c is set to 1 (natural units), E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ), and similarly for the neutrino, E_nu = p.

Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

The total energy must equal the pion's rest energy. So:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² → sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Wait, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So plugging in the numbers:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that looks like an equation to solve for p. Let me let x = p, then:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6

I'll subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + 11175.49) = 139.6 - x

Then square both sides:

x² + 11175.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x²

Simplify: The x² terms cancel, so:

11175.49 = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 x

Compute (139.6)^2. Let me calculate that. 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, cross terms 2*139*0.6=166.8. So 139.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16 MeV².

So:

11175.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Rearranging: 279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11175.49

Calculate 19488.16 - 11175.49 → 8312.67.

So x = 8312.67 / 279.2 → Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 is about 8376, which is a bit higher than 8312.67. So let's see: 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376 → subtract 279.2 * 0.2 → 55.84 → 8376 -55.84= 8320.16. Wait, that's a bit more than 8312.67. Hmm, maybe 29.78?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8312.67 / 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 * 29.8 → 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 * 0.2=55.84 → 8376 -55.84=8320.16. Hmm, which is 8320.16. But the numerator is 8312.67, so the difference is 8320.16-8312.67=7.49. So that suggests x is about 29.8 minus (7.49 / 279.2) → 7.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.0268 → so x ≈29.7732.

Wait, but perhaps I should just compute 8312.67 / 279.2.

Divide 8312.67 by 279.2:

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's 29 → 8096.8.

But I have 8312.67, which is higher than 8096.8. So 8312.67-8096.8=215.87.

279.2 * 0.77 ≈ 214.7 (since 0.7*279.2=195.44, 0.07*279.2≈19.544 → total ≈214.984). So 215.87 is close to 0.77 of 279.2.

So total x ≈29.77 → p ≈29.77 MeV/c? Or in units where c=1, just MeV. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to just compute it accurately.

8312.67 / 279.2 → Let's compute:

279.2 × 29.8 = 279.2 × (30 - 0.2) → 279.2×30=8376, 279.2×0.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16.

But 8320.16 is more than 8312.67. So 29.8 is a bit too high. Let's see how much less: 8320.16 -8312.67 =7.49.

So each 0.1 in x reduces the product by 27.92 (since 279.2 ×0.1=27.92). So 7.49 is about 7.49/27.92 ≈0.268 of 0.1. So x is 29.8 -0.0268=29.7732.

So p≈29.773 MeV/c.

Wait, but that would make the neutrino's energy E_nu= p ≈29.773 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt((29.773)^2 + (105.7)^2).

Let me compute (29.773)^2: approx 29.773 *29.7
