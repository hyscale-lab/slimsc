Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this. I remember from my classes that when dealing with light and moving media, it's all about how different frames of reference affect the speed of light. Wait, but wait—Einstein's theory says the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, right? So that's a key point here.

The question says the glass has an index of refraction n. Index of refraction, yeah, that's how much the light slows down when entering the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the medium is c/n, since c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, this glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Hmm, so from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving towards us as well.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab. So how does the glass's motion affect the light's speed in the lab frame?

I think this has to do with the addition of velocities in relativity, but wait—that's for objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Here, the glass is moving at velocity v, which I guess is much less than c. So maybe we can use the classical velocity addition formula, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, the scenario is about light propagating through a moving medium. I remember something about the motion of the medium affecting the observed speed of light. Oh right, in classical physics, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but if the medium itself is moving, does the observed speed change? Or is it still c/n? Or perhaps it's adjusted based on the medium's velocity?

Wait a second, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, how does that affect the light's speed in the lab frame? Does the lab frame observer just add the velocities?

Wait, no, because addition of velocities isn't simply vector addition in relativity. Oh wait, but if v is much smaller than c, maybe non-relativistic approximations can be used.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame is still c, because the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. But wait, the question is about the speed in the glass relative to the observer. Hmm, no, the observer is in the lab, and the glass
