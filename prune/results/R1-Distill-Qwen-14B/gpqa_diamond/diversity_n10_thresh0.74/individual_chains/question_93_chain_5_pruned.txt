Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and a calibration curve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the scenario is that a scientist is running quantitative PCR. He made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran three technical replicates for each. The efficiency is 100%, and the R² is 1. That sounds perfect because a high R² (like 1) and 100% efficiency mean the PCR is working perfectly. The slope was -3.3. Wait, I remember that in qPCR, the slope of the calibration curve is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is -3.32 divided by the efficiency (if I'm not mistaken). But since efficiency here is 100%, which is 1 in decimal terms, so the slope should be around -3.32. Oh wait, the slope here is -3.3, which is close enough, probably due to rounding. So that's fine.

Looking at the results, he has different concentrations and their corresponding CT values. Let me jot down the data to visualize it better:

100000 copies/µl: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2
10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average ~30.9
1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → average ~27.6
100: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → average 24.3
10: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → average ~21.0

Wait, so each tenfold dilution is leading to an increase in CT by about 3.3 cycles each time. Let me see: from 100000 to 10000 (10x less), the CT goes up by about 3.3 (34.2 to 30.9 is 3.3). Then from 10000 to 1000, 30.9 to 27.6 is about 3.3. Similarly, 1000 to 100 is 3.3 (27.6 to 24.3), and 100 to 10 is 3.3 (24.3 to 21.0). So each tenfold decrease in concentration leads to an increase in CT of about 3.3. That makes sense because with each cycle, the amount doubles. So if you have 10 times less, you need about 3.3 cycles more to reach the same threshold (since 2^3.3 ≈ 10).

So the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Wait, the question states that the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so the data should fit perfectly. But looking at the CT values
