Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, let's see... The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability given in the options.

Wait, I remember that in hydrogen, when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs photons, and the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions... I think for the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Right, so the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one step up or down, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. We need to go down to |1,0,0>. Since the energy levels are quantized, the electron can't drop directly from n=3 to n=1 in one step because that would involve a change in l of -2, which isn't allowed by the selection rules. Oh wait, wait! So the electron must make the transition in two steps, each time changing l by ±1.

So the first step from n=3, l=0 to... Hmm, l can only go to 1 because 0 +1=1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. The possible m values for the first transition would be from m=0 to m=0, ±1. So possible transitions are |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>. Because n decreases by 1 each time, right? Because to go from n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1.

Wait, but wait, can n change by more than one? No, each dipole transition must change n by exactly ±1. So from n=3, you can go to n=2, then from n=2 to n=1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0> to a |2,1, m> state. Then the second transition goes from |2,1, m> to |1,0,0>.

Wait, but the second transition needs to go from l=1 to
