Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable using it with a VLT telescope. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But wait, the question is about whether a star can be detected with a certain signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure.

I think the S/N depends on several factors: the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the instrument's efficiency. Oh right, the formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time * telescope area)) / noise, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

I remember that the flux from a star is related to its apparent magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So more flux means higher S/N. The absolute magnitude is given for each option, but wait, absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star at their respective distances to find out how bright they are as seen from Earth.

The formula to calculate apparent magnitude (m) from absolute magnitude (M) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, the formula is actually m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5(log10(d) - 1). Or m = M +5*(log10(d) ) -5. Alternatively, m = M + 5*(log10 d -1). Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as m = M +5 +5 log10(d/10) → m = M +5 log10(d/10) +5.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). Because d is in parsecs, and 10 pc is the base. So when d=10, log10(10)=1, so it's m=M +5*(1-1)=M. That makes sense for d=10.

So for each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a bright star. Wait, what's its apparent magnitude? I think it's around -0.7, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find its absolute magnitude. Canopus is a supergiant, I think. Its absolute magnitude is about -5.7, but I might be mixing it up with another star. Alternatively, I can look it up in my memory that Canopus is one of the brightest stars, so its apparent magnitude is very low (bright).

Wait, but the question gives options a) to f). Let me see the options again.

Option a) is Canopus. Option b) is Polaris. I remember Polaris is a moderately bright star, but not as bright as Canopus. But I'm not exactly sure about their magnitudes. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on options c) to f) because they have given absolute magnitudes and distances, making it easier to calculate their apparent magnitudes.

So for options c to f:

c) Absolute V=15, distance=10 pc. Since M=15, d=10, so m=15 +5*(log10(10) -1) → log10(10)=1, so 1-1=0. So m=15. That's a very dim star.

d) same M=15, d=200 pc. So m =15 +5*(log10(200) -1). Log10(200) is about 2.3010. So 2.3010 -1 =1.3010. 5 *1.3010=6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505. Even dimmer.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. So m=15 +5*(log10(5) -1). Log10(5)=0.69897. So 0.69897 -1= -0.30103. 5 * (-0.30103)= -1.50515. So m=15 -1.50515≈13.495. So m≈13.5. Brighter than c but still dim.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. m=15 +5*(log10(50)-1). Log10(50)=1.69897. 1.69897-1=0.69897. 5 *0.69897≈3.4949. So m=15+3.4949≈18.495. So m≈18.5. So order of brightness from brightest to dimmest among c-f: e (m≈13.5), c (15), f (18.5), d (21.5).

But what about the other options, a and b?

a) Canopus: It's a very bright star. I think its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I can find its absolute magnitude. I think Canopus has an absolute magnitude of about -5.7, making it very bright. Wait, let me think. If Canopus is at a distance of, say, 300 pc, its apparent magnitude would be M +5 log10(300/10)= M +5*(log10(30)+something). Wait, but if it's a very bright star, then its apparent magnitude is low (negative or very small positive). So Canopus is definitely bright, so m is low.

b) Polaris: I'm pretty sure it's a relatively bright star, perhaps around magnitude 2 or so. Alternatively, I think Polaris is about magnitude 2.0. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's about 1.8 or so.

Wait, another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity. I remember that ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N ratios for a wide range of stars. The VLT is an 8m telescope, so it has a large collecting area. But for very faint stars, even with a large telescope, the S/N might not reach 10 in an hour.

The question is about whether a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel. So I need to figure out for each star whether the S/N after 1 hour is >=10.

I think S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, the square root of the telescope area, and the flux from the star. The flux from the star is determined by its apparent magnitude.

So the formula for S/N is something like:

S/N = (F * sqrt(t) * sqrt(A)) / R,

where F is the flux, t is exposure time, A is telescope area, and R is the noise, which depends on the instrument and background. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as S/N ∝ F * sqrt(t) * sqrt(A) / (readout noise + background noise), but maybe for this problem, it's simplified.

Alternatively, the formula is S/N = (Q * t) / sqrt(N), where Q is the quality factor, but perhaps the key is to know that S/N is proportional to the star's brightness (flux) and sqrt(t * A).

But perhaps a better approach is to recall that for a given instrument, the S/N depends on the star's magnitude. So each star's apparent magnitude will determine whether the S/N is sufficient.

I think that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10 for stars down to a certain magnitude. But I don't remember the exact limit.

Wait, from what I remember, ESPRESSO is capable of achieving S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for bright stars, but for very faint stars, it's lower. The question specifies a minimum of 10 per binned pixel.

So, each star's apparent magnitude will determine their flux, which in turn determines S/N.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is that S/N scales with 10^(-0.4*m) multiplied by sqrt(t), since flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m). Wait, let's see: the flux from a star is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F_0 is the flux from a star with m=0.

And the S/N is proportional to F * sqrt(t) * sqrt(A) / noise.

Wait, but without knowing the exact noise, perhaps the problem expects us to know which stars are bright enough for ESPRESSO to reach S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximate judgment based on the apparent magnitudes.

But how?

I think the VLT (8m) has a collecting area of about 64 m² (since the diameter is 8m, area is π*(8/2)^2 = π*16 ≈50.27 m². Wait, maybe I should double-check. The VLT Unit Telescopes have a diameter of 8.2m, so the area is π*(8.2/2)^2 = π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m². So A≈52.8 m².

But I'm not sure. Anyway, perhaps the exact area isn't needed as the question might be more about knowing the brightness of the stars.

Wait,ESPRESSO is a spectrograph, so perhaps its sensitivity is such that it can achieve S/N of 10 for stars brighter than a certain V magnitude. Let's assume that the limit is around V=10 or so.

Wait, I think that for ground-based telescopes, the limiting magnitude for spectroscopy varies, but maybe for ESPRESSO, which is a high-resolution spectrograph, it's more sensitive.

Alternatively, perhaps the V magnitude threshold is about 15, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the stars in options c, d, e, f all have the same absolute magnitude (M=15) but different distances, so their apparent magnitudes vary.

So for option e, which is at 5 pc: m = M +5 log10(5/10) → M=15, d=5 pc.

Wait, no, wait the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Because m = M +5 log10(d/10) → 5(log10(d) -1).

So for e, d=5: m=15 +5*(log10(5) ) -5*1 → 15 +5*(0.69897) -5 → 15 +3.4949 -5= 13.4949 ≈13.5.

So apparent magnitude of ~13.5.

For option c: d=10 → m=15 +5*(1) -5 →15 +5-5=15. So m=15.

Option f: d=50 → m=15 +5*(log10(50)) -5 → log10(50)=1.69897 → 5*1.69897=8.4949 → 15 +8.4949 -5= 18.4949≈18.5.

Option d: d=200 →m=15 +5*(log10(200)) -5 → log10(200)=2.3010 → 5*2.3010=11.505 →15+11.505-5=21.505≈21.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: very bright, m≈-0.7.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0.

c) m=15.

d) m=21.5.

e) m=13.5.

f) m=18.5.

Now, the question is which of these have S/N ≥10 in 1 hour.

Assuming that ESPRESSO can reach a certain S/N per magnitude. Let's think about the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N.

I think that for each 5 magnitudes, the S/N halves, because a difference of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in flux. Since S/N ∝ sqrt(flux), so a factor of 100 in flux would lead to a factor of 10 in S/N. Wait, no:

Wait, if flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*m), then for a difference of 5 magnitudes, F goes down by a factor of 100 (since 10^(-0.4*(m+5)) = 10^(-0.4 m -2) = F_initial * 10^-2 → F drops by 100). S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t), so if F drops by 100, S/N drops by 10 (since sqrt(100) is 10).

So for each 5 magnitudes, S/N is a factor of 10 lower.

Assuming that for a star with m=0, the S/N would be S_0. Then for m=5, the S/N is S_0 /10. For m=10, S_0 /100, etc.

But I don't know S_0. Alternatively, maybe I can find the approximate magnitude where S/N=10.

Wait, the ESPRESSO spectrograph is designed for high-resolution spectroscopy, so it's more sensitive to brighter stars. Let's think about the V magnitude.

But perhaps it's more practical to consider that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 10 for stars with apparent magnitude m around 20 or lower. Or perhaps lower. Let me think.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I can consider the V band's photon flux. The formula for the number of photons received from a star is N_ph = N_0 * 10^(-0.4*m) * t * A / wavelength^2, but this might be getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 for a star with V magnitude around 15 in an hour with the VLT. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the question again. I have to count how many of the six options (a-f) have S/N >=10.

So for each star:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.7. Bright, so S/N would be much higher than 10. So it's detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0. Also bright, so S/N would definitely be above 10. So detectable.

c) m=15. Let's say ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for m=15? I'm not sure. Maybe it's too dim.

d) m=21.5. Probably too dim.

e) m=13.5. Maybe detectable.

f) m=18.5. Maybe not.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the m limit. Let me think about how the S/N scales with magnitude.

Assume that a star of magnitude m=0 gives S/N= S_0. Then for m=5, S/N=S_0/10. For m=10, S_0/100. Wait, but this is a simplistic approach; in reality, the S/N also depends on the exposure time and the telescope size.

But the problem states that the exposure time is 1 hour, and the telescope is the 8m VLT.

If I can find a reference that gives the S/N for ESPRESSO as a function of magnitude, I could use that. But since I don't have the exact data, I'll have to make an educated guess.

ESPRESSO's design specifications mention that it can achieve a S/N ratio of 20 per pixel for a V=10 star in 1 hour with the UT (8m) telescope. Wait, that might be from memory.

If that's the case, then for a star of m=10, S/N=20. So for m=5, S/N=20 * sqrt(100) = 200, because each 5 magnitudes is a factor of 10 in flux, so sqrt(100)=10 in S/N.

Wait, no. Wait, if m increases by 5, S/N decreases by 10. So for m=10, S/N=20. Then, for m=15, S/N=20 /10=2. So that's below 10. For m=5, S/N=20 *10=200.

So in that case, the S/N would be:

a) m=-0.7 → way brighter than m=0, so S/N would be much higher than 20. So S/N>10.

b) m=2 → brighter than m=5, so S/N=200 * (10^(-0.4*(2-5))) → wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the 5-mag steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the S/N for each star's apparent magnitude.

Assuming that for m=10, S/N=20. So for each 5 mag steps:

m=5 → S/N=20 * sqrt(10^2) = 20 *10=200.

m=10 →20.

m=15 →2.

m=20 →0.2.

Wait, so for m=15, S/N=2, which is below 10. So stars with m <10 would have S/N >=20, which is above 10. So let's compute each star:

a) Canopus: m=-0.7 → way below m=5. So S/N=200 * 10^(-0.4*(-0.7 -5)) → wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula.

Alternatively, since m=10 gives S/N=20, then each 5-mag step down (brighter) increases S/N by a factor of 10.

Canopus is m=-0.7. So from m=10 to m=-0.7 is 10.7 magnitudes brighter. That's 10.7 /5=2.14 steps. Each step increases S/N by factor 10, so 10^2.14 ≈ 138 times. So S/N=20 *138≈2760. So way above 10.

b) Polaris: m=2. So from m=10, it's 8 magnitudes brighter. 8/5=1.6 steps. 10^1.6≈39.8. S/N=20 *39.8≈796. So S/N=796>10.

c) m=15: from m=10, it's 5 mags fainter. So S/N=20/10=2 <10. So not detectable.

d) m=21.5: 11.5 mags fainter than m=10. 11.5/5=2.3 steps. 10^2.3≈199.5. So S/N=20/199.5≈0.1, which is way below 10.

e) m=13.5: 3.5 mags fainter than m=10. So 3.5/5=0.7 steps. 10^0.7≈5. So S/N=20/5=4. So 4<10. Not detectable.

f) m=18.5: 8.5 mags fainter than m=10. 8.5/5=1.7 steps. 10^1.7≈50.1. So S/N=20/50.1≈0.4 <10. Not detectable.

Wait, but according to this, only a and b would have S/N >=10, because a and b have m lower than 10, so their S/N would be higher than 20. 

Wait, wait a moment. Let me re-express this. If m=10 gives S/N=20, then any star with m <10 would have S/N higher than 20. So for m=-0.7 and m=2, both are brighter than m=10, so their S/N will be significantly higher than 20, definitely above 10.

So for a and b, S/N is well above 10. So they are detectable.

Options c, d, e, f: 

c) m=15 → S/N=2 <10 → not detectable.

d) m=21.5 → S/N=0.1 → not detectable.

e) m=13.5 → S/N=4 <10 → not detectable.

f) m=18.5 → S/N=0.4 → not detectable.

Wait, but according to this analysis, only a and b are detectable. So that's 2 stars.

But wait, what about the star in option e, which is at 5 pc and m=13.5. According to the calculation, S/N is 4, which is below 10. So not detectable.

What about the star in option e, m=13.5. Another approach: Let's say the S/N scales as 10^(-0.4*(m - m_ref)), where m_ref is the reference magnitude (say, m=10 for S/N=20).

So for m=13.5:

S/N = 20 * 10^(-0.4*(13.5 -10)) → 20 * 10^(-0.4*3.5) → 20 * 10^(-1.4) → 10^(-1.4)= approx 0.0398. So 20 *0.0398≈0.796, which is way below 10. So S/N=0.796. So not detectable.

So according to this, only a and b are detectable, which gives a count of 2 stars. Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the answer would be A) 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe I was wrong about the m=10 S/N=20. Maybe the actual limit is lower. Because if the S/N is 20 at m=10, then for m=15, it's 2, which is below 10. So only stars brighter than m=10 would have S/N >=20. So only a and b are detectable.

But another thought: maybe the calculation is based on the fact that the star's flux is sufficient to achieve S/N=10. Suppose that for a star with m=15, the S/N is 2, which is below 10. So it's not detectable.

So the conclusion is that only a and b meet the condition, so 2 stars. So the answer is option A.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N is proportional to the flux of the star, which decreases with increasing apparent magnitude. For ESPRESSO, it is assumed that a star with an apparent magnitude of \( m = 10 \) achieves an S/N of 20 in 1 hour. For every 5-magnitude increase, the S/N decreases by a factor of 10 due to the inverse square root relationship between flux and S/N.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option a) Canopus**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This is much brighter than \( m = 10 \), so the S/N will be significantly higher than 10. **Detectable.**

2. **Option b) Polaris**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is brighter than \( m = 10 \). The S/N will also be much higher than 10. **Detectable.**

3. **Option c)**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15
   \]  
   A star with \( m = 15 \) is much fainter than \( m = 10 \). The S/N will be \( 20 / 10^{(15-10)/5} = 20 / 10 = 2 \), which is below 10. **Not detectable.**

4. **Option d)**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 21.5
   \]  
   A star with \( m = 21.5 \) is even fainter than \( m = 15 \). The S/N will be \( 20 / 10^{(21.5-10)/5} = 20 / 10^{2.3} \approx 20 / 199.5 \approx 0.1 \), which is far below 10. **Not detectable.**

5. **Option e)**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 13.5
   \]  
   A star with \( m = 13.5 \) is fainter than \( m = 10 \). The S/N will be \( 20 / 10^{(13.5-10)/5} = 20 / 10^{0.7} \approx 20 / 5 = 4 \), which is below 10. **Not detectable.**

6. **Option f)**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 \approx 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 18.5
   \]  
   A star with \( m = 18.5 \) is fainter than \( m = 15 \). The S/N will be \( 20 / 10^{(18.5-10)/5} = 20 / 10^{1.7} \approx 20 / 50.1 \approx 0.4 \), which is far below 10. **Not detectable.**

### Conclusion:
Only stars **a (Canopus)** and **b (Polaris)** have apparent magnitudes bright enough to achieve an S/N of at least 10 in 1 hour. Therefore, **2 stars** are detectable.

**Answer: A**
