Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, the RV method gives us mass estimates, but not the exact mass because it depends on the inclination. But for transit probabilities, I think the inclination is a big factor because the planet has to pass in front of the star as seen from Earth. So, the probability is higher if the orbital plane is edge-on.

But how do I calculate the transit probability? I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Oh right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_p / a) * (1/e), where e is the orbital eccentricity. But wait, in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so e is zero. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for the transit probability for a circular orbit is (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²)^0.5), but since e is zero, it's just R_p/a. Hmm, but wait, R_p is the planet's radius, but wait, for Earth-like planets, I suppose R_p is similar. Oh but I think I'm mixing things up. Wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + something) divided by (a * something else), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, another approach. The transit probability P is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but because e is zero, it's (R_star + R_planet) / a. But for Earth-sized planets, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's approximated as R_star / a.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size, right? More precisely, it's (R_p + R_*) / a, but when R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's roughly R_* / a, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, I think the actual probability is (R
