Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it produces. Hmm, I think it's related to antenna radiation or something like that. Let me try to break this down.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So, I'm picturing a sort of oval shape, maybe like a prolate spheroid. Since it's oscillating, it should emit electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength is lambda, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A, and they're asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power pattern depends on the angle theta. The radiated power in the far field (radiation zone) for a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2 divided by r squared, but wait, I'm trying to recall the exact dependence. Oh right! The power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is proportional to sinÂ²(theta). So the maximum intensity is when sin(theta) is 1, which is theta=90 degrees. At theta=0 or 180, the intensity is zero.

Wait, but this is about the fraction of the maximum power. The maximum power is when the intensity is highest, which is at theta=90 degrees. So the fraction at a different theta would be (sin(theta)^2) / (sin(90)^2), right? Because maximum is sin(90)=1, so the fraction is just sin(theta)^2.

So for theta=30 degrees, sin(30) is 0.5. Squared is 0.25. So 0.25 times the maximum A. So the fraction would be 1/4. That's looking at the options, maybe option B or C.

Now, the second part of the question is about the form of f, which is the function of lambda and theta. So, the power per unit solid angle, f, should have certain dependencies.

From what I remember, the radiation from an oscillating dipole has a power proportional to (1/lambda^4) times sin^2(theta). Because the power is proportional to the square of the acceleration (from the Larmor formula), and since the frequency is 1/lambda, the (1/lambda^4) dependence comes from the frequency squared terms. Also, the radiation resistance and other terms involve lambda squared, so when squared, that's lambda^4.

So f would be proportional to (sin(theta))^2 / lambda^4. So the function f would be something like f(theta, lambda) = k * sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1/2, lambda^-4. So fraction is 1/2, which doesn't match our earlier calculation for 30 degrees. So A's fraction is 1/2, which is likely incorrect.

Option B: 1/4, lambda^-3. The fraction is 1/4, which matches our calculation. But the form is lambda^-3, which would be if the dependency was (1/lambda^3). But I thought it was (1/lambda^4). So option B might not be correct.

Option C: 1/4, lambda^-4. That matches both the fraction and the lambda dependence. So C could be the answer.

Option D: 3/4, lambda^-6. The fraction doesn't match, and the lambda exponent is even higher. I don't think that's right.

So putting it together, the fraction at theta=30 is 1/4, and the form is lambda to the -4. So the correct option should be C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f\).

For dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is therefore \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\), or \(1/4\).

The function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) depends on the radiation characteristics. For an oscillating dipole, the radiated power is proportional to \(1/\lambda^4\), as derived from the Larmor formula and the dependence on frequency. Thus, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(k \sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4\), where \(k\) is a proportionality constant.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: The fraction is \(1/2\), which is incorrect since the fraction at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\). The form \(1/\lambda^4\) is correct.
- **Option B**: The fraction \(1/4\) is correct, but the form \(1/\lambda^3\) is incorrect, as the dependence is \(1/\lambda^4\).
- **Option C**: The fraction \(1/4\) and the form \(1/\lambda^4\) are both correct.
- **Option D**: The fraction \(3/4\) is incorrect, and the form \(1/\lambda^6\) is also incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it matches both the fraction of the maximum power and the form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

Answer: C
