Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. So σ is antisymmetric, which makes sense because F is the field strength tensor which is also antisymmetric.

Wait, the gamma matrices are involved here. So this looks like a term involving the Dirac spinor ψ, which is a fermion. The F^{μν} is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, I think. So this interaction term is probably for a fermion interacting with a gauge field, like electromagnetism or maybe another gauge theory.

But the question is about the dimension of κ and renormalizability. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have couplings with positive mass dimension (since in 4 dimensions, dimensionless couplings would be marginal, but wait, actually, in 4D, renormalizable theories are those where the coupling has dimension ≤ 4 in mass units, or something like that. Wait, no, the correct way is to think about the term in the Lagrangian. Each term must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (since in natural units, the action is in units of ℏ, which is dimensionless in natural units). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over d^4x (dimension 4), the Lagrangian must be dimensionless in each term, so each term has dimension 4.

So the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Wait, let me break it down. The σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, so each γ has dimension 1/2 because in 4D, the gamma matrices are dimension 1/2 (since spinor fields have dimension 3/2, and each ψ is γ^{μ} ∂_μ acting on them, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of
