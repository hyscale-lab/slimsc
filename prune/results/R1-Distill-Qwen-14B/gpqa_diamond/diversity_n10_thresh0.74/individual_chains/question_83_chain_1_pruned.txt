Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so their reaction should form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

First, I need to understand the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, the question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So I'll have to calculate two pH values.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the initial solution after dilution. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. When you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. So initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be the same, 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence: moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Since the total initial solution is 40 cm³, the 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% titration refers to the fraction of the total acid that's been neutralized. Because, for each mole of NaOH added, it neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So at 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.

So, first, let's think about the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate and any
