Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe. Hmm, interesting. The question says that in this universe, a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, which is different from our real world where magnets always have both poles. So, Maxwell's equations would look different. The question is, which specific equations would change?

I remember Maxwell's equations in our universe are four in total. They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and how they're generated by charges and currents. Let me list them out:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of H equals the time derivative of D plus the current density.

Wait, right. So in our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because we don't have isolated magnetic monopoles; every magnet has both a north and south pole. So if in this other universe they do have isolated poles, that second equation must change. Because Gauss's Law for magnetism would no longer hold as it is.

But the question is about which of Maxwell's equations are different. So the second equation would probably be modified. But wait, the options mention more than one equation changing sometimes. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 2. So that's one equation that's different.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and divergence of B. So that would be equations 3 and 2. Because in our equations, equation 3 involves the curl of E. But I'm not sure why that would change. Wait, in our universe, equation 3 is Faraday's law, which relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Faraday's law?

Hmm. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations change in a specific way. I think that the divergence of B would not be zero anymore. So equation 2 changes. Also, Faraday's law would have an additional term. Let me think. Normally, Faraday's law is curl E = - dB/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, I think there's another term involving the magnetic current. Oh right, the modified Maxwell equations when magnetic monopoles exist are often referred to as the "symmetric" form.

Wait, what's the symmetric form? I think when magnetic charges are present, both the divergence of E and the divergence of B can be non-zero. Oh wait, no. Wait, in our universe, Gauss's law for E is divergence of E = rho_electric / eps0, and divergence of B is zero. With magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would be rho_magnetic over some constant, maybe mu0 or something. So equation 2 would change.

What about Faraday's law? In the presence of magnetic current, Faraday's law might have an extra term. Because normally, Faraday's law is curl E = - dB/dt. But if there's a magnetic current density J_m, then perhaps the equation becomes curl E = - dB/dt - J_m? Or something like that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. I remember that when magnetic charges and currents are introduced, two of Maxwell's equations change
