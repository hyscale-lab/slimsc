Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which I think usually indicates an O-H stretch, like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe from an conjugated system or maybe an aromatic ring with some substituents?

Looking at the NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group, maybe a double bond somewhere.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment, like from a butyl group or maybe a CH3CO+ ion. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight for C3H7 (since 3*12 +7=43? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. CH3CO is 43 (12*2+3*1 +16) = 43? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from a ketone or another structure. Oh wait, maybe it's from a (CH3)2CO (acetone) ion? No, acetone's molecular ion is 58. Hmm, another option: maybe it's a CH2=CHCO group breaking off. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CH2CO+ or something else. I might need to think more about this later.

Now, looking at the options, the formulas are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The degrees of unsaturation could help. Let me calculate that. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

Wait, wait. Wait, that's not exactly right. The correct formula is Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But since X and N are zero here, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2.

So let's compute each option:

Option A: C6H12O2
C=6, H=12, O=2.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (14 -14)/2=0. So zero? That can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, oxygen doesn't directly contribute to DoU in this formula. Wait, I think I might have confused O's role. Let me think again. The formula for DoU is (2C + 2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2. Wait, is that right? Because each O can account for a double bond or ring, similar to H. So I think the correct formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2.

Wait, no, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let's double-check. The standard formula is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/ 2.

But oxygen and halogens are treated differently. Each O doesn't count as a subtraction, but each X (like Cl) does. So for each O, it's subtracted as 2O. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up in my notes.

Ah, wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2.

So each O contributes as 2O subtracted. So for each molecule, DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N - 2O)/2.

So let's compute each option.

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0 -2*2)/2 = (12 +2 -12 -4)/2 = (14-12-4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Wait, that can't be right. Degrees of Unsaturation can't be negative. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N) /2.

But considering that each O molecule contributes as (O as 2O, but I'm not sure... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let me compute DoU for each formula:

Option A: C6H12O2.

The formula is C6H12O2. The molecular formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2O. But with O, it's a bit tricky. Wait, perhaps considering H only. Let's compute the DoU without O first.

Hydrogens in a fully saturated molecule (alkane) would be 2n +2, where n is the number of carbons. Here, n=6, so 2*6 +2=14. But the given H is 12, so it's 2 less. Each degree of unsaturation accounts for 2 H's (each ring or double bond). So the deficit is 2 H, which is 1 DoU. But then considering O, which can be from a carbonyl group. So if O is present as a carbonyl, that adds another DoU. So let's see: Suppose the structure has a carbonyl group (C=O), which is a DoU. So for O2, perhaps two carbonyl groups, each adding a DoU. So total DoU would be 1 (from H deficit) + 2 (from O) =3. So DoU is 3.

Wait, but let me compute it properly.

DoU formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N - 2O)/
