Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Alright, so the question is about calculating the electrostatic potential energy of this system. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, this is a Coulomb potential problem.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, which is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But since there are multiple charges, I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So, in this case, the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge at P.

Wait, but each of the 12 is also a charge, so each of them interacts with the fixed charge. Also, the 12 charges at 2m from P—do they interact with each other? Because each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances would depend on how they're arranged. But since the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their arrangement among themselves isn't specified. Hmm, but for the minimum energy, perhaps we can assume that the mutual distances between them are very large, so their mutual potential energy is negligible compared to their potential due to the fixed charge. Or maybe I should calculate both contributions.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the problem again. The setup is that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of those 12 is at a radius of 2m around P. So, their arrangement is, perhaps, on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. So each of the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances would vary depending on
