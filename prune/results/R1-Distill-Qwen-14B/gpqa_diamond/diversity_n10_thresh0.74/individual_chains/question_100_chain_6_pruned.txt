Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on organic chemistry, but let's take it step by step.

So, the starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane. But considering the reactions, maybe it's propene because cyclopropane tends to be more stable and maybe doesn't react the same way.

First reaction: A undergoes bromination in CCl4. Oh, right, that's an addition reaction. So if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3), bromination would add bromine across the double bond. So propene adding Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So B is a dibromide, and with KOH, it would lose HBr and form a double bond again. Wait, but which position? If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then eliminating would give either propene or maybe another alkene. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane losing two HBr molecules would form propene. So compound C is propene again? Or is there another possibility?

Wait, wait. Wait, dibromide can undergo elimination in two steps. Or maybe, when you have 1,2-dibromide, the KOH could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So for 1,2-dibrom
