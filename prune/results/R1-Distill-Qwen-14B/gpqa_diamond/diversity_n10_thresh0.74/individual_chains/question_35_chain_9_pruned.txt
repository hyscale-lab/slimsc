Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). I remember that matrices like this often relate to spin operators. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, it's probably spin-1/2, like for an electron or muon.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. And then choosing which statement is correct from the options given.

So, first, let's write down the matrix for Ay. The constant c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
               [ i    0 ]

Which is:

[ 0, -(h/(4π))i ] 
[ (h/(4π))i, 0 ]

Wait, because (h/(4π))*(-i) is -(h/(4π)i), and similarly for the other element.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

The matrix Ay - λI is:

[ -λ      -(h/(4π))i ]
[ (h/(4π))i   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (h/(4π)i) * (-(h/(4π))i) ].

Which is λ² - [ (h/(4π))² (i)(-i) ) ].

Wait, because (h/(4π)i) * ( - (h/(4π))i ) = -(h/(4π))^2 i^2.

But i^2 is -1, so this becomes -(h/(4π))^2 * (-1) = (h/(4π))^2.

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h/(4π))² = 0.

So λ² = (h/(4π))² ⇒ λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I think the eigenvalues for spin components are ± ħ/2. Because for spin 1/2, the eigenvalues of S_i are ± ħ/2. But wait, here Ay is c * S, and c is h/(4π). Let me check the relation between h and ħ.

Oh right! h = 2πħ, so ħ = h/(2π). So c = h/(4π) is equal to ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

So then, the eigenvalues are ± c * ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the eigenvalues of S are ± ħ/2. Because S is the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/
