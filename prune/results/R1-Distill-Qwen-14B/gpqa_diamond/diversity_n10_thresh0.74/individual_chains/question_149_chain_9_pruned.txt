Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude sample is mostly as expected, except there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. And importantly, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, so why would there be two peaks for the same proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis, it shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule. So, they're either the same compound or isomers or something else.

So, the options are A through D. Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If the compound is contaminated, then the NMR would show peaks from the impurity. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two peaks. If it's a precursor, the NMR would probably have different shifts for its protons. But the integrals add up to 1H, so maybe not a precursor, maybe a byproduct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would cause the NMR to show the same shifts because they are mirror images, right? But wait, no. Wait, in achiral environments, enantiomers have the same NMR shifts because they experience the same environment. But if the molecule has some sort of diastereotopic protons or if the alpha proton is in a chiral environment, maybe it splits. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because the environments are equivalent for each enantiomer, but wait, noâ€”if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would be in symmetric environments, so their NMR signals might not split. Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show splitting because the two enantiomers are identical in terms of their effect on NMR. So either way, same as the pure compound. Unless the alpha protons are in a diastereotopic position, but that might not fit. Hmm, but the question states that the coupling is ruled out, so maybe it's not coupling. So maybe enantiomers are not the issue.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Wait, what's 'double coupling'? I'm not entirely sure, but maybe during the formation of the amide bond, some sort of coupling happened which introduced another peak. But I'm not too familiar with that term. Alternatively, maybe it's about the splitting due to coupling with another proton, but the question says that the coupling pattern rules that out. So that probably isn't the case.

Option D: M
