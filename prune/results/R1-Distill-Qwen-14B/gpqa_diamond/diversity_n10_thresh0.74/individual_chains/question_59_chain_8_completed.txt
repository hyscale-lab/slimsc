Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I think that's what's happening here.

First, I'll write down the given data. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, I should probably convert all the volumes to liters because molarity is moles per liter. Let's see:

500 mL = 0.5 L
400 mL = 0.4 L
300 mL = 0.3 L

Now, I need to find out how many moles of each acid and base are present.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = moles / volume → moles = Molarity × volume
So, 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

For HCl:
0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl.

For Ba(OH)2: Hmm, right, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So, moles of OH^- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated into H+ and Cl^- ions. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+.

So, HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. So its contribution of H+ is negligible compared to strong acids, but maybe in this case, the other acids and the OH- will affect it more.

But wait, the key here is to find the net H+ or OH- after mixing all these solutions.

When you mix acids and bases, they react. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So, the total H+ before reaction is from HCl and any H+ from CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it's the main source of H+. Let's calculate the total H+.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, which will contribute some H+ but not as much. But since in the presence of a strong acid, maybe the contribution is minimal. Alternatively, since we have a strong base, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible in the presence of excess OH-.

But perhaps for this problem, we can consider the net reaction between H+ and OH-.

Wait, so the total moles of H+ from all sources (like HCl and CH3COOH) and the total moles of OH- from the base (Ba(OH)2).

Let me think:

Total H+ = moles from HCl + moles from CH3COOH (but CH3COOH's contribution is much less as it's weak, but not sure if it's negligible in this case).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the reaction between H+ and OH-.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the moles of H+ and OH- will determine whether there's excess acid or base.

So, let's calculate total H+ and total OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Well, it's a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. The initial concentration after mixing would matter. But this could complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to first find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but first, let's calculate the total volumes because when you mix the solutions, the volume changes.

Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL → 1.2 L.

So, when mixing, the concentrations are diluted.

But perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- first, then see the net.

Wait, let me proceed step by step.

Compute moles of H+:

HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH contributes some H+. Let's say for now, it's negligible compared to HCl. Because 0.08 is a larger amount than what CH3COOH would contribute. Wait, CH3COOH is 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, its H+ is less than 0.05.

Wait, but when you mix, the H+ from CH3COOH might react with OH- as well. So perhaps you can't ignore it.

Alternatively, perhaps we should compute the total moles.

Wait, let me think about this again.

Total H+:

From HCl: 0.08 moles.

From CH3COOH: Let's approximate it. Let me compute the H+ from CH3COOH as follows. The initial concentration after mixing will be diluted. Wait, but for the purpose of moles, perhaps it's better to consider the initial moles.

Wait, another approach: when all the solutions are mixed, the volumes add up.

So, the total volume is 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L.

So, the concentrations of each after mixing would be:

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

HCl: 0.08 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0667 M.

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.075 M.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, the OH^- concentration from Ba(OH)2 is (0.09 moles) * 2 / 1.2 L = 0.15 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the OH- from Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

So, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So, the OH- is about 0.18 moles in 1.2 L. So, 0.18 / 1.2 = 0.15 M.

And H+ sources are HCl (0.08 moles) and CH3COOH (0.05 moles, but only a portion dissociates).

Wait, but in the presence of a strong acid and strong base, the reaction will proceed, and the weak acid's H+ may not be as significant.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to calculate the total H+ and total OH- in the mixture, considering all sources.

Total H+:

From HCl: 0.08 moles.

From CH3COOH: Let's think of it as a weak acid. The dissociation is CH3COOH → H+ + CH3COO^-.

The initial concentration after mixing is 0.0417 M (0.05 mol /1.2 L).

The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. So, the dissociation is small.

So, [H+] from CH3COOH is sqrt( (Ka * C) ), where C is the concentration.

So, Ka = 1.8e-5, C = 0.0417 M.

Ka * C = (1.8e-5) * (0.0417) ≈ 7.506e-7.

So, sqrt(7.506e-7) ≈ 2.74e-4 M → which is 0.000274 moles in 1.2 L → but wait, no, wait, that's molarity. Wait, no, wait, that's concentration. So, the total H+ from CH3COOH would be 2.74e-4 M * 1.2 L = 0.0003288 moles.

That's about 0.00033 moles, which is much less than the 0.08 moles from HCl. So, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl.

So, total H+ is approximately 0.08 moles.

Total OH- is 0.18 moles (from Ba(OH)2).

So, total H+ from all sources (HCl and CH3COOH) is 0.08 + 0.00033 ≈ 0.08033 moles.

Now, OH- is 0.18 moles.

So, the OH- will react with the H+.

The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the OH- will neutralize the H+.

But the H+ is less than the OH-. So, the OH- will have some left over.

Let me compute which is in excess.

Total H+ available: ~0.08033 moles.

Total OH-: 0.18 moles.

So, H+ is consumed by OH-:

Moles of H+ after reaction = 0.08033 - 0.18 → negative, which doesn't make sense. Instead, the OH- will neutralize all H+, and the excess OH- will remain.

So, moles of OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08033 = 0.10 (approx) moles.

Wait, let me compute it exactly.

0.18 - 0.08033 = 0.09967 ≈ 0.10 moles of OH- excess.

So, the solution will be basic because OH- is in excess.

Now, the total volume is 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.09967 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.08306 M.

Then, pOH = -log[OH^-] = -log(0.08306).

Calculate that.

Log(0.08306) → since 10^-1 is 0.1, 0.08 is 10^-1.0969 (since log(0.08) ≈ -1.0969).

But let me compute it more accurately.

0.08306 is 8.306e-2.

Log(8.306e-2) = log(8.306) + log(1e-2).

Log(8.306) is about 0.919.

So, log(8.306e-2) ≈ 0.919 - 2 = -1.081.

So, pOH = - (-1.081) = 1.081.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.081 ≈ 12.919.

Wait, but wait, that's significantly different from the options given. The options are A) 12.62, B)1.38, C)8.92, D)8.68.

Hmm, 12.92 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the moles. Let me double-check.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles, correct.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05, correct.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09, which gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, when you mix all the solutions, are the moles additive?

Yes, because when you mix, the total moles of H+ and OH- come from all sources.

So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH contributes some H+ but it's a weak acid. But in our earlier calculation, the H+ from CH3COOH was negligible, so perhaps the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, the concentration is 0.10 / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0833 M.

But then pOH is about 1.08, so pH is 12.92. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are A)12.62, B)1.38, C)8.92, D)8.68.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: when mixing, the Ba(OH)2 might react with the acetic acid, a weak acid. So, perhaps the reaction isn't just between the strong acid and base but also between the weak acid and the strong base.

Wait, okay, let me think again. Maybe I should consider all the possible reactions.

First, the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will neutralize each other, producing water. Then, any remaining strong base will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).

Wait, let me break it down:

1. HCl (strong acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (strong base).

The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

They will neutralize each other as follows:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.08 moles of H+ will react with 0.08 moles of OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Then, these remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, which can donate H+. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of OH- after reacting with HCl: 0.10.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH. How much?

Each mole of CH3COOH can neutralize one mole of OH-.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, moles of OH- remaining after that: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So, now, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, but what about the CH3COOH after reaction? Some of it would have reacted, but perhaps the rest remains as a weak acid.

Wait, but after the OH- neutralizes some of the CH3COOH, the remaining CH3COOH and its conjugate base (CH3COO^-) will form a buffer solution.

So, the moles of CH3COOH left: 0.05 - 0.05 = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Because the OH- comes in and reacts with CH3COOH.

Each mole of OH- will react with a mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^- and water.

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.05.

Moles of OH- after HCl reaction: 0.10.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of CH3COOH consumed: min(0.05, 0.10). So, 0.05 moles.

Thus, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.05 - 0.05 = 0.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.05.

Moles of OH- remaining: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.

So, after all reactions, the solution has 0.05 moles of OH-, 0.05 moles of CH3COO^- and the rest of the ions.

Wait, but then the OH- is 0.05 moles. Let's calculate the concentration.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

Concentration of OH-: 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) → log(0.04167) is about -1.38, so pOH is 1.38, so pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Ah, that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62.

Wait, so this makes sense. So, the initial approach I took missed the reaction between the OH- and the CH3COOH. Because I thought the H+ from CH3COOH was negligible, but actually, the OH- reacts with the CH3COOH, reducing the amount of OH-.

So, the correct approach is:

1. H+ from HCl (0.08) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.18) → neutralizes 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.10 moles.

2. The remaining OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05), neutralizing all 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

3. The remaining OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L → [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Which is option A.

So, the correct answer is A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. The key steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each substance
- **CH₃COOH**:  
  \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so its contribution of \( \text{H}^+ \) is initially negligible compared to the strong acid (HCl).

- **HCl**:  
  \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
  HCl is a strong acid, fully dissociating into \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{Cl}^- \), contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}^+ \).

- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into \( \text{Ba}^{2+} \) and \( 2 \, \text{OH}^- \), contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 2: Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻
The \( \text{H}^+ \) from HCl and the \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂ react as follows:  
\[
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
- Total \( \text{H}^+ \): \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Total \( \text{OH}^- \): \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  

All \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{H}^+ \) are neutralized by \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 3: Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \) react with CH₃COOH:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
- Moles of CH₃COOH: \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
- Moles of OH⁻: \( 0.10 \, \text{moles} \).  

The \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) neutralizes \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of } \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 4: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option **A**.
