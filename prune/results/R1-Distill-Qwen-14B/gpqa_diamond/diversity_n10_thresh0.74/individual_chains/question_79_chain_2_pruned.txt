Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its NMR data after a reaction. The reaction conditions involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that this reagent is often used in the Birch reduction, but wait, Birch usually involves metals like sodium or potassium and an amine like this. Or wait, maybe it's used in epoxidation? No, Birch is for aromatic rings, like reducing them. But the product here might be an epoxide since the options have words like oxirane or epoxide.

Compound X is C11H12O. Let me think about the molecular formula. Breaking it down: 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, one oxygen. The options are various oxirane derivatives, so epoxides. The product after reaction is the epoxide, so maybe compound X was an alkene that got epoxidized.

Looking at the NMR data provided. The 1H NMR shows:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s). So two singlets each integrating to 3H. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Maybe they're attached to an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom. Wait, like a methyl group next to an oxygen? Or in a conjugated system.

Then 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). These are aromatic protons. Let's see, the splitting suggests some coupling. The doublets could be from para-substituted rings or ortho. Wait, the two doublets around 7.7 might be part of a para-substituted benzene. Let me think: a styryl group. Styryl is a vinylbenzene, so maybe that's part of the structure.

Looking at the 13C NMR: 21.3 and 28.4 are probably the two methyl groups. Then a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region, and one at 197.7 ppm. That's a carbonyl, but wait, in an epoxide, the carbons are adjacent to oxygen. Oh wait, in epoxides, the carbons are typically in the range of around 60-70 ppm, but wait, I might be mixing up. Alternatively, 197.7 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester carbonyl. Hmm, but the product is an epoxide, so maybe that's the oxygenated carbons. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl from another group. Wait, but the product is an epoxide, so maybe that's the original carbonyl that was epoxidized. Maybe the starting material was a ketone that became an epoxide? Or perhaps the epoxide has carbons that are deshielded, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the product. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo
