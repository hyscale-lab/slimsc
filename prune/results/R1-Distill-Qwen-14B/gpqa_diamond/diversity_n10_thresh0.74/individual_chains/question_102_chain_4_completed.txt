Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they looked under the confocal microscope. Let's see what the question says.

First, the setup: they have a ligand-receptor pair. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and some beta sheets for the binding site. 

They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two ORFs in one vector, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh, right, IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated as a separate ORF after the ligand.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette. But wait, lox2272 is a variant that can only be cut by Cre if another lox site is nearby. Oh, right, lox2272 and loxP are different. Cre can only cut lox2272 if there's a compatible site, like another lox2272 or a loxP. Wait, no, actually, lox2272 is a mutated version that is not cut by wild-type Cre. Oh wait, no, I'm getting confused. The loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a variant. So Cre from the mouse, which is wild-type, can only cut loxP sites, but when you have lox2272, which is a mutant, Cre can't cut them unless it's a 'floxed' site—like if the construct has lox2272 on both ends, then Cre can't cut. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. 

The vector has the ligand and mCherry with a loxP-stop in between, and the receptor and eGFP with lox2272-stop in between. So when Cre is expressed, it will excise the loxP site but not the lox2272 site, because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Or wait, wait—actually, lox2272 is a variant that is compatible with Cre for recombination only when paired with another lox2272 site. Wait, no, I think that Cre can't recognize lox2272. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, loxP is the original site. lox2272 is a strain where the site has been mutated such that it is not cleaved by wild-type Cre. So a pair of loxP sites will be cut by Cre, but lox2272 sites won't unless the Cre is a mutant, like Cre/ER or something else. 

So in this case, the ligand ORF is after the CBA promoter. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette between them. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not because the stop is in the way. But if Cre is present, it would cut the loxP-stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. 

Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, which allows it to be expressed from the same mRNA as the ligand. The receptor is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So the eGFP would only be expressed if Cre is present to cut the stop. Wait, but Cre can't cut lox2272, right? So the eGFP would not be expressed unless the stop is removed. Unless I'm misunderstanding the setup. 

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. The ligand and receptor are on the same vector, each with their own stop cassettes. So when Cre is present, it would cut the loxP in the ligand's cassette, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor, Cre can't cut the lox2272, so the stop remains, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed. Or am I getting that backwards?

Wait, no, the lox2272 cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So normally, without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not because of the stop. If Cre is present, it would cut the lox2272, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But wait, no—because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272 sites, right? So the stop would remain, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed unless Cre can cut that. 

Wait, but the construct is in the vector. So the way it's set up: 

Ligand ORF (under CBA promoter) -> loxP-stop -> mCherry 
IRES 
Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop -> eGFP 

So if Cre is present, it will cut the loxP sites but not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut by Cre, so eGFP remains behind. So in the presence of Cre, you'd get ligand + mCherry and receptor + stop, so no eGFP. 

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the IRES is after the ligand and before the receptor. So both ligand and receptor are expressed from the same mRNA, but the IRES allows internal initiation for the receptor. So the mRNA is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> IRES -> receptor ORF. 

But then between ligand and mCherry is a loxP stop cassette. So if Cre is present, that stop is removed, and mCherry is expressed in the same transcript as the ligand. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272 stop. So for the eGFP to be expressed, the stop must be removed. But since Cre doesn't cut lox2272, the eGFP won't be expressed. 

Wait no, maybe the lox2272 is in the other orientation. Oh, right, lox2272 is a site that can be recognized if paired with another lox2272, but Cre can't recognize it alone. So if the vector has lox2272 before and after the eGFP, then Cre can't excise it because it can't recognize that site. 

So in the mouse model, they're homozygous for the construct. Now they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, leading to excision of the lox sites. 

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand's lox is loxP, so Cre can cut that, but the receptor's is lox2272, so Cre can't. So the ligand's ORF would be expressed along with mCherry, because the stop is cut. The receptor's ORF would not be expressed along with eGFP, because the stop is in the way and Cre can't cut it. 

Wait, no, the IRES is before the receptor. So the receptor is expressed regardless, but the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is cut. Since the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, which Cre can't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the offspring, they're looking for eGFP expression, which isn't happening, so no green signal. 

So why don't they see eGFP? Because the eGFP isn't being expressed. The options are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Hmm, that's about function, not expression. They're looking for expression, not function.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean no GFP on the cell surface, but maybe in the cytoplasm. But why no expression at all?

C) enhancer missing. The promoter is CBA, which is strong, so probably not enhancer issues.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly spliced, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Or perhaps the stop codon is in the way.

Wait, the construct for the receptor is ORF followed by lox2272-stop. So the receptor is correctly in frame, but the eGFP is after the stop. So without excision, the eGFP isn't expressed. If Cre isn't cutting the lox2272 (which it can't), then the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Wait, but the vector has the ligand under CBA, followed by loxP-stop, then mCherry; then IRES; then receptor ORF, followed by lox2272-stop, then eGFP. 

In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is excised, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. The receptor's stop, being lox2272, isn't excised, so the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. 

Wait, but wait, the IRES is after the ligand. So the mRNA starts with the ligand, then the IRES allows the ribosome to switch and start translating the receptor. So in the absence of any Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry would not because of the stop. The receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP would not. So when Cre is present, ligand and mCherry are expressed, but receptor and eGFP aren't, because the eGFP's stop isn't cut. 

Wait no, no. If Cre is present, it cuts the loxP in the ligand's cassette, so ligand and mCherry are expressed. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but the eGFP is after a lox2272 stop. Since Cre can't cut that, the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, when they express Cre, they'd get ligand and mCherry, but not receptor and eGFP? Or no, wait: the ligand and receptor are under the same vector. 

Wait, the vector has the ligand and receptor as two separate ORFs. The ligand is under CBA, then the IRES, then receptor. So the same mRNA is used for both, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be expressed. 

But then, the ligand is followed by the stop (loxP). So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed because of the IRES but eGFP isn't. 

When Cre is present, the loxP is cut, so mCherry is expressed with the ligand. The lox2272 isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, the Cre is expressed (since they crossed with SOX10-Cre), so they should see ligand and mCherry, but not eGFP. 

But the question is, why isn't the eGFP expressed? The options are: 

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF isn't in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the construct, the receptor is correctly followed by eGFP in frame, because the stop is in between. Wait, no, the eGFP is after the lox2272 stop, which is not being cut. So the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is in the way. 

Wait, but the lox2272 is a stop cassette. So the mRNA for the receptor would terminate at the stop, so the eGFP isn't made. Unless the stop is cut. 

So in the mouse, the Cre is present, but it can't cut the lox2272. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason for no green signal is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. 

Looking at the options: 

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could be an issue if the ORF isn't correctly spliced. But if the stop is in between, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless of the frame. 

Alternatively, another possibility is that the vector is designed such that the eGFP is only expressed when the lox2272 is cut. But since Cre can't cut it, the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Wait, but the question is why isn't the eGFP expressed after the Cre is expressed. Because the lox2272 wasn't cut. So the construct probably didn't excise the stop, so the eGFP isn't made. 

Looking at the options, the only one that relates to the expression of eGFP is option D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, option B says the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But why would that happen? If the eGFP isn't even made, it wouldn't be stuck anywhere. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. The reason is that the stop cassette isn't being cut, so the eGFP isn't made. 

Wait, but why isn't the stop cassette being cut? Because the lox sites are incompatible. Oh, wait! The lox sites are different. The ligand's stop is loxP, which Cre can cut. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So the eGFP remains under the stop. 

Therefore, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because Cre can't remove the lox2272 stop. So the eGFP isn't present. 

Looking back at the options, none of them directly state that. The options are: 

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Doesn't explain the expression issue. 

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If they were expressed, but not at cell surface. But why would they not be expressed at all? 

C) enhancer missing. The promoter is CBA, which is strong; probably not. 

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they were, the eGFP wouldn't be made, but the issue is that the stop isn't being cut. 

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the construct didn't recombine because the lox sites aren't compatible, so the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Wait, but the question states that they used a bicistronic vector with lox sites. They are using SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells. Cre should be active in the cells where the ligand and receptor are expressed. 

So the eGFP should only be expressed if the lox2272 is cut. But since Cre can't cut lox2272, the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the reason is that the stop cassette isn't excised because the lox2272 isn't compatible with Cre. 

But looking at the options, none directly state that. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So why would the ORF not be in frame? Because the stop is in between. 

Alternatively, perhaps the design of the vector is wrong. For the ligand and mCherry, the stop is loxP, so Cre can cut that, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor and eGFP, the stop is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. 

So the reason there's no green signal is that the eGFP isn't expressed. The options don't directly address this, but the only possible option that relates is D. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is wrong. 

Wait, another thought: in the construct, the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, but the stop is in between, so without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed. The receptor is at 3' with eGFP, with a lox2272 stop. Cre can't cut the lox2272, so eGFP isn't expressed. So when you use Cre, you only get ligand and mCherry expressed, not the receptor or eGFP. But the question is about the receptor and eGFP. So they're looking for the receptor-eGFP expression, but it's not there. 

So the reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut. Since the lox sites are incompatible, the eGFP isn't expressed. 

But looking at the options again, the only one that relates is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that would mean the ORF is interrupted, so the eGFP isn't made. So perhaps the correct answer is D. 

Alternatively, maybe the expression is not happening because the promoter is missing. If the CBA promoter is only for the ligand. So the receptor is expressed via IRES, which is fine. So the issue isn't the enhancer, so C is probably not correct. 

So the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present and not cut. Which would imply that the eGFP isn't being made. 

So which option relates to this? Only option D and B. 

Wait, another angle: the lox2272 is a stop cassette, but perhaps the construct is designed so that the eGFP is only expressed when the lox sites are cut. But if the lox2272 can't be cut, eGFP isn't expressed. So why would that be? Because Cre can't recognize lox2272. 

But the options don't have that. Looking again: 

The answer is either B or D. 

Option B: receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP isn't expressed, then it can't be stuck in Golgi. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. Which suggests that the stop isn't cut. 

But none of the options directly address that. 

Wait, maybe the issue is that the stop cassette isn't flanked by functional lox sites. For example, the lox2272 is only present on one side, so Cre can't cut it. So the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. 

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector didn't recombine because the lox sites are different. So the eGFP isn't expressed. 

But the options don't directly address this either. 

After considering all this, I think the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop is preventing expression, which may be because the construct wasn't properly recombined. 

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop (loxP) is cut, but the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the reason is that the stop isn't cut, leading to eGFP not being expressed. 

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is D. Or perhaps the answer is B. 

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is not expressed because the stop isn't cut, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the most likely explanation is that the eGFP isn't being transcribed or translated. 

But the only options given are A to D. 

So, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll go with option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the ORF isn't correctly spliced, the eGFP won't be expressed. So the answer is D.


The question involves understanding why no green signal (eGFP) is observed in a mouse model expressing a ligand-receptor pair. The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF under the CBA promoter, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF under the IRES, fused to eGFP. Between the ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the stop cassettes, but no green signal was observed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:
   - The ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES element.
   - The ligand-mCherry fusion is separated by a loxP-stop cassette, which Cre can excise, allowing mCherry expression.
   - The receptor-eGFP fusion is separated by a lox2272-stop cassette, which Cre cannot excise because lox2272 is not recognized by wild-type Cre.

2. **Cre Activity**:
   - SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, where Cre excises the loxP-stop cassette, allowing mCherry expression.
   - However, Cre cannot excise the lox2272-stop cassette, so the eGFP remains under the stop, preventing its expression.

3. **Expression Outcomes**:
   - After Cre excision, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not, as the lox2272-stop cassette prevents eGFP expression.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This describes their interaction but does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This implies improper trafficking but does not explain why eGFP is not expressed at all.
   - **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The CBA promoter is strong, so this is unlikely.
   - **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**: If the ORF is disrupted, eGFP would not be expressed. However, the primary issue is the stop cassette preventing expression, not frame alignment.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression is that Cre cannot excise the lox2272-stop cassette, leaving the stop in place and preventing eGFP expression. Among the options, **D) the receptor and eGFP are not in frame** is the closest explanation, as it implies a disruption in expression.
