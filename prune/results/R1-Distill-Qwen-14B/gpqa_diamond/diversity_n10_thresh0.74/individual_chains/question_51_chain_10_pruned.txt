Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, okay, I remember that when charges are placed near conductors, there's some induced charge stuff that happens. 

Wait, the sphere is grounded. Oh right, a grounded conductor means that any excess charge can flow to the ground. So, if a charge is placed near it, the sphere will induce some charges on its surface. But since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. That's important because the potential of a conducting sphere is the same throughout, and when grounded, it adjusts to maintain that.

So, the setup is: a charge q is outside a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charges will flow away except for whatever is induced by the charge q. Wait, no. Wait, when you have a charge near a conductor, the conductor's free electrons move. If the conductor is neutral, the induced charges will be opposite to the charge outside. But since the sphere is grounded, those induced charges can leave the sphere, so the sphere ends up with a certain charge.

Wait, maybe I should think about image charges. Oh, right! For a conducting sphere, the method of images can be used to find induced charges. The image charge for a point charge q outside a conducting sphere of radius R would be another charge -q', but wait, no. I think the image charge for a conducting sphere
