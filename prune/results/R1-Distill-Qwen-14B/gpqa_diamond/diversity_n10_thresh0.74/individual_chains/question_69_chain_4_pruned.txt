Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in particle physics, when particles decay, their lifetime can be affected by their velocity relative to the observer. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, but when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed (the lab frame) is longer due to time dilation.

So the key here is probably using the time dilation formula. I think the formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is calculated as E/(m c²), but wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, gamma is E divided by the rest mass energy, because E = γ m c². So for a particle, if E is its total energy, then γ = E/(m c²).

Wait, but in the problem, the energy given is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy of the X⁰ particle? I suppose so. So the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So first, I can compute γ as 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Hmm. 3.41 is approximately 3.4. 27 / 3.4 is about 7.94? Because 3.4 * 8 is 27.2, so a bit less. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

But wait, the units: GeV divided by GeV cancels, so γ is unitless as expected.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame would be τ = γ τ₀. So τ is approximately 7.9 times 8e-16 seconds. Let me compute that: 7.9 * 8e-16 = 63.2e-16, which is 6.32e-15 seconds.

But what's the question again? The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, that's about the detection resolution. So I think this relates to the time it takes for the particle to decay, and whether the detector can resolve that.

Wait, but more accurately, the number of particles that decay before leaving the detector is important. Or wait, perhaps it's about the length the particle travels before decaying, and the detector's spatial resolution needs to be able to see that.

Wait, no, the question is about the minimum resolution needed. I think I need to calculate the decay length, which is how far the particle travels before decaying. So the decay length L is given by L = v * τ, where v is the velocity
