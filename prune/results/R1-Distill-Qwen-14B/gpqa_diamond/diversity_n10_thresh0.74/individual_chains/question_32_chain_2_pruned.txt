Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that particles in colliders are accelerated to relativistic speeds, so I guess I'll need to use some special relativity here.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the mass number 3 + 3 = 6, so it's Li-6. Oh yeah, the isotope with 3 neutrons is Li-6.

So the first thing I think I need to do is find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. But wait, how do I get that? I know that the mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy, but maybe for this problem, I can approximate the mass using the average of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, actually, the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass should be 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me compute that. 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV/c². Oh wait, but wait, because the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less because of binding energy. But maybe for this calculation, we can just use the sum of the individual masses. Or perhaps the problem expects me to take the mass as 6 * m_nucleon, where m_nucleon is approximately 938 MeV/c².

Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the mass somewhere, but the prompt doesn't say. Oh wait, the problem statement only mentions that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So I think I need to proceed with this approximation.

So, mass m = 6 * 938 MeV/c² = 5628 MeV/c², which is 5.628 GeV/c².

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c. I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. In relativity, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy mc².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So plugging in v=0.96c, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. The square root of 0.0784.

Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)
