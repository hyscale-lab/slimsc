Okay, I'm trying to figure out this SMEFT symmetry question. So, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you write down all possible interactions allowed by certain symmetries.

The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, Lorentz and Poincare are related. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in quantum field theory, when you're talking about symmetries that operators must respect, I think that Poincare is more general. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy theory, so maybe it's formulated in a way that assumes Poincare symmetry.

Wait, no. SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory that respects the Standard Model's symmetries. The Standard Model has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT would inherit that. But wait, Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. But the operators in SMEFT are local, so they should transform covariantly under Poincare. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz.

But wait, the question asks which symmetries must be respected. So, if Poincare includes Lorentz, then do both 1 and 2 have to be respected? Or is it that Poincare is the broader symmetry, so respecting Poincare automatically includes Lorentz.

Looking back, the options include 1 and 2 as separate options. So the question is, in SMEFT, which of these symmetries must be respected by all operators.

I think that Poincare symmetry (option 2) is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz (option 1). So if an operator respects Poincare, does that mean it automatically respects Lorentz? Because Lorentz is part of Poincare.

Wait, but the question lists them as separate options. So maybe the correct answer includes both Lorentz and Poincare. Or perhaps SMEFT only requires Lorentz symmetry, not necessarily Poincare beyond that.

Wait, no, Poincare symmetry is about the entire spacetime, including translations. So all operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare, which implies they also respect Lorentz. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz.

But the question is a bit tricky. Which of the options must be respected. So, if an operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare, then it must respect both Poincare and Lorentz. But the options are presented as separate choices. So the correct symmetries would be 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects the Standard Model gauge symmetry plus Lorentz, but not necessarily Poincare. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers specifically to the symmetries that SMEFT respects beyond the gauge symmetries. Wait, SMEFT's operators are built respecting the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model and also Lorentz symmetry. But I'm not sure about Poincare.

Wait, let me think about the structure of SMEFT. SMEFT is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, such that these operators are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model includes Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must also respect that.

Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, so 2 is a must, and hence 1 is also a must because it's part of 2. But wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 1 and 2.

Option C is 1,2,4.

So if 2 is included, that would imply 1 is also a must. But perhaps the question is whether Poincare is the same as Lorentz. Hmm, no. Poincare includes Lorentz, but also includes translations.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in SMEFT, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, but not necessarily Poincare. Because Poincare symmetry includes translations, which in effective field theories are usually broken because the theory is not valid at all scales. SMEFT is an effective theory valid below a certain scale, so maybe it doesn't necessarily respect Poincare symmetry, but it does respect Lorentz. Or perhaps the operators are constructed in such a way that they respect both because they are written in a local way.

Wait, but operators in a local QFT must respect Poincare. Because Poincare includes translations, and local theories work covariantly. So SMEFT is a local effective field theory, so all operators must transform covariantly under Poincare. That includes Lorentz.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4? Wait, what about CPT symmetry.

Wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So, considering CPT symmetry—does SMEFT respect CPT?

The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, except maybe for some theories with Majorana masses, but in the Standard Model, CPT is respected. So SMEFT, being an effective theory of the Standard Model, would also respect CPT symmetry, so operators must be CPT-symmetric.

Wait, but not all possible operators would necessarily respect CPT. Wait, no, because in the Standard Model, all operators are CPT-symmetric. So in SMEFT, any operator you write must be consistent with CPT symmetry as well. Because otherwise, it would break the Standard Model's symmetry.

So, I'm getting that all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But what about CP (3). The question is, do SMEFT operators respect CP symmetry?

The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, the CKM matrix has CP violation. So if the operators in SMEFT are CP even or odd, they can violate CP. But does each operator individually have to respect CP? Or is it that the theory as a whole respects CP, but individual operators might change that.

Wait, no. The operators in SMEFT can have different CP properties. For example, some operators are CP-even, others are CP-odd. So the theory doesn't require each operator to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, the operators need not respect CP. So option 3 is not a must.

So which options are correct?

The symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT).

Wait, but wait. Poincare includes Lorentz. So if all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz, then including 2 would make 1 automatically correct. But the question is, do they have to separately respect Lorentz? Or is 2 implying 1.

So the options are that the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option C, which says 1,2,4.

But wait, another thought: does SMEFT respect CPT symmetry? Because the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, the operators added in SMEFT must not violate CPT, because that would cause issues. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So, the correct answer would be 1, 2, and 4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is required, not Poincare. Because Poincare includes translations, but in an effective theory, the translations are broken by the presence of a cutoff scale, so perhaps SMEFT doesn't require Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but that's not right. Effective field theories are still local, so they must respect Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes the local symmetries of spacetime. So all operators must transform correctly under Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translations.

So, the correct symmetries are 1,2, and 4, so option C is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

Option C) 1,2,4

Option D) 1,3,4

So, the correct answer would be option C, which includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again.

If SMEFT is an effective theory, it's written in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying theory, which is the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT must as well.

So, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So, 2 and 1.

Additionally, operators must respect CPT symmetry because the SM does, so 4.

So the correct options are 1, 2, 4. Which is option C.

But wait, let me check the choices again. The question lists four options:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So, option C is 1,2,4.

But another thought: does SMEFT include operators that violate CP? The SM allows for CP violation, so SMEFT would have operators that can violate CP. So, the operators themselves may not respect CP (so 3 is not a must), but they must respect CPT (4 is a must).

So, 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), 4 (CPT) must be respected.

Thus, the correct answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an effective field theory that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. Effective field theories are local and must respect spacetime symmetries such as Lorentz and Poincaré symmetry. Additionally, SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because the Standard Model itself is CPT symmetric. However, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators, as the Standard Model already includes CP-violating phenomena, such as those arising from the CKM matrix.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because it is part of the framework of local quantum field theory.  
2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations, is also required for SMEFT operators.  
3. **CP Symmetry (3):** SMEFT operators do not necessarily respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is already present in the Standard Model.  
4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, and SMEFT is derived from it.

### Conclusion:
The symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
