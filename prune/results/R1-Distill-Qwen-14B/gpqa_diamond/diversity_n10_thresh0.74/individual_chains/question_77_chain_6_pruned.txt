Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct major products from two different reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts: the first is about a reaction with BuLi and then H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement upon heating. The options are given as A and B, and I need to pick which option (A to D) is correct.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me try to visualize this structure. The benzene ring has a substituent: an OCH2 group attached, and that O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is like benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy, so the chain is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents.

Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH=CH-CH2? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but no, wait. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

But-2-en-1-yl would be: the first carbon (1) is attached to the oxygen, then the chain goes 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2
