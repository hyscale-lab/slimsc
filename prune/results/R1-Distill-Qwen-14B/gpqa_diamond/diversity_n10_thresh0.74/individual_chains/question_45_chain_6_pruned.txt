Okay, so I've got this problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And here, E is given as E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy is n² times E.

Wait, but these are four identical particles. Oh, right, identical particles have to obey either the Pauli exclusion principle (fermions) or Bose-Einstein statistics (bosons). But the question says spin-1/2 particles. Spin 1/2 means they're fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most one particle.

But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state depends only on the principal quantum number n, right? So each n can have a certain number of particles based on their spin. Spin-1/2 has two possible states: spin up and spin down. So for each n, you can have two particles with different spins.

So the particles are fermions, so each n can have up to two particles. So how do we arrange four particles in the lowest possible energy states?

Let me think about the ground state first. Ground state means the lowest possible energy configuration. So we need to fill the lowest available n's, each with two particles each (since each n can hold two spins).

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (same)
Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. Wait, n=1 can hold 2, n=2 can hold 2. So that's four particles. So the total energy would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait another thought. No, each particle's energy is n² E. So for each n, each particle in that state contributes n² E. So for n=1, two particles: 2*(1² E) = 2E. For n=2, two particles: 2*(4 E) = 8E. So total ground state energy is 2E +8E=1
