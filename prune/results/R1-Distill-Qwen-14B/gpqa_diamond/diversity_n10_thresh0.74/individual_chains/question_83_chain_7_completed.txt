Alright, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it methodically.

Okay, the problem says we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on dilution. So, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ water. So total volume is 40 cm³. 

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. Wait, but volume is in cm³, which is mL. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). Hmm, wait, no. Wait, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, wait, that's 0.025 M acetic acid, right?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then when we add 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ = 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So yes, 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So first, let's find the pH at 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of what? Oh, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, at this point, how much acetic acid and acetate have we consumed?

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH added in 2.5 cm³ is 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, we'll have 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol of acetic acid left, and 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) produced.

But wait, the total volume at this point is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, actually, when you mix the NaOH with the diluted acetic acid, you have to consider the dilution correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of moles.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. Oh wait, no. 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. Because the equivalence point is when all acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, but the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added, which means 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol has reacted, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

The total solution volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³.

So,

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M,

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, to find pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, which is approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first pH. But let me check the other options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92

So the first part is around 4.25, which is close to 4.26 (option A). Now I need to check the equivalence point pH.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

The moles of sodium acetate are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH at equivalence) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction can be modeled using the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, and since Kb is very small, we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So,

x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 ≈ 1.081e-11

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

Then pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options for equivalence point are 8.52, 6.73, 7, 6.92.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-calculate Kb.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use the exact expression instead of the approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

So,

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, which gives x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH ≈9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. That's a problem. The options given don't have anything near 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa - pKw + pKa?)

Wait, no. Wait, the pH of a solution of a salt can be found by considering the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the concentration of OH^- from the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

So the calculation seems right. So then why do the options not have 9.02 as pH? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dilution steps.

Wait, at equivalence, the total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M acetate. Correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial calculation of moles is wrong.

Wait, initial solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, making total 40 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Then, at equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is converted to acetate. So 0.001 mol in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating pOH.

Wait, [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH 9.02. But in the options, the equivalence pH is up to 8.52 in option A. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let me check if the acetate solution is correct.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation more accurately, without approximation.

The equation is x²/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Let me assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. As before.

But maybe the approximation isn't good, so let's solve the quadratic equation.

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x).

Expanding: x² = 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x.

Bring all terms to left: x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Calculate:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.921e-19,

4 * 1.081e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11.

So D ≈ 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since the first term is negligible).

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ]/(2).

Taking positive root: x ≈ (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So x ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485 → pH ≈ 14 -5.485=8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

Ah! Okay, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not considering the quadratic properly. So the correct pH at equivalence is around 8.52, which is option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I got pH≈9, but the more accurate calculation gives pH≈8.52. So that aligns with option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the pH at 25% is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52. So that would match.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the pH at 25% titration, I got around 4.25, which is very close to 4.26.

So the first value is 4.26 (approx) and the equivalence is 8.52. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps for the 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume is added.

Equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. After reaction, moles of HA = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of A^- = 0.00025.

Total volume now is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log(0.005882/0.017647).

0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771.

pKa is around 4.73, so 4.73 -0.4771 = 4.2529, which is about 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but wait another thing. At the equivalence point, when the solution is sodium acetate, which is a weak base, the pH should be around 8.52, as we calculated. So that's correct.

But another thought: Could the initial pH after dilution be considered for the 25% titration?

Wait, no, because in the 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the solution is a buffer, and the Henderson equation applies. So the calculation seems correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH has been added. The equivalence point is reached when all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized by 0.1 M NaOH, requiring:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence point volume is:

\[
0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and produces:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio is approximately \(0.3333\), and \(\log(0.3333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([OH^-] = x\). At equilibrium:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x \ll 0.02\), we approximate \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x \approx 0.02\):

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \approx 1.082 \times 10^{-11},
\]
\[
x \approx \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 \approx 9.02.
\]

However, solving the quadratic equation more accurately gives:

\[
x \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.485 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer

**A) 4.26; 8.52**

**B) 3.17; 6.73**

**C) 4.73; 7.00**
