Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Let me think through each compound one by one.

First, optical activity is about whether a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually means the compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry leading to enantiomers. So each compound needs to have at least one chiral center or another form of stereoisomerism that leads to optical activity. Wait, but wait—could something else cause optical activity? Oh, maybe if there's a plane of symmetry or not. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral, so no optical activity.

Let me go through each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Hmm, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, the double bond is at position 1, so the structure is Cl attached to the same carbon as the double bond. Wait, but for (Z) configuration, the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. But does the molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The structure is CH2Cl, connected to a CH(CH3), which is double-bonded to CH2. Wait, wait—no, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's butene, so four carbons. So positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. So carbon 1 is Cl-CH2-, and carbon 2 is C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but wait. Let me write it as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, position 1 is the double bond. The molecule is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to CH(CH3) or something else?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be:

Cl
|
CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? But that would be but-1-ene, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's three carbons, maybe. Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So:

It's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no. Let me get this right. The correct structure for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is:

The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, and C2 is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's actually three carbons. Oh wait, no, the but-1-ene has four carbons. So:

The structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would only be three carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but regardless of the structure, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a molecule to have optical activity, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center.

In the case of (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the substituents around the double bond are Cl on C1 and CH(CH3) on C2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. If the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, then the substituents on each double bond are: on C1, the groups are CH2Cl, and two Hs (since it's CH2Cl attached to the double bond). On C2, the groups are CH(CH3), and another CH2.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this differently. For a molecule to have a chiral center, it must have four different groups attached to a carbon. So in this case, the chlorine is on a CH2 group. Let's see: The Cl is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So C1 is CH2Cl connected to the double bond. So C1's groups are two Hs, a Cl, and the double bond. So that's three groups and the double bond. Wait, but that's only three substituents, so C1 can't be a chiral center because it's double-bonded (so it's sp² hybridized), and that carbon isn't a chiral center. The same applies to C2. So, no chiral centers in this molecule. So it can't be optically active. Wait, but what about the possibility of E/Z isomerism? Well, E/Z isomerism doesn't make a molecule chiral. Chirality requires a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry, like a plane of symmetry being absent.

So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. So the first compound: no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me think. The structure has a methano ring fused, perhaps. The substituents are a chloromethylene group, which is CH2Cl. The E configuration suggests that the groups on either side of the double bond are opposite. But does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Or a chiral center?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicyclic compound. The methanoisobenzofuran part suggests a fused ring system with two rings. The substituent is a chloromethylene group attached at position 8. The E configuration would place the chlorine on the opposite side of the ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this molecule is planar or has a center of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridged bicyclic structure, which could lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Or maybe the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center somewhere. The substituents are 3aR and 7aS. So positions 3a and 7a have specific configurations. So that would imply that those carbons are chiral centers. Wait, but in bridged bicyclic systems, sometimes bridgehead carbons can be chiral if they have four different substituents.

If 3a and 7a are chiral centers, then the molecule would have two chiral centers. So it would be chiral, hence optically active.

So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but the (E) configuration is also part of the name. So perhaps that affects the symmetry. Hmm, but even with E configuration, if the molecule has a chiral center, it's still chiral. So I think this one is active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Now, substituting methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3. So the structure would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, but wait, wait: the positions are 2 and 3. So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? Or maybe HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but for succinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if you have methyl groups on 2 and 3, that would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH? Wait, but that would make each of those CH(CH3) groups. Wait, but wait, in the compound, it's 2R and 3S configuration.

So each of those carbons (C2 and C3) would have four different groups? Let's see: C2 would be connected to:

- The COOH group (from C1),
- Two CH3 groups (if it's CH(CH3)2?), wait no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 as substituents.

So each of C2 and C3 would have the following substituents:

C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3, and two methyl groups? No, wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then C2 and C3 each have a methyl group. So C2 would be CH(CH3), and C3 would be CH(CH3). But in succinic acid, the chain is four carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (COOH). So adding a methyl to C2 and C3 would make them CH2 become CH(CH3).

Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if you add a methyl to C2, it becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. But wait, the question says 2,3-dimethyl, so both have methyl groups. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no. Because the positions are 2 and 3 on the four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but each of these CH(CH3) groups would have the same substituents, right? Let me look at C2: what groups are attached? The groups are:

- One HOOC (from C1),
- One CH(CH3) (from C3),
- Two methyl groups? No, because each CH(CH3) has one methyl, and the other is the CH group.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. For C2: the four groups are:

- The carboxylic acid group (from C1),
- The CH(CH3) group (from C3),
- Two methyl groups attached to C2? No, that can't be. Wait, no—because the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle two carbons (C2 and C3) have a CH(CH3) group. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (C3),
- Two Hs? Or perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to draw it. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So for C2, the substituents are:

- One COOH (on the left),
- One CH(CH3) (on the right),
- Two CH3 groups? No, that's not correct. Wait, no: each C2 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

- The left is a COO- group (from C1),
- The right is a CH(CH3) (from C3),
- And two Hs attached to C2? Wait, no, because CH(CH3) has three substituents: CH2 can't be. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the correct structure is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R configuration)-CH(CH3)(S configuration)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a CH(CH3) group. So each has:

- Two methyl groups? No, wait. Each CH(CH3) has one methyl group and two Hs. Hmm, no, wait. The formula for each CH(CH3) would be CH with one methyl and two hydrogens. Or wait, maybe each is CH2 with a methyl? No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to determine if each of these carbons in the succinic acid is a chiral center. So for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

So looking at C2: it is attached to:

- The C1 (which is a COOH group),
- The C3 (which is another CH(CH3)),
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each CH(CH3) is attached to two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) is attached to one methyl group, and the other substituents are the two adjacent carbons and a hydrogen. So the substituents for C2 are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- a methyl group,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so that's four different groups: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So C2 would be a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would be attached to:

- CH(CH3) (from C2),
- COOH (from C4),
- a methyl group,
- and a hydrogen.

So also four different substituents. So both C2 and C3 are chiral centers. But wait, the molecule as a whole—does it have a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral despite the two chiral centers?

The molecule is (2R,3S). So the configuration is R and S respectively. Let's imagine the structure. The molecule is symmetric around the center. The substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images. So if the configurations are R and S, would that create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if C2 is R and C3 is S, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry between them, making it a meso compound. Because the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. So the molecule would be achiral, despite having two chiral centers.

Wait, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it has two chiral centers with R and S configurations. So if the two chiral centers are arranged symmetrically, the molecule is meso and not chiral.

So in this case, because the configurations are R and S, and the molecule is symmetric, it would be a meso compound. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait: the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same, so if the configurations are R and S, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central axis, making it meso. Hence, no optical activity. So this compound would not be optically active.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the molecule has two chiral centers and is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. So yes, this one is not optically active.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on both C2 and C3 are the same: each has a methyl group, a COOH group, a CH(CH3), and a hydrogen. So when the configurations are R and S, the molecule becomes meso.

So yes, no optical activity for this compound.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

So same structure as the previous compound, but both configurations are R.

So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)(R)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

Now, looking for symmetry. Since both chiral centers are R, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize: each of the CH(CH3) groups are on the same side relative to their respective adjacent carbons.

So without a plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral. So this would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait: what about the possibility of a plane of symmetry in this configuration? If the two R configurations are on the same side, perhaps leading to an overall symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral and thus optically active. Because both chiral centers have the same configuration, making the molecule lack a plane of symmetry. So yes, this compound would be optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

So this is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1, and the configuration is R.

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C1. Now, would this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see.

The OH is on C1. What are the substituents on C1?

In a cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring. So for C1 (with the OH), the substituents would be:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (or perhaps other substituents, depending on the ring structure),
- and a CH group if the ring has a double bond.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the actual substituents. In the chair conformation, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the structure.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2 connected to C3),
- C6 (which is CH2 connected to C5),
- and the double bond between C3 and C4, so maybe C2 is connected to C3, which is double-bonded to C4.

Wait, but for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
- and a CH group (from C3, which is part of the double bond). Hmm, but wait, C3 is part of the double bond, so it's sp² hybridized. So C1 is sp³, attached to C2 and C6, which are each CH2 groups, and the OH, and also attached to C3, which is part of the double bond. So the substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring (which is a cyclohexene, so perhaps the ring itself introduces some substituents).

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether C1 has four different groups. The substituents would be:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups,
- and a CH group (from C3, which is part of the double bond). Wait, no, because C3 is double-bonded to C4, so C3 is sp² hybridized. So the groups attached to C1 are:

- OH,
- C2 (which is a CH2 group),
- C6 (another CH2 group),
- and C3 (which is a CH group as part of the double bond).

Wait, but if C3 is part of the double bond, is that a CH group that's attached to C1? So the substituents on C1 are OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and CH (C3). So that's four different groups, making C1 a chiral center.

So (R) configuration implies that the molecule is chiral, so it would exhibit optical activity.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is s for each.

Now, would this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The positions are 1,3,5, which are all alternating, so they form a trigonal arrangement on the ring. So the molecule would look like a six-membered ring with OH groups every other carbon. But does this create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, in a cyclohexane ring, if three substituents are placed every other carbon (like 1,3,5), the molecule would be symmetric. Because each substituent is opposite another. Wait, but with all three substituents in the same configuration (all s), perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, if all three OH groups are on the same face (all axial or all equatorial), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the configurations are such that the substituents mirror each other, it could be a meso compound.

Wait, let me consider the structure. Each OH is on a carbon in a symmetric position. So for 1,3,5-triol, each is opposite another. Wait, no, because in a six-membered ring, 1 and 4 are opposite, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. So 1,3,5 would each be separated by two positions, so they're all adjacent in a way that's symmetric.

Wait, but the configuration of each OH is s. So their positions would be either all R or all S, but in this case, all s. But regardless, the key is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the three OH groups are in equivalent positions and their configurations are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each is mirrored across some axis.

Wait, perhaps if the molecule has a plane of symmetry through a carbon, then it's achiral. For instance, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, making it achiral despite having chiral centers.

Wait, let's think about the number of chiral centers. Each of the three OHs is on a chiral center. Wait, are they chiral centers?

Each of C1, C3, and C5 has an OH group. Let's check if each is a chiral center. For C1, substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (CH2 group),
- C6 (CH2 group),
- and a hydrogen? Or perhaps another group.

Wait, no, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and to two other substituents. So the substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen? Or perhaps another substituent. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the cyclohexane ring has each carbon connected to two adjacent carbons and two hydrogens (if it's a chair conformation). But when there's a substituent like OH, that takes the place of a hydrogen.

So for C1, the substituents would be:

- OH,
- C2 (which is a CH2 group),
- C6 (another CH2 group),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would make four different substituents, so C1 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 and C5 would also be chiral centers. So the molecule has three chiral centers.

Now, the configurations are all s. So 1s,3s,5s.

Now, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on 1,3,5. Each is a chiral center, but arranged symmetrically. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound.

Wait, for example, if the configurations are such that each pair of opposite chiral centers are mirror images, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, but in this case, all three OHs are on the same face (since they are all s), perhaps leading to no symmetry. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not planar and therefore chiral.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about whether the molecule is achiral. For example, if all three OHs are on the same face, the molecule might exhibit a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry. So I'm a bit stuck here. Another approach: if the molecule has an even number of chiral centers arranged symmetrically, it might be a meso compound. But with three chiral centers, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the molecule does have a plane of symmetry. Let me consider that: if you have a plane that goes through the center of the ring and the opposite positions, then the arrangement of the substituents could mirror each other. But for three substituents, that might not be possible.

Wait, another way: if the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees around the ring, then it would have a plane of symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of three chiral centers arranged in a symmetric pattern would result in the molecule being achiral. But I'm uncertain.

Wait, let's think about the configurations. All three are s. If the substituents are arranged in a way that their configurations mirror each other across a plane, then the molecule would be achiral. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is optically active because it lacks a plane of symmetry. So this would be a chiral molecule, hence optically active.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of an example. For example, 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane. If all OHs are axial, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the center, making it achiral. But if they're all equatorial, perhaps it's also symmetric.

Wait, but with all OHs on the same face (axial), perhaps the molecule is symmetric, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, so it's not chiral.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the exact structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is on the first carbon, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. Wait, but butanone is four carbons. So:

The structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For butan-1-one, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH2-C(O)-R? Wait no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-R, but that's not correct. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, so it's (R)-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but in this case, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would be:

Cyclopentyl
|
C(O)
|
CH(CH3)
|
CH2

Wait, that can't be because butanone has four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's:

Cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

The ketone group is on C1. So, C1 is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a carbonyl group. Then, C2 is connected to a methyl group and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let me try to write the structure:

Butan-1-one is (CH₂)₃CO-. But with substituents. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1, which is a ketone (C=O). Then, C2 is CH₂, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is another CH₂.

Wait, but the actual structure should be:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4 (CH3).

Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH₂)₂CH₂-C(=O)-R. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, but that would be five carbons, but butanone is four. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the molecule has a chiral center.

So, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is on C1. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. C3 has a methyl group and is connected to C2 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4 (CH3).

So, C3 is connected to C2, C4, a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So substituents on C3: CH2 (from C2), CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and H. So four different groups? No, because two are CH3.

Wait, substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- CH3 (methyl group),
- H.

So that's three different groups (CH2, CH3, and H), making it not a chiral center. So C3 is not a chiral center.

What about C2? C2 is connected to C1 (cyclopentyl-C=O), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two Hs. So substituents: C1 (a large group), C3 (another group), and two Hs. So three different groups; hence, not a chiral center.

So the molecule lacks a chiral center. Therefore, it cannot be optically active.

Wait, but wait: what about the cyclopentyl group? Could that contribute to asymmetry? The cyclopentyl group itself is a ring, but unless it's substituted in a way that creates a chiral center, it's not chiral. So the entire molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. So it's not optically active.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's four carbons: C1 (cyclopentyl), C2 (C=O), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, but where is the methyl group? On C4. So the substituents on C4 would be:

- CH(CH3),
- CH2 (from C3),
- and two Hs. So that's three substituents, not four. So no chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. It seems that this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Now, let me tally up the number of optically active compounds.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-... : No (meso).
4. (2R,3R)-... : Yes.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-... : Not sure, but I think No. Because all OHs on same face, which might make it symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. Or it's chiral. Hmm, I'm still unsure. Alternatively, perhaps it's not chiral because it's symmetric.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No.

Wait, let me reevaluate compound 6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

If all three OH groups are on the same face (all axial or all equatorial), would that create a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups on 1,3,5. If they are all axial, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring. Because each OH is opposite another, but since all are axial, their arrangement mirrors across the plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because it's symmetric, making it a meso compound.

But wait, three chiral centers can't form a meso compound because meso compounds have even numbers of chiral centers. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral and thus optically active. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of another example: 1,2,3-trihydroxypropane. That's a triol with three chiral centers, and it's a meso compound because of internal symmetry. So perhaps a similar situation applies here.

In the case of 1,3,5-triol cyclohexane, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could be a meso compound. So perhaps this compound is achiral and thus not optically active.

If that's the case, then compound 6 is not optically active.

So, tallying up:

Compounds 2,4,5 are optically active. That's 3.

Wait, let me double-check:

Compound 2: Yes (chiral centers at 3a and 7a).

Compound 4: Yes (two R configurations making it chiral).

Compound 5: Yes (chiral center at C1).

Others: No.

So that's three compounds.

Wait, but wait, what about compound 6, if I'm wrong about it?

If compound 6 is optically active, then the count would be four.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's not active because it's a meso compound. But I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

In that case, compound 6 would be optically active, making the total four.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize the molecule. Imagine a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on positions 1,3,5. If all are in the same configuration (say, R), then the arrangement might not be symmetric, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I think the key here is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For a cyclohexane with substituents on 1,3,5, it's possible that a plane through the center of the ring would mirror the substituents. Since all OH groups are on the same face (all axial or all equatorial), the arrangement might be symmetric.

Wait, if all OHs are axial, then looking down the C1-C4 axis, the OHs on C1, C3, and C5 would be arranged in a symmetric way. So perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because each OH is on a different carbon with the same configuration, leading to no plane of symmetry.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for another approach. For a cyclohexane with three substituents on 1,3,5 positions, each with the same configuration (s), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps it's a meso compound, and thus not optically active.

If that's the case, then only three compounds are optically active.

So, the count is:

2,4,5: 3.

But let me recount:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. No.

7. No.

Total: 3.

So the answer would be 3, which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but another possibility: compound 6 might actually be chiral, making the total 4. So if the count is four, the answer would be D) 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in compound 6, the molecule is a meso compound, so not active. But if it's not a meso compound, then it is active.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has three chiral centers. For a molecule to be meso, it must have an even number. Wait, no, meso compounds can have any number of chiral centers as long as there's an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The number of chiral centers isn't a strict rule for meso compounds. For example, meso compounds can have two chiral centers (like tartaric acid) or more. So, having three chiral centers doesn't automatically disqualify a molecule from being meso.

So, for compound 6, if it has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound, making it achiral.

But how can three substituents create a plane of symmetry? I'm not sure. Perhaps not. Maybe there's no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because of the arrangement of substituents.

I think I'm stuck on this one. Maybe I should proceed with the initial count of three and see where that leads me.

So the answer options are:

A) 5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So according to my count, three compounds are optically active, which is option B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry, such as being a meso compound. Let us evaluate each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers. The double bond at position 1 prevents chirality, as the carbon is sp² hybridized. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a bicyclic compound with a chloromethylene group. The configurations at positions 3a and 7a suggest the presence of chiral centers. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two chiral centers at positions 2 and 3. However, the configurations (2R,3S) create a plane of symmetry, making the molecule a meso compound. Thus, it is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, this succinic acid derivative has two chiral centers. However, the configurations (2R,3R) do not create a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a cyclohexene ring with an OH group at position 1. The carbon at position 1 is a chiral center due to four different substituents (OH, two CH₂ groups, and the ring). The (R) configuration confirms chirality. Thus, it is **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 on a cyclohexane ring. Each of these positions is a chiral center. However, the symmetric arrangement of the OH groups (all in the same configuration) creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule a meso compound. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound does not have any chiral centers. The carbonyl group at position 1 and the substituents on the other carbons do not create asymmetry. Thus, it is **not optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**

This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.
