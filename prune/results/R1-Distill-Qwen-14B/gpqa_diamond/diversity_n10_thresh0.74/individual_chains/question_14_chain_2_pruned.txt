Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding the question.

So the scenario is that someone did a ChIP-seq experiment using PFA-fixed samples and an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After doing the usual steps like sequencing, quality control, alignment, and peak-calling, they found some peaks. But when they switched to using PFA plus DSG for fixation, those peaks disappeared. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

Hmm. I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common fixative used in ChIP experiments. It cross-links proteins to DNA, right? But wait, I think DSG is something else. DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide with glutaraldehyde, I think. Or maybe DSG is used in some other way. Oh wait, no, DSG is a crosslinker too, but it's more for proteins. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think. Oh wait, I think that PFA is used for crosslinking proteins to DNA, but sometimes in combination with DSG. Or maybe DSG is used for a different type of crosslinking.

Wait, another angle: crosslinking efficiency. Different fixatives can fix different types of interactions. So, for example, PFA might not efficiently crosslink certain types of chromatin interactions, like those that are more transient or in certain regions.

So the ChIP-seq was done with PFA, leading to peaks. But when they used PFA+DSG, the peaks disappeared. So perhaps the initial method (PFA alone) crosslinks some regions, but the addition of DSG affects this.

Wait, maybe I should think about the type of DNA regions that might be more accessible or less accessible under different fixation conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of DSG changes the crosslinking efficiency, leading to different regions being captured.

Wait, another thought: PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA. But sometimes, in some regions, especially repetitive regions, the DNA is more prone to forming secondary structures or is more condensed. So maybe PFA can't efficiently penetrate into those regions and crosslink the proteins there. So when you add DSG, which is a more efficient crosslinker for certain interactions, perhaps it allows for better crosslinking in regions that PFA couldn't reach, or maybe the opposite.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the initial PFA fixation allows the antibody to bind to regions where the transcription factor is more stably associated, but under the more stringent fixation with DSG, those regions are no longer bound. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, I remember that DSG is a stronger crosslinker compared to PFA. So maybe without DSG, some regions are not crosslinked as efficiently. So when you use PFA alone, you might miss some regions. But the question says that the peaks appeared when using PFA alone but disappeared when using PFA+DSG. So that suggests that in the second condition, the regions aren't being captured anymore.

Wait, maybe the regions that are only crosslinked under milder conditions. If DSG is a stronger crosslinker, perhaps it leads to more covalent bonds, but perhaps some regions are only captured under mild crosslinking.
