Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's try to tackle it step by step. 

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I know that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated using the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, the formula is actually DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, but in this case, I don't see any halogens (X) or nitrogen (N), so I can ignore those. So, it's DoU = (2C + 2 - H)/2. 

Wait, wait. Another version I remember is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But if there are no X or N, then it's (2C + 2 - H)/2. Right.

The problem is asking about the product when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, noâ€”I think it's the other way around. Oh right! Red phosphorus is used in the reaction with iodine to form the ylide, which is the phosphorus ylide. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is more commonly associated with the Wittig reaction. So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones by reacting them with a ylide.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has a formyl group. Formyl is an aldehyde group, right? So, the Wittig reaction would react the aldehyde with the ylide to form an alkene. So, the aldehyde (RCHO) would react with the ylide (which is generated from red phosphorus and HI) to form an alkene (RCH2CH2... wait, no. The Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes by replacing the carbonyl oxygen with a CH2 group. So, RCHO would become RCH2CH2 something? Wait, no, the ylide has a double bond. Oh, right, the general Wittig reaction is: 

R2C=O + PPh3CH2CH2... wait, no, more accurately, the ylide is something like PR3=CH-, and when it reacts with a carbonyl, like R'CO-R'', it forms R'CH=CH-R'' plus the phosphorus byproducts.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the structure must be a cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2CH- attached? Or maybe CH2=CH- as a substituent.

Wait, let's sketch this mentally. The cyc
