Okay, so I've got a quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because Hooke's law force would lead to a potential like (1/2) k r², and in this case, k would be m ω². So this is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz (or in spherical coordinates, maybe nl and something else). Wait, no, actually for the 3D isotropic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, another way: the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (n=0,1,2,...). Or maybe it's E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. Wait, I think the 3D isotropic oscillator has energy levels that are degenerate, with the energy depending on the sum of the principal quantum numbers.

Wait, in the three-dimensional case, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each of n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative
