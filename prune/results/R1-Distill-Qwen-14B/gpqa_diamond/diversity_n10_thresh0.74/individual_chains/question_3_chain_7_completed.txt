Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. So, expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula for expectation value is ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I guess I can split this into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each part. That is, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So first, I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. Remember that |a|² + |b|² should equal 1, because it's a normalized state. Let me check: 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. Yes, 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so that's good.

Now, σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ is just |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute that. |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, |b|^2 is ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's straightforward.

Now σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, σx has the property that it's the spin in the x-direction, and for a general state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) ??? Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the expectation value formula.

Wait, let's write σx in terms of its matrix. σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So when I compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's a*(a^* + b^*) + b*(a + b^*). Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as (a^* b + b^* a), because σx flips the spin. Let me think: σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So σx ψ = σx (a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩) = a σx |↑⟩ + b σx |↓⟩ = a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩.

Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a^* ⟨↑| + b^* ⟨↓|) (a |↓⟩ + b |↑⟩).

Multiplying this out, I get:

a^* a ⟨↑|↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↑|↑⟩ + b^* a ⟨↓|↓⟩ + b^* b ⟨↓|↑⟩.

But the inner product ⟨↑|↓⟩ is 0, so those first and last terms vanish. So we're left with a^* b (1) + b^* a (1). Since a and b are real numbers here (because the state is real, I think? The coefficients given are real), a^* is a and b^* is b. So it becomes a b + b a = 2 a b.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 2 a b.

Wait, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So a*b = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330. So 2 a b is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because another way to think about it: the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, so the expectation value of σx is (a^2 - b^2) * 2. Because, I think σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and for a state, the expectation is (|a|^2 - |b|^2) * 2? Wait, not sure. Let me compute:

In the σx basis, the eigenstates are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and |−x⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/sqrt(2). The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ would be the probability of |+x⟩ times +1 plus probability of |−x⟩ times -1. Alternatively, the general formula is ⟨σx⟩ = (|a|^2 - |b|^2) *2?

Wait, let's compute:

⟨σx⟩ = (a^* b + b^* a) as I did earlier. Since a and b are real, this is 2ab.

So a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866. So yes, that's correct.

So now, putting it all together: the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Compute each part: 10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈ 4.33.

So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me compute exactly. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866025. 5 times that is 4.330125.

So 10σz gives 10*(−0.5) = −5.

Adding 5σx gives −5 +4.330125 = −0.669875. Rounding to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7. So looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the σx part.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩: the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩. The expectation value of σx is (a^2 -b^2) * 2? Because the expectation is (|a|^2 - |b|^2) * 2. Let's test that: a is 0.5, so a²=0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so b²=3/4=0.75. So 0.25−0.75=−0.5. Multiply by 2: -1. So that would give ⟨σx⟩ = -1. But that contradicts what I had earlier.

Wait, that can't be. I must have messed something up. Because earlier I thought it was 0.866. Now this approach suggests it's -1. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I mixed up something. Let me re-express the state.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me represent this as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The Pauli X matrix (σx) is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is ψ† (σx ψ) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Compute the dot product: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + same term = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 0.5 * sqrt(3). So that's sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous method where I thought it was (a^2 -b^2)*2. Because a²=0.25, b²=0.75, a²−b²= -0.5. Multiply by 2 gives -1. But according to the matrix method, it's approximately 0.866.

So where's the mistake? Oh, maybe the formula I thought about is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is (a*b + a*b) when the state is a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩. Because in the σx expectation value, it's 2ab, as I found earlier.

Wait no, no, wait. When I did the matrix multiplication, I got sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So that's correct. So the formula I used earlier when I thought it was (a² - b²)*2 must be wrong. So where did I get that idea? Maybe I confused it with something else.

Wait, the expectation of σz is (a² - b²), right? Because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ = a²(1) + b²(−1) = a² − b². Which in this case is 0.25−0.75 = −0.5. Correct.

But for σx, it's different. Let me think: the matrix of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation is ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute it again.

ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then ψ† σx ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So that's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, so that's correct. So the formula for ⟨σx⟩ is 2ab, but wait, a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2ab= 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (1)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2. So yes, that's correct. So earlier, I think I confused the formula for ⟨σx⟩ with something else. So the correct value is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So putting this back into the problem:

⟨10σz +5σx⟩ =10*(−0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

10*(−0.5)=−5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2)= (5*1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈4.330125.

Adding them: −5 +4.330125 = −0.669875.

Which is approximately −0.67. But the question says up to one decimal place, so that would be -0.7.

Looking back at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, did I compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) correctly?

Yes, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205.

5 * 1.73205 =8.66025.

Divide by 2: 4.330125.

So 10σz is 10*(-0.5)=−5.

Add to 4.330125: −5 +4.330125 =−0.669875. Rounded to one decimal place is −0.7. So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of an operator is given by \( \langle \psi | \hat{O} | \psi \rangle \), and we can compute it as the sum of the expectation values of each term in the operator.

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. For the given state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = 0.75 \):

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is given by:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the state \( \psi = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab.
\]

Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Rounding to one decimal place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
