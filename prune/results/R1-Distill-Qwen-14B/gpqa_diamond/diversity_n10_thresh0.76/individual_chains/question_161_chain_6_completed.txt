Alright, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopy and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, okay, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the scenario is Mike is designing a high-resolution TEM that's operating at a pretty high voltage—1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because, I guess, having gas around would interfere with the electron beam. Like, if there's gas there, electrons might scatter off the gas molecules, which would reduce image quality or resolution.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still there because the mass spectrometer detected them. So he calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path isn't λ1 anymore; it's λ2. But the temperature in the compartment is the same, so temperature isn't changing. So what's causing this change?

Wait, the mean free path for gas molecules is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density of the gas and d is the collision diameter. Alternatively, I remember another formula involving pressure, temperature, and molar mass: λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² n), but n is related to pressure via the ideal gas law, n = P/(k_B T M), where M is molar mass. Wait, maybe I should think about how mean free path depends on pressure and other factors.

Wait, more accurately, the mean free path λ is proportional to 1/(P√M), where M is the molecular weight. But maybe another way: the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and directly proportional to temperature. Because higher pressure means more molecules, so shorter mean free path.

But wait, when Mike starts the electron beam, the pressure is still the same, right? Because the pumps are running and the setup is supposed to keep the vacuum. But wait, the electron beam might affect things. Oh! Because when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause various effects. One thing I remember is that high-energy electrons can ionize the gas molecules. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules might become charged. But wait, charged particles in a vacuum would behave differently. Oh, but how does this affect the mean free path?

Wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum... would they move more freely because they can be accelerated by the electric fields, or would they stick together more? Hmm, but wait, in the electron microscope, the vacuum is so good that any ions would have a hard time moving. Alternatively, the ions could be attracted to the sample or other parts of the column, but that's more about contamination rather than free path.

Wait, but the main point is about electron scattering. If the gas is neutral, the electrons can scatter off the gas atoms. But if the gas is ionized, maybe the electrons don't interact the same way. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be ionized, which affects their behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be heated or to move more. Because the electrons are high-energy, they can transfer energy to the gas molecules via collisions. But wait, the temperature of the compartment is the same, so thermal energy shouldn't change. But maybe the way the gas is ionized affects the mean free path.

Wait another angle: The mean free path is a measure of how far a molecule travels before colliding with another. If the gas is now ionized, but the ionization doesn't change the number density (so pressure stays the same), then the mean free path λ should remain λ1. But Mike's observation is that it's now λ2, different from λ1. So what's causing this?

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it causes the gas molecules to be excited, maybe increasing their velocity. If the molecules are moving faster, their mean free path would be longer because collisions happen less frequently—because the time between collisions is longer. But wait, the mean free path depends on the average speed. So if the speed increases, the mean free path increases.

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (v_avg) * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If the velocity increases, either because temperature increases (which it isn't, since temperature is same) or because of some other effect, then λ increases. But in the scenario, the temperature is the same, so thermal velocity is same. So that can't be it.

Wait, but ionized gas particles might have different behavior. If the gas is ionized, the molecules are now charged. So when they collide, perhaps the cross-section for collisions changes. The collision diameter d is a measure of the effective size for collisions. If the molecules are ionized, maybe they have a larger effective size because they have electron clouds or something. Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, perhaps the interaction between ions and electrons leads to different collision dynamics.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors, like electron scattering from the gas. So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may act as targets for the electrons. So the electrons are scattering off the gas atoms, and this might influence the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Or perhaps the mean free path being measured is that of the electrons, not the gas molecules? Wait, the question says Mike observed the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas. Oh, so perhaps he's measuring how much the electron beam is scattered by the gas, which would depend on the electron mean free path in the gas.

Wait, that's a good point. The mean free path for the electrons as they pass through the gas would be different than that of the gas molecules. Because electrons have a different way of interacting—it's Coulomb scattering, perhaps.

So, the gas molecules have a certain mean free path λ1 based on their collisions with each other. But when Mike turns on the electron beam, he's concerned about the electron's mean free path through the gas, which would be λ2.

So the question is: How does the electron mean free path compare to the gas molecule mean free path?

Hmm, so the mean free path for electrons is λ_e = 1/(n σ_e), where σ_e is the cross-section for electron scattering. The gas molecule's mean free path is λ_g = 1/(n σ_g), where σ_g is the cross-section for gas molecule collisions.

If the electron scattering cross-section σ_e is much larger than σ_g, then λ_e would be much smaller than λ_g. But wait, in reality, for gases at ultra-high vacuum, the electron mean free path is usually longer than that of the gas molecules because the electron-gas interaction is weaker. But wait, when you have a gas, the electrons can scatter off the gas atoms. But in a good vacuum, the electron mean free path is quite long.

Wait, but in this scenario, the gas is present, so the electron beam would have a shorter mean free path because of scattering. But Mike found that the mean free path changed to λ2. So how does λ2 compare to λ1?

Wait, the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1) is determined by their mutual collisions. The mean free path for the electrons (λ2) is determined by their scattering off the gas. So these are two different quantities. But the question says that when Mike initiated the electron beam, he noticed the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So I think in this context, λ2 refers to the electron's mean free path, not the gas's. Because the gas's mean free path depends on their own collisions, which hasn't changed (same pressure, same temp, same volume), so λ1 should stay the same.

Wait, but that's conflicting. The question says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2. So perhaps the mean free path being discussed is that of the gas molecules, but why would that change? Because electron beam is on.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be heated or ionized, affecting their mean free path. But the question states that the temperature remains the same, so thermal effects are likely not the cause. Unless the ionization state changes the effective cross-section.

So, for gas molecules, the mean free path λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² n). If the pressure is the same (n same), and T same, then λ should be same. But maybe ionization affects the effective d. If the gas is ionized, the molecules might have a larger effective diameter, because ions have higher charge and perhaps a larger electron cloud, so d increases. If d increases, then λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1. But wait, the scenario says the mean free path is now λ2, which is different from λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile, or perhaps the mean free path is measured differently. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another angle: the presence of the electron beam introduces a significant amount of energy, which can cause electron scattering off the gas. So the electrons' mean free path would be shorter because they're more likely to scatter. But the question is about the mean free path Mike observed. If Mike is measuring the electron's mean free path, then λ2 would be less than λ1, because electrons are more likely to scatter off the gas molecules. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because the gas's mean free path (λ1) is about their mutual collisions, not about electron scattering. So perhaps the question is mixing up the two.

Wait, the question says: Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (λ1). Then, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2. So he's measuring the same thing as before (gas molecules' mean free path), but it's changed. So why would the mean free path of the gas molecules change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, that's confusing. Because the gas's mean free path depends on their own properties and the environment. If the temperature is the same, and pressure is the same, then λ1 should remain the same. So why is it now λ2?

Unless the electron beam somehow affects the gas. Like, perhaps the beam causes the gas to ionize, which changes the effective diameter d. For example, when a gas is ionized, the ions have a larger effective diameter due to their charge. So if the gas was previously neutral (λ1), now it's ionized (λ2), so d increases, hence λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think about the effect of ionization on the collision diameter. When gas molecules are ionized, they have a larger effective size because the ions have expanded electron clouds. So yes, d increases, leading to a smaller λ. Therefore, λ2 would be less than λ1. So the answer would be C.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike aimed to achieve an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecules interfering with the electron beam. Despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles remained, and Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state as $\lambda_1$. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path $\lambda$ for gas molecules is given by $\lambda = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}$, where $d$ is the collision diameter, $n$ is the number density, and $T$ is the temperature. Since the temperature is constant, any change in $\lambda$ must arise from changes in $d$ or $n$. The pressure in the compartment is also constant, so $n$ remains unchanged. Therefore, the change in $\lambda$ must be due to a change in $d$.

When the electron beam is turned on, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective size of the gas molecules due to their expanded electron clouds, leading to a larger collision diameter $d$. Since $\lambda$ is inversely proportional to $d^2$, an increase in $d$ results in a decrease in $\lambda$. Thus, $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$.

This conclusion aligns with the observation that the mean free path changes when the electron beam is initiated, as the ionization of gas molecules alters their effective size and, consequently, their mean free path.
