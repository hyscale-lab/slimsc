Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations as they come into and out of view, which could mimic the effect of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The task is to find out what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star scenario. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the brightness variation in photometric data (like a light curve) is due to the change in the amount of light we receive when a planet transits in front of the star. The formula for the transit depth (the dip in brightness) is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the amplitude of the dip is proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii.

But wait, in this problem, the variation isn't caused by a planet but by star spots. So the star's brightness changes because different parts of its surface (with and without spots) rotate into and out of view. Let me think about how this works.

When a star has spots, the total brightness we observe depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. Since the spots are cooler, the star's overall brightness will dip when a spot is facing us. The total brightness variation would depend on the size and temperature of the spots compared to the rest of the star.

The problem mentions that the star's hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So, the entire hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². So, the area of the spots is 0.2 times 2πR², which is 0.4πR².

But wait, each spot is a certain area, but the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Or wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered. Oh, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire star's surface is 4πR², and the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, no, a hemisphere is half the surface, so 2πR². So the spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total
