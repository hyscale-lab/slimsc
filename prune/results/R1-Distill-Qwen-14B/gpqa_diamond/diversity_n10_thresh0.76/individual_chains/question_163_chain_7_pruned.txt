Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, they usually neutralize each other, producing water and a salt. 

So, the problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I should calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. 

We have 0.1 grams, so moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.0009358 moles. Let me check: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Yeah, that's approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, for example, it should form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Wait, right, because each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so each would react with H+.

So the mole ratio is 1:3 for Fe(OH)3 to H+. That means for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

We have 0.0009358 moles of Fe(OH)3. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles / concentration. Volume (L) = 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 liters, which is 28.074 cm³. That's about 28.07 cm³. But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me check the options: option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. So the minimum volume needed is approximately 28.07 cm³.

But wait, what about the total volume? The initial solution is 100 cm³. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so adding the acid will change the volume slightly. But since the acid volume is about 28 cm³, the total becomes 128 cm³, but wait, no, the question says that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the acid is added to the solution, making the total volume 100 cm³. Hmm, I might have to account for that.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem says that the solution prepared after adding the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So
