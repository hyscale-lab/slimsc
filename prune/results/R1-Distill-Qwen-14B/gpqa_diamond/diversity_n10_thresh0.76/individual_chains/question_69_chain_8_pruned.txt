Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. Hmm, let me think through what I remember from my studies. The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, I remember that the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. When the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime τ is τ = γτ₀. Oh wait, right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light.

Gamma is given by gamma = E/mc². Oh wait, because E is the total energy of the particle, and when you have relativistic particles, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, E is the total energy, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. So gamma would be E/(m c²), but wait, let's check the units. Since E is given in GeV and m is also in GeV, maybe the c² cancels out somehow. Hmm, perhaps in these units, E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, let me think in terms of units. Let me get back to the formula.

Calculating gamma: gamma = E / (m c²). But since E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², perhaps the units work out. Let me see, m c² would be GeV, so E = gamma * m c². Therefore, gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, let's get the numbers. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3.41. 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is about 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8. Let me calculate it exactly: 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

So gamma is approximately 7.918. Now, the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the bubble chamber frame) is longer by a factor of gamma. So the observed lifetime τ = gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that: 7.918 * 8 ≈ 63.344. So tau ≈ 63.344e-16 seconds, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, but the problem is about the resolution needed. The resolution relates to the distance the particle travels before decaying. Because in the lab, the particle is moving, and the longer it lives, the further it goes. The distance L is c multiplied by the lifetime τ, the observed lifetime.

So L = c * tau. Let me plug in the numbers. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s. Let me compute that: 3e8 * 6.3344e-15 = (3 * 6.3344) * 1e-7. 3 *6 is 18, 0.3344*3 is ~1.00
