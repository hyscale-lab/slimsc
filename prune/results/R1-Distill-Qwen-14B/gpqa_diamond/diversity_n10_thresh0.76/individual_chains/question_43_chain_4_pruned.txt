Okay, so I've got this complex organic chemistry problem here. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC naming, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, that means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon (meta position). Let me visualize that. If I number the ring, let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the cyano and the aldehyde would be at positions 3 and 5 respectively, or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, meta is three positions apart, so if 1 is the acid, then 3 and 5 are meta to each other and also meta to 1? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each position is numbered in a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Let's think about how the substituents are arranged. The carboxylic acid is one substituent. Another is the carbaldehyde, which is an aldehyde group attached to the ring. The third is a cyano group (CN).

So, all three are meta to each other. That probably means each is in a position three away from the others. So, for example, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the aldehyde might be at 3, and
