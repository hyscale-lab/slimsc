Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And the question is asking how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis, but it can also do other types like ring-opening or cross metathesis.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's the structure of that? Let's draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's count the carbons.

Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is double bond starting at C1. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methyl. So numbering from the double bond: 1 and 2 are the double bond carbons. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Alternatively, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene: Carbon chain is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait, maybe another approach. Let me write the structure.

Pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the third carbon (from the double bond end) is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No wait, wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is:

1       2       3       4       5
