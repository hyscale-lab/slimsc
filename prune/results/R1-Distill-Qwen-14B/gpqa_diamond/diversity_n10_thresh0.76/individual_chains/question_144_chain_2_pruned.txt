Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about a meson resonance, X. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, right? They don't exist for long because they decay quickly. But the question is about the mean decay distance. Hmm, I think that's the average distance the particle travels before it decays.

The given data is the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, which are very small. So I'm thinking this has to do with the particle's lifetime and how fast it's moving. Because the mean decay distance is probably the product of the particle's velocity and its lifetime.

Wait, right, the formula for mean decay distance (L) is L = v * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime. But tau is related to the particle's width. I think the width Γ is connected to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I might need to think about the exact relation.

Oh wait, for a resonance, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the decay width, which is the energy uncertainty in the resonance's mass, so the product of Γ and τ should be around ħ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the units here. ħ has units of J·s, right? And Gamma is in MeV. I need to convert everything into compatible units. 

First, let me calculate the lifetime τ. Then, find the speed v of the meson. Once I have both, multiply them to get the decay distance L.

So, steps:

1. Calculate τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson based on its energy and mass.
3. Compute L = v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find v? The meson has a certain energy, and from that, we can find its momentum and then velocity.

I remember that E²
