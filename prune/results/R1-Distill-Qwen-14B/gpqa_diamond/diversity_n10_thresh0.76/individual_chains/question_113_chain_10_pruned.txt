Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The problem says there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. So that makes me think the compound has either an alcohol (-OH), carboxylic acid, or maybe an ether. But wait, ethers don't have O-H groups, so probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid. 

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C). Wait, but if the compound has an O-H group, let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the O-H would be broad. Alternatively, an ester or ketone might have a carbonyl around 1700. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have at least a double bond, probably in an alkene group.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what could fragment to give m/z 45. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (43?), but wait, 45. Alternatively, maybe something like (CH2)2O or another small group. Maybe it's a fragment from an ester or an acid. Let's think, 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH2)2O (which is 44) but that doesn't add up. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of HCOOCH3? No, wait, that's 60. Hmm, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Or perhaps it's a cleavage of an ester group. Another possibility is something like a methyl ester losing a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into a smaller part, like CH3COO- losing something else. Wait, let me think about other possibilities. The molecular weight 45 could be from (CH3)2CO+ (acetone is 58, so that's not it). Oh, wait, another possibility: the fragment is C3H7O+? But wait, 45 is C2H5O2? No, I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the possible formulas. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.
