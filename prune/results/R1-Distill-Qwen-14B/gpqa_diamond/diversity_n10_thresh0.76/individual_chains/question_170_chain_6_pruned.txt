Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step. 

First, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation represents a two-component vector, like a column vector. So the state vector would be χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors for spin-½ particles like electrons.

The question is asking about the expectation value of S_y. Oh, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket product: <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. 

But wait, what's the matrix form of S_y? I think the Pauli matrices are involved here. Oh right, the spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. And the σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me write that down:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. 

Now, the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. To compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Let's break this down. 

First, compute S_y |χ⟩. Then take the inner product of χ with that result.

Let me write out S_y |χ⟩ as a matrix multiplication. So,

S_y |χ⟩ = (ħ/2) * σ_y * [3i; 4]

Breaking down the matrix multiplication:

σ_y multiplied by the vector [3i;4]:

The first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i². Since i² is -1, 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * [3i;4] gives the vector [-4i; -3]. 

Then multiply by (ħ/2), so S_y |χ⟩ becomes (ħ/2
