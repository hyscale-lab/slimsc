Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I guess I need to normalize this state because it's proportional, but not necessarily normalized yet.

The operator whose matrix representation is A_ij. The elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and zero otherwise. Oh wait, so that's an interesting matrix. Let me visualize it. It's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. So, for a two-level system, the matrix would look like this:
[0   (hbar/2)]
[(hbar/2)   0]
Because for i≠j, it's hbar/2, and the diagonal is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the matrix A_ij has A_ij = hbar/2 when i ≠ j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix is:
[0      hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0]

Wait, but wait. The standard Pauli matrices are different. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s in the off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal.

So the operator is A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

The task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator, and also find the average (expected) value of the operator.

Wait, but the question says, "the eigenstates of the operator" — so the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, the observable is A, so when we measure A, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

Hmm. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, and sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so ± hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, sigma_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So if A = (hbar/2) sigma_x, then the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ± hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A as well, because they're the same operator up to a scalar factor.

What are the eigenstates of sigma_x? They are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since the operator A is diagonal in the |+x> and |-x> basis, the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in those states.

So first, let me write |alpha> as a normalized state.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is proportional to that, so the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / N, where N is the normalization factor. N is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Compute the magnitude squared of each coefficient:

Coefficient of |up> is (1+i
