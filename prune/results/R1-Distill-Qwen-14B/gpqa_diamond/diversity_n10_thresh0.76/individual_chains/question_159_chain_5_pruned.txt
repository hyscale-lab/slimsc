Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. Then, at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember that quasars can have emission lines, and the peak here might relate to some kind of emission feature. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm, but that's in the UV. But wait, if the quasar is at high redshift, that line could be redshifted into the optical or near-infrared.

So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's the redshifted Lyman-alpha line. Let me calculate the redshift. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So, observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm. Redshift z is (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So z ≈ 5.5. Wait, wait, 121.6 * (1 + z) = 790. So (790 / 121.6) = about 6.499, so z ≈ 5.499. So z ≈5.5.

But wait, another possibility: could this peak be from the Balmer break or something else? The Balmer break in quasars is a drop in flux at about 400 nm (the Lyman limit), but here the drop is at 790, which is longer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Lyman limit after redshifting. Wait, no, the Lyman limit is 91.2 nm rest frame. If it's shifted to 790, that's a z of (790/91.2) -1. 790/91.2 is about 8.66, so z≈7.66. That would be a higher redshift.

Wait, but the question says the flux drops below 790 nm. So if the peak
