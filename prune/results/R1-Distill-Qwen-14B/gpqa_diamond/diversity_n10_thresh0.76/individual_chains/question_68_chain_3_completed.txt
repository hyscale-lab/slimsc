Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the particle has a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Right, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to spin S by a gyromagnetic ratio gamma, so mu = gamma S. And Sz is the spin operator along the z-axis.

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Oh, right, when a magnetic field is applied, the spin will align with it because that's the lowest energy state. So the particle's magnetic moment is along +Z. Now, suddenly the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. So the magnetic field switches from B in Z to B in Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. Oh, when the magnetic field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. I remember that in such cases, the spin state will evolve over time, causing the expectation values of the spin components (like <Sz>) to oscillate.

Wait, but how does the spin precess when the magnetic field changes? I think when the field is applied along a different axis, the Hamiltonian changes, and the system undergoes time evolution under a new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian (along Z), but not of the new one (along Y). So the state will evolve with time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The initial state must be the eigenstate of S_z. Since it's a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is aligned with the initial magnetic field.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Wait, mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of B. Here, n is along +Y, so H = -gamma B (S_y). But S_y for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but in terms of the Hamiltonian's matrix, I should think about how it acts on the spin states.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is the frequency of precession of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field. The formula I remember is omega = gamma * B. But wait, that's for a magnetic field along a certain axis. So when the field is along Y, the precession will be about Y. But how does that affect the components in Z?

Wait, the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component. So the expectation value <Sz> will change over time. Let me think about how that happens.

In the new situation, the particle is in a state that was an eigenstate of S_z but now is in a state with a different Hamiltonian. The time evolution is determined by the new H. So the time-dependent state is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so H = gamma B S_y (Wait, wait. Let me get the signs right. The energy of a magnetic moment in a field is U = -mu · B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

But S_y is an operator. So the Hamiltonian in terms of eigenvalues would involve the eigenstates of S_y. Let me write down the matrix representation of S_y for spin-1/2. The Pauli matrices have S_x proportional to sigma_x, S_y to sigma_y, etc. Remember, S = (ħ/2) sigma. So S_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y, so H = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - (gamma B ħ/2) (sigma_y).

Alternatively, H could be written as H = (gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y with a negative sign, because of the negative in the Hamiltonian expression. Wait, no: H = -mu · B, and mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma S · B. Since B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y, and S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = -(gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the energy eigenvalues for H would be proportional to ± (gamma B ħ/2). But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the signs. Let me think: H is proportional to sigma_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when acting on the states, it's going to cause transitions between |+z> and |-z>.

The initial state is |+z> = [1; 0], I think. So the time evolution will involve terms oscillating in time due to the exponential of the Hamiltonian.

Wait, I should probably write the time evolution operator. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>.

Let me calculate H. H is proportional to sigma_y. Let me compute H as H = -gamma B S_y = -(gamma B ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H = ( - gamma B ħ/2 ) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Let me write this as H = (gamma B ħ/2) [[0, i], [-i, 0]] because I pulled a negative into the matrix. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me compute H more accurately.

H = -gamma B S_y.

S_y = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So H = -gamma B * (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

H = (- gamma B ħ/2 ) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Alternatively, H can be seen as proportional to the Pauli Y matrix with a negative coefficient.

Now, the time evolution operator is U = exp( -i H t / ħ )

So H has the form a * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] where a = (- gamma B ħ/2 )

So H = a * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Let me denote H as a * sigma_y, where a is negative.

Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so H = a sigma_y, with a = (- gamma B ħ/2 )

So U = exp( -i (a sigma_y) t / ħ )

= exp( -i a t sigma_y / ħ )

Hmm, because sigma_y squared is identity matrix, since sigma_y^2 = I. So for any theta, exp( i theta sigma_y ) = I cos(theta) + i sigma_y sin(theta) 

Wait, but in our case, the exponent is (-i a t sigma_y / ħ ), so let me write that as ( -i (a/ħ) t ) sigma_y. Let me denote theta = (a t )/(ħ) )

Wait, no, because a is ( - gamma B ħ / 2 ). So (a t ) / ħ = (- gamma B t / 2 )

So theta = ( - gamma B t / 2 )

So U = exp( -i theta sigma_y )

Using the identity exp(i phi sigma_y) = I cos(phi) + i sigma_y sin(phi), but here the exponent is -i theta sigma_y. So:

exp( -i theta sigma_y ) = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta )

Because:

exp(i phi sigma) = I cos(phi) + i sigma sin(phi)

So if I have exp( -i theta sigma ), it's the same as exp(i (-theta) sigma ), so it's I cos(theta) - i sigma sin(theta).

So U = cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta )

Now, the initial state |+z> is [1; 0]. So let me compute U |+z>:

U |+z> = [ cos(theta) I - i sigma_y sin(theta) ] [1; 0 ]

Let me compute each part:

I [1;0] = [1;0]

sigma_y [1;0] = [[0, -i],[i,0]] [1;0] = [0*1 + (-i)*0, ... ] Wait, no. Let's compute sigma_y * [1;0].

sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So sigma_y * [1;0] = [0*1 + (-i)*0; i*1 + 0*0 ]? Wait, no. Matrix multiplication: rows of sigma_y times columns of [1;0].

First element: (0)(1) + (-i)(0) = 0
Second element: (i)(1) + (0)(0) = i

So sigma_y |+z> = [0; i]

So now, putting it back into U |+z>:

= cos(theta) * [1;0] - i sin(theta) * [0; i ]

= [ cos(theta); 0 ] - i sin(theta) [0; i ]

Wait, the second term is -i sin(theta) multiplied by [0; i], which is [0; i] multiplied by (-i sin(theta)).

So:

First component: cos(theta) + 0 = cos(theta)
Second component: 0 + (-i * i ) sin(theta) 

But (-i * i ) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So the second component is 1 * sin(theta )

So overall:

U |+z> = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T

Wait, that's a neat result. So the state at time t is |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T, where theta is (- gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, but theta is negative. So cos(theta) and sin(theta) would have their usual forms but with a negative argument.

But let me think about the expectation value of S_z. The expectation value <Sz> is the expectation of the operator S_z in the state |psi(t)>.

S_z is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So <Sz> is (ħ/2) times [ <psi(t)| [1 0; 0 -1] |psi(t) ].

Compute this:

|psi(t)> = [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T

So <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = (ħ/2) [ cos(theta) , sin(theta) ] [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T

Let me compute the matrix multiplication:

First, the matrix multiplication [1 0; 0 -1] [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ]^T would give:

[ (1 * cos(theta) + 0 * sin(theta) ), (0 * cos(theta) + (-1)* sin(theta)) ) ]^T? No, wait, the matrix is diagonal, so it just scales each component. So when you multiply S_z with |psi(t)>, you get [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Then, taking the inner product with <psi(t)|:

= cos(theta) * cos(theta) + sin(theta) * (- sin(theta) )

= cos²(theta) - sin²(theta) = cos(2 theta)

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 theta )

But theta is (- gamma B t / 2 )

So cos(2 theta ) = cos( - gamma B t )

Because 2 theta is 2 * (-gamma B t / 2 ) = - gamma B t.

And cos is even, so cos(-x) = cos(x). So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument. So the frequency omega is gamma B.

But wait, the options don't have ħ in them, but the question probably assumes that gamma already accounts for ħ. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: The Hamiltonian's energy is H = -gamma B S_y. The time evolution is governed by H, so the energy levels determine the frequencies. The energy difference between the two eigenstates would give rise to the frequency. The energy levels are E_+ and E_-.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field along Y, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the energies are E = -gamma B (S_y eigenvalue ), which is E = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E = gamma B (ħ/2 ), because S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix.

Wait, let me calculate:

H = -gamma B S_y.

So eigenvalues are H_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 ) and H_- = gamma B ( ħ/2 )

The energy difference between the two states is H_+ - H_- = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) - (gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = -gamma B ħ.

But the frequency would be (E_+ - E_- )/( ħ )

Wait, the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (-gamma B ħ ) / ħ = -gamma B.

The magnitude is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but in the expectation value of Sz, we had <Sz> proportional to cos(gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait, let me recheck the earlier calculation.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, the expectation value was (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ), which would imply a frequency of gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial state is |+z>. So when the field is applied along Y, the state is a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states. Because |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution would cause the phase difference between the components, leading to oscillations in <Sz>. The frequency of the oscillation comes from the energy difference between the states.

The energy difference is (E_+ - E_- ) = (gamma B ħ/2 ) - (-gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the frequency omega is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the correct answer is B) gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+Y$ direction, the particle's spin precesses around the new field direction, causing the expectation value of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle S_z \rangle$, to oscillate. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency.

The Hamiltonian for the system in the new magnetic field along $+Y$ is $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. For a spin-1/2 particle, $S_y$ is proportional to the Pauli $Y$ matrix, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The energy eigenvalues of the system are therefore $E_+ = -\gamma B (\hbar/2)$ and $E_- = \gamma B (\hbar/2)$. The energy difference between the two states is:

\[
\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = -\gamma B \hbar.
\]

The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference divided by $\hbar$:

\[
\omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
\]

To confirm this, the time evolution of the initial state $|+z\rangle$ under the new Hamiltonian is analyzed. The state evolves as $|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iHt/\hbar}|+z\rangle$, and the expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ is computed. The result shows that $\langle S_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, confirming that the oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
