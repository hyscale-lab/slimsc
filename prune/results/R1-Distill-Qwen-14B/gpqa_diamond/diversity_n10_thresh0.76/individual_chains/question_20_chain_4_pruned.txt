Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics and approximations in many-body calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the "impulse" approximation, where nucleons are treated as if they're free. I remember that this approximation is used when dealing with interactions in a nucleus, like electroweak interactions. The idea is that each nucleon behaves independently, right? So the question is asking which assumptions together lead to this impulse approximation.

The four assumptions given are 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me go through each one.

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That makes sense. If the interaction is with individual nucleons, you can treat them separately, like they're free. So this probably is part of the approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparent... Oh, maybe it's saying that the other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So, when a nucleon interacts, the rest of the nucleus doesn't influence it much. That would imply that the nucleon feels like it's in a vacuum, hence acting freely. So this would be another assumption needed for the impulse approximation.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Non-relativistic quarks would mean they're moving at speeds much less than light. But how does that affect the approximation? Well, in non-relativistic cases, you can treat particles as point-like and use simpler wavefunctions. But wait, the impulse approximation is more about the external interactions, not the internal structure of the nucleon. So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this assumption isn't directly about the interaction with the rest of the nucleus but about how the nucleon itself behaves. If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps they don't contribute much to the binding forces or something? Or maybe this is a red herring and not part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right! So the binding forces between nucleons are ignored. If the nucleon is treated as free, it's as if the binding (like the strong nuclear force between nucleons) doesn't matter during the interaction. That definitely sounds like part of the impulse approximation.

So the question is, which combination of these four assumptions leads to the impulse approximation? Let's think.

Impulse approximation: treat each nucleon as if it's free, so the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction. So for that, the interaction must be considered to only involve a single nucleon (assumption 1), the rest of the nucleus is transparent, meaning they don't affect the interaction (assumption 2), and the nucleon isn't bound (assumption 4). What about assumption 3?

Wait, the impulse approximation probably doesn't make any assumptions about the internal structure of the nucleon. It's more about treating the nucleon as if it's free in the nuclear medium. So assumption 3
