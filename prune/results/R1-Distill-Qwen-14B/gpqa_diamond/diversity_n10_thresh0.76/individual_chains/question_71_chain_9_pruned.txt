Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh yeah, the formula is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²)) )^(1/4), but since albedo is the same for all, I can ignore that part. So the formula simplifies to T being proportional to (1/distance)^(1/2).

But wait, the distance relates to the orbital period through Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So P² ∝ a³. So a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for each planet, their distance a is proportional to P^(2/3). So the equilibrium temperature should be inversely proportional to (a)^(1/2), which is the same as (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = P^(1/3). So T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), and a is proportional to P^(2/3). So substituting, T is proportional to 1/( (P^(2/3) )^(1/2) ) ) = 1/( P^(1/3) ). So T ∝ P^(-1/3). 

So the temperature ratio between two planets would be (T4 / T2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Wait, because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if P4 is larger, T4 is smaller. So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure. Because if planet 2 has a period P2, and planet 4 has P4, then the ratio T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3). Because T is proportional to P^(-1/3), so T4 = k * P4^(-1/3), and T2 = k * P2^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = [P2^(-1/3)] / [P4^(-1/3)] ) = (P4/P2)^(1/3) )^-1 → (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Let's say T is proportional to (1/ a^0.5). And a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a = k * P^(2/3). So 1/a^0.5 = 1/(k^0.5 * P^(1/3)) ). So T is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ), so T = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So T4/T2 = (C / P4^(1/3)) ) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P4^(1/3) ) )= (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for each planet, the periods are:

Planet_1: 1 unit
Planet_2: 2 units
Planet_3: 2.5 units
Planet_4: 3.5 units
Planet_5: 5 units

Wait, but their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So the ratio (P2/P4) is 4/7, so (4/7)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. 

What's 4/7? Approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714. Let's see, 0.5^3 is 0.125, 0.8^3 is 0.5
