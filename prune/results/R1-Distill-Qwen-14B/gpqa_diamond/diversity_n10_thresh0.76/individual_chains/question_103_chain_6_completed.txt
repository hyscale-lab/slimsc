Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's analyze the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethan-1-one group is attached to the benzene, which means it's a ketone on the benzene ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene? Or is it acetyl? Because ethan-1-one is an acetyl group, right? So, the benzene ring has an acetyl group (from the ketone) and the substituents at 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ethan-1-one is connected to the phenyl group. So, the structure is (Phenyl group with substituents) attached to an ethanone (which is a two-carbon chain with a ketone at position 1). So, the ethanone is CH3-CO- attached to the benzene ring. So, the benzene ring has substituents at 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro), and the acetyl group is presumably at position 1 or another position. Wait, but in the name, the substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, so the acetyl must be at position 1? Or is the numbering different because of substituents? Let me clarify.

Wait, the parent is ethan-1-one, so the substituent is at position 1 of the ketone. So, the ketone is on the benzene ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. The molecule is: benzene ring with substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the acetyl group (COCH3) at position 1? Or at another position?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is such that the acetyl group is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. Wait, in benzene, the numbering would be such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, if the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group, that makes sense.

So the benzene ring has acetyl at position 1, and substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). Wait, but in benzene, positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other. Hmm, but in that case, the three substituents would be at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring; perhaps the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, maybe I should think about the synthesis pathway. The starting material is benzene. The target has an acetyl group, a bromo, and a nitro group. So, the steps probably involve introducing these groups in a specific order, considering the directing effects of each substituent.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the substituents direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Nitro groups are meta directors, bromine (as a substituent) is also a meta director, but wait, bromine as a substituent is deactivating and meta-directing. Acetyl groups are meta directors as well, because they are electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, but when you introduce substituents, their directing effects influence where the next group goes. So, the order in which you introduce substituents is crucial.

Wait, let's outline the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: acetyl (COCH3) at one position, bromine at another, and nitro group at the third. The bromine is at position 3, nitro at position 5 relative to the acetyl. So, perhaps the acetyl is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. But benzene is symmetric, so the numbering may vary, but the relative positions are meta (1 and 3) and 5 is para to 1?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents in the order they are introduced.

Let me think: Starting with benzene, perhaps the first substituent is the acetyl group. Because acetylation is typically done via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which uses CH3COCl and AlCl3 as a catalyst. So, the first step would be Friedel-Crafts acylation to add the acetyl group. Benzene is nitrated next, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts, the acyl group is added to benzene. But benzene is activated towards electrophilic substitution. Once the acetyl is added, it's a meta director. So, the next substituent would come in at the meta position relative to the acetyl.

So, if the target has nitro and bromo groups, perhaps these are introduced next. But nitro groups are strong deactivating groups and would affect where the next substituent goes.

Wait, but nitration is done in a specific position based on the directing of existing substituents. Let's say the acetyl is added first. The ring becomes meta-directing. So, if we then nitrate, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. Then, when adding bromine, where would it go?

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors as well, but being deactivating. So, after adding nitro, the ring is more deactivating, but when adding bromine, which is a substituent, perhaps it goes into another position.

Alternatively, maybe the order is: acetylate first, then nitrate, then brominate. Or maybe brominate first, then nitrate, then acetylate. Wait, no, because acetylation is a Friedel-Crafts reaction, which requires the ring to be activated. So, if we introduce deactivating groups first, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, acetylation must come before nitration and bromination, because nitro and bromo are deactivating groups.

So, the steps would be:

1. Acetylate benzene to get acetophenone (phenyl ketone).
2. Then, introduce nitro and bromo groups in the correct positions.

But how?

When you nitrate acetophenone, the nitro group will enter the meta position relative to the acetyl group. Then, when you brominate, where will it go?

Wait, but the target has bromo and nitro in specific positions. Let me think. Suppose after acetylation, the ring is meta-directing. Nitration adds NO2 at the meta position of the acetyl. So, the nitro is at position 3 (assuming the acetyl is at position 1). Then, bromination would occur where?

Wait, but if the ring has an acetyl and a nitro group, then the next substituent (bromine) would be directed by the existing substituents. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, while acetyl is also deactivating and meta-directing. The incoming electrophile would be directed to the position that is meta to either of them. So, perhaps the bromine would go into a position that is meta to both, but that's possible only if the substituents are already in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to do nitration before acetylation, but that can't be because Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, which benzene is. But nitro groups deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So, acetylation must come before nitration.

Wait, but in the target, there are three substituents: acetyl, nitro, and bromo. So, the order of addition matters.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituents and their positions. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. Wait, acetophenone is benzene with a ketone (COCH3) group. So, the substituents on the benzene are Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5 relative to the ketone.

So, the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So, the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5, making a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, that's a symmetric arrangement. So, the substituents are at every other carbon, which is 1,3,5 positions.

So, after acetylation, the next step is nitration. Nitration of acetophenone would introduce nitro group meta to the acetyl. So, acetophenone (position 1 acetyl) would have nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would come next.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 5. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the order is acetylation, nitration, then bromination. But then, where does each substituent go?

Wait, when you have acetophenone, the acetyl is at position 1. Then, nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Then, when you brominate, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. So, the next substituent (Br) would go meta to the nitro group. The nitro is at 3, so meta would be position 6. But wait, that's not matching the target. Alternatively, maybe the bromine adds para to the nitro group, but that's not likely because nitro is meta-directing.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the steps in the options and see if any make sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation) → ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination) → iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration) → iv) Fe/HCl (probably reduction) → v) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration) → vi) NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization) → vii) H3PO2 (maybe something else, but not sure).

Wait, but after acylation in step i, then bromination in step ii. But the acetyl is a meta director, so the bromine would enter meta to acetyl, say position 3. Then, nitration in step iii: where does the nitro group go? The ring now has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So, the incoming nitro group would go meta to either, but which position is available? Let's see. The ring is 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br). So, the nitro group could go into position 5 (meta to Br) or position 5 (meta to acetyl? No, because acetyl is at 1, meta is 3 and 5. Wait, position 5 is meta to acetyl. So, nitration would add at position 5. So, after step iii, we have acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then, step iv: Fe/HCl is probably a reduction step, maybe of a nitro group to amine? But wait, why would you reduce a nitro group if you need to have a nitro in the product? Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Because the target has a nitro group, reducing it would remove it. So, this might not be the right path.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → v) Fe/HCl → vi) NaNO2/HCl → vii) H3PO2.

Wait, starting with bromination. Benzene brominated would give bromobenzene. Then, nitration step would add nitro group. But bromobenzene is a meta director. So, after bromination, nitration would add nitro at meta to Br, say position 3. Then, Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) would add acetyl. But wait, the ring now has Br (position 1) and nitro (position 3). Both are meta directors. So, where would the acetyl go? It would go into a position that is meta to both. But with Br at 1 and nitro at 3, the available positions are 5. So, acetyl would be at position 5. But in the target, the acetyl is at position 1. So, this seems incorrect. Also, Friedel-Crafts cannot be done on deactivated rings. Wait, nitro and bromo groups deactivate the ring. So, Friedel-Crafts acylation would not proceed after nitration and bromination. So, this option might not work. So, this is probably not the correct sequence.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → iv) Br2/FeBr3 → v) HNO3/H2SO4 → vi) NaNO2/HCl → vii) H3PO2.

Wait, starting with nitration. Benzene nitrated gives nitrobenzene. Then, Fe/HCl is probably reducing nitro to amine. So, step ii would give aniline. Then, step iii is Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is a strong activating group (NH2 is ortho/para director). So, acylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine. But after that, step iv is bromination. But wait, the acetyl is an electron-withdrawing group, which is meta-directing. So, when you brominate after acylation, Br would go meta to the acetyl. But then, step v is another nitration. Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So, this might not be the right path.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → ii) Fe/HCl → iii) NaNO2/HCl → iv) H3PO2 → v) Br2/FeBr3 → vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, let's see. Step i: benzene nitrated to nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl probably reduces nitro to amine, making aniline. Step iii: NaNO2/HCl under cold conditions (like diazotization) would convert aniline to a diazonium salt. Then, step iv: H3PO2 is for the Sandmeyer reaction? Wait, H3PO2 is used in the Stannous chloride reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used with Cu to produce something else, maybe a bromide substitution. Wait, the diazonium salt can undergo various reactions. For example, with H2O, it gives phenol; with CuCN, nitrile; with CuCl, chloride; but H3PO2 is used in the Wolf-Kishner reaction, which is for reducing carbonyls, but maybe here it's something else.

Alternatively, step iv could be a reaction where the diazonium salt decomposes, perhaps releasing N2 and substituting the amino group. But I'm not exactly sure what H3PO2 does in this context. Maybe it's a reducing agent?

Wait, regardless, let's think about the substituents. After step ii, we have aniline (NH2 group). Then, step iii is diazotization, which would convert it to a diazonium chloride. Step iv: H3PO2 perhaps decomposes the diazonium salt. For example, in the presence of H3PO2, the diazonium salt might undergo substitution with a bromide. So, perhaps the Br replaces the amino group? Wait, but the target has Br as a substituent, but in the target, the acetyl is another substituent. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe after diazotization, the diazonium salt is treated in a way that bromine is introduced. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitration → nitro group.
2. Reduction → amine.
3. Diazotization → diazonium salt.
4. Possibly substituting with something (like Br?).
5. Then, introduce acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts.
6. Then, another nitration.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So, perhaps this is not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first acetylate, then nitrate, then brominate. But I need to see which option matches this.

Looking back, the correct target has acetyl, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So, the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

So, the order of substituents:

1. Acetyl (position 1)
2. Nitro (position 5, which is meta to acetyl)
3. Br (position 3, which is meta to acetyl and para to nitro)

Wait, but if after acetylation, nitration gives nitro at meta (position 3), and then bromination would be at meta to acetyl (position 5). Wait, this would give Br at 5 and nitro at 3? Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is acetylation, then bromination, then nitration.

Wait, after acetylation (position 1), bromination would add Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Then, nitration would add nitro at position 5, which is meta to Br and also possible to acetyl.

Wait, let's think:

1. Acetyl added → position 1.
2. Bromination (FeBr3) → adds Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl).
3. Nitration → where?

Now, the ring has acetyl (1) and Br (3). Both are meta directors. So, the next substituent (nitro) would enter at the position that is meta to either. The available positions are 5. Because position 2 and 4 are adjacent to Br and acetyl, which are deactivating. So, nitration would occur at position 5.

So, the substituents are at 1,3,5. That matches the target.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acetylate → Friedel-Crafts (CH3COCl/AlCl3)
ii) Brominate → Br2/FeBr3
iii) Nitrate → HNO3/H2SO4

But looking at the options, none of the options have exactly those three steps. Let me check each option.

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromine, nitrate.

So, after step iii, the substituents are acetyl (1), Br (3), nitro (5). Then, steps iv to vii follow. But in the target, we only have these three substituents. But the options go on further. So, perhaps the rest of the steps are unnecessary or perhaps remove some groups.

Wait, but the target has nitro and bromo and acetyl. So, if the steps after iii in the options are not correct, the option might not be right.

Looking at option A: after steps i, ii, iii, we have the substituents correctly placed. But then step iv is Fe/HCl. That's probably a reduction. If you reduce the nitro group, you would lose the nitro substituent, which is not desired. So, option A can't be correct because it would remove the nitro group.

Option B: Steps i is Br, then nitrate, then acylation. But Friedel-Crafts can't be done after nitration and bromination because the ring is deactivated. So, this is not possible. So, B is out.

Option C: Steps i is nitrate, then reduce, then acylation. But after nitration, reducing the nitro to amine gives aniline, which is activating. Then acylation would add the acetyl in ortho or para to the amine. Then, bromination would add where? But the target has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, perhaps this isn't the right order.

Option D: Steps i to iv are nitrate, reduce, diazotize, H3PO2. So, perhaps they're substituting the amino group with something. Then, step v adds Br, step vi adds acetyl, step vii adds nitro again. But the target already has nitro, so adding it again would complicate things. So, maybe D is not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

After acetylation, bromination, and nitration, we would have the desired substituents. So, the correct option should have these three steps in order.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So, that matches the correct steps. But then, steps iv onwards are other reactions which might not be necessary, but the target is achieved only after step iii. So, why are there more steps?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the high-yield synthesis, which requires certain directing groups to be present to ensure that the next substitution occurs correctly.

Wait, considering the order of substitution, after acetylation, nitration is done before bromination could be necessary because nitro is a stronger deactivator than bromine. Wait, but I thought nitration after bromination would not be possible because of the deactivation.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, but in option A, acylation is first, then bromination, then nitration. So, after acylation, bromination adds at position 3, then nitration adds at position 5. So, we end up with 1,3,5-substituted, which is the target. Then, the subsequent steps in option A are not needed, which suggests that option A is incorrect because it includes steps that would alter the desired substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the steps beyond the necessary ones. The question asks for the sequence of reactions, so perhaps the correct option includes all the required steps, including any necessary reductions or other functional group transformations.

Wait, but the target molecule doesn't have any amino groups. So, if any steps involve reduction of nitro groups, that would change the substituents. So, any option that includes a reduction step (like Fe/HCl) after nitration would lead to the loss of the nitro group, which is not desired.

Wait, in option A, after step iii (nitration), step iv is Fe/HCl. Fe and HCl is a reducing environment. So, it would reduce the nitro group to an amine. But the target has a nitro group, so this would be incorrect. Therefore, option A can't be correct.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the synthesis.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we need to perform the nitration after the bromination. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. So, if we introduce bromine first, which is a deactivating group, Friedel-Crafts would not proceed. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, then nitration, then bromination. But then, how does that fit into the options?

Looking again, option B's steps are bromination first, then nitration, then acetylation. But that can't work because Friedel-Crafts can't be done after deactivating groups.

So, only option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. But this leads to the nitro group being added after bromination. However, after step iii in option A, we have the desired substituents, but then steps iv to vii are something else. So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the rest of the steps are not needed. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that some steps are used for activating the ring again or for introducing substituents in a different way.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the nitration isn't the third step. Maybe the nitration is done before bromination. Let me think: if after acetylation, the ring is activated, so nitration would add nitro group. Then, bromination would add Br. But in that case, where would the Br go?

After acetyl (position 1), nitro (position 3), then bromination would go meta to the nitro group, which is position 6. But the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5. So, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option A: After acetylation (step i), bromination (step ii) at meta (position 3). Then, nitration (step iii) at position 5. Then, step iv is Fe/HCl, which would reduce the nitro group to amine. That would ruin the nitro substituent, so option A is incorrect.

Option B: Starts with bromination, then nitration, then acetylation. But Friedel-Crafts can't proceed after nitration and bromination because the ring is deactivated. So, this won't work.

Option C: Nitration, reduction, acetylation, bromination, then nitration again, which would add another nitro group, but the target only has one. So, this is incorrect.

Option D: Nitrate first, reduce to amine, diazotize, H3PO2. Then, brominate, acetylate, nitrate again. But that would add another nitro group, which is not needed, and the steps don't seem to align with the required substituents.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the possibility of using a directing group that allows the substituents to be added in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetylation first, then nitration, then bromination. So, steps i: acetylate; ii: nitrate; iii: brominate. But looking at the options, none of them have this exact sequence. Because in option A, the sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. So, in option A, nitration is after bromination.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration is done after bromination, but in that case, the ring is more deactivated, making nitration difficult. But perhaps if the nitration is done under strongly acidic conditions, it can proceed.

Wait, but if the ring has acetyl (activating?) No, acetyl is deactivating. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acetyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ring less reactive. So, after acetylation, the ring is less reactive than benzene but still more reactive than rings with nitro groups.

So, after acetylation, nitration would be possible, but after nitration, the ring is more deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible, but in this case, the acylation is already done.

So, the correct order is acylate, nitrate, brominate. But looking at the options, none of the options have this exact sequence.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitration is done in a position that is controlled by the acetyl group, and the bromination is done in a position that is controlled by both the acetyl and the nitro groups.

Wait, but the only option that starts with acylation is option A and option C starts with nitration. So, perhaps the correct option is A, but the subsequent steps are something else.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option A:

i) Acetylate → acetyl at position 1.
ii) Brominate → Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl).
iii) Nitrate → nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl, which is now possible because acetyl is the main substituent).

After these three steps, the target is achieved. But option A has more steps, which perhaps are unnecessary. So, why are there more steps?

Perhaps the question includes steps that are not required but are part of a high-yield synthesis. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is about high-yield synthesis. So, maybe the steps after the third are not about adding substituents but about protecting groups or other functional group transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are not relevant to the product. But in any case, the correct substituents are added in the first three steps. So, perhaps option A is the correct one, but the later steps don't affect the substituents.

Wait, but then why would the steps iv to vii be present? Because in the target, we don't have any other substituents. So, perhaps these steps are used to do something else, but the target is achieved before that.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are not part of the correct pathway, but the options include them as distractors.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in considering the directing effects.

Wait, another angle: the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Once the nitro group is present, any subsequent substitution is directed by the nitro group. So, after nitration, bromination would occur meta to nitro, not acetyl.

In option A, after step iii, the nitro is at position 5. Then, step iv: Fe/HCl (probably reduces nitro to amine). But that would change the substituent, which is not desired. So, this would make option A incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong and the steps after iii in option A are not affecting the substituents. Maybe they are used for something else. But I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is in option D.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate → nitro group at position 1.
ii) Reduce → amine at position 1.
iii) Diazotize → diazonium chloride at position 1.
iv) H3PO2 → maybe decompose the diazonium to something else.
v) Brominate → Br somewhere.
vi) Acetylate → acetyl at some position.
vii) Nitrate again → another nitro group.

But the target has only one nitro group. So, this would add a second nitro, which is not wanted. So, option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's think about the correct order again. The correct order must be acetylation first (step i), then nitration (step iii), then bromination (step ii). But none of the options have nitration before bromination. So, perhaps the correct option is A, even if the later steps are not necessary.

But then, why are the later steps present? Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in the synthesis, after acetylation, nitration is done, then bromination. But in the options, only option A has the acylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So, perhaps the correct order is A's steps i, ii, iii. Then, perhaps steps iv to vii are something else, but the product is formed at step iii.

But in the options, each option has seven steps, which suggests that all steps are needed. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is acetylation after nitration and bromination. But as I thought earlier, that's impossible because Friedel-Crafts requires an active ring. So, perhaps the correct order is nitrate, brominate, then acetylate. But that can't happen because the ring is deactivated.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to introduce the nitro group first, then brominate, then acetylate. But again, Friedel-Crafts won't work after nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach, like using a directing group that allows multiple substitutions.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine is introduced after the nitro group, but that would require the ring to be activated, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine, but that would require nitration to occur on a ring with bromine. Since bromine is a meta director, the nitro would go meta to bromine. Then, acetylation would go meta to the nitro group.

But in that case, the acetyl would be at a position that's meta to nitro and para to bromine. But I'm not sure if that matches the target.

Wait, the target has acetyl at 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, let's say the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the order would be acetylation, then bromination (meta to acetyl), then nitration (meta to acetyl or Br?).

Wait, after acetylation (1), bromination adds Br at 3. Then, nitration adds nitro at 5, which is meta to Br (since Br is at 3, meta is 6 and 2? No, wait. Wait, in benzene, each substituent has two meta positions. So, for a substituent at position 3, the meta positions are 6 and 2. But position 5 is not meta to Br at 3. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in numbering.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

If the acetyl is at position 1, then the meta positions are 3 and 5. So, bromination would add Br at 3 or 5. Suppose it adds Br at 3. Then, nitration would look for meta to acetyl (positions 3 and 5). Since 3 is already occupied by Br, nitro would go to position 5.

So, after steps i (acetylation), ii (bromination), iii (nitration), we have acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the target is achieved.

Looking at the options, which option has this sequence?

Option A: i) acetylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. So, that's exactly the correct sequence.

But then, the rest of the steps in option A would change the substituents. So, why are they included?

Ah, wait. Maybe the steps after iii in option A are for further substitution, but in the target, those substituents are not needed. So, perhaps option A is incorrect because those steps would alter the product.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are not part of the correct pathway. So, the correct sequence is only the first three steps of option A.

But the options include all seven steps as part of the sequence. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is not introduced via electrophilic substitution. Could it be introduced via a different method, like a coupling reaction? But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs after bromination because bromine is a better director than the acetyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: after acetylation, nitration is done, which adds nitro at position 5. Then, bromination adds Br at position 3, which is meta to the nitro group. So, in this case, the order is acetylation, nitration, bromination.

But looking at the options, none of them have this sequence.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B. Let me reevaluate option B.

Option B's steps: i) Br, ii) nitrate, iii) acy. But after step i, bromobenzene is formed. Then, step ii: nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to Br). Then, step iii: acetylation. But Friedel-Crafts won't proceed because the ring is deactivated by Br and NO2. So, this is not possible. So, option B is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me think differently. The target has three substituents: acetyl, Br, nitro. The acetyl is an activating group? No, Friedel-Crafts adds an acetyl, which is deactivating due to the electron-withdrawing effect. So, the ring is less reactive after acetylation.

So, after acetylation, the next substitution (nitration) is possible but the ring is less reactive than benzene. So, nitration after acetylation would require harsher conditions, but it's possible.

Then, after nitration, the ring is more deactivated, so bromination would be difficult. But perhaps it's possible under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added via a different mechanism, like a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strongly activating groups, like NH2, which we don't have here.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added via a directed metallation, but that's not part of the options given.

Hmm, I think I'm not making progress. Based on the initial analysis, the correct sequence should be acetylation, then nitration, then bromination. But none of the options have this exact sequence. The only option that starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration is option A. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the later steps which might not be relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, option C's steps: i) nitrate → nitro at position 1. ii) reduce → amine at position 1. iii) acy. → acetyl would go ortho or para to amine. So, acetyl at position 3 or 5. Then, step iv: brominate → where? So, after acetyl, which is deactivating, bromination would add at meta. Then, step v: nitrate again. But the target only has one nitro group, so this is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Based on the initial analysis, I think the correct sequence is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I can't see how.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine because the bromine is a better director for the nitro group.

But after bromination, the ring is deactivated, making nitration difficult. So, perhaps the correct order is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is acetylation, bromination, nitration, as in option A. So, the steps in option A would produce the target. Even though the later steps (iv to vii) are present, perhaps they are not part of the actual synthesis path, but the question is only about the initial steps. But no, the question states the entire sequence.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are about the position of the substituents. For example, after acetylation, bromination, nitration, the substituents are at 1,3,5. Then, perhaps steps iv to vii are about activating other positions or ensuring the correct stereochemistry, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are a distractor, and the correct answer is option A, as it correctly adds the substituents in the first three steps.

I think I've thought through all possible angles, and option A is the only one that starts with acetylation, then bromination, then nitration, leading to the correct substituent positions. Even though the later steps might seem unnecessary, perhaps they are part of a more complex synthesis pathway, but the initial steps correctly form the target.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the substituents (acetyl, bromine, and nitro groups) are introduced in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has an acetyl group at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5, which corresponds to a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Steps**:  
     i) Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃): Adds the acetyl group at position 1.  
     ii) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃): Adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the acetyl group).  
     iii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds nitro at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).  
     iv) Fe/HCl: Likely reduces the nitro group to an amine, which would alter the desired product.  
     Subsequent steps (v–vii) introduce additional reactions that are unnecessary for the target molecule.  
   - **Conclusion**: While the first three steps correctly place the substituents, the later steps (iv–vii) would modify the product, making this option incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Steps**:  
     i) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃): Adds bromine at position 1.  
     ii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds nitro at position 3 (meta to bromine).  
     iii) Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃): Adds acetyl at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
     iv) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds another nitro group, which is not desired.  
   - **Conclusion**: Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after nitration and bromination due to the deactivated ring. Additionally, the target molecule only requires one nitro group, so this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Steps**:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds nitro at position 1.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl): Converts the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃): Adds acetyl at position 3 or 5 (ortho/para to the amine).  
     iv) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃): Adds bromine at position 5 (meta to the acetyl group).  
     v) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds another nitro group, which is not desired.  
   - **Conclusion**: The target molecule only requires one nitro group, and the sequence does not align with the correct substituent positions. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Steps**:  
     i) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds nitro at position 1.  
     ii) Reduction (Fe/HCl): Converts the nitro group to an amine.  
     iii) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl): Converts the amine to a diazonium salt.  
     iv) H₃PO₂: Likely decomposes the diazonium salt, substituting the amino group.  
     v) Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃): Adds bromine at position 3.  
     vi) Acetylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃): Adds acetyl at position 5.  
     vii) Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄): Adds another nitro group, which is not desired.  
   - **Conclusion**: The target molecule only requires one nitro group, and the sequence does not align with the correct substituent positions. This option is incorrect.

### Final Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is **acetylation, bromination, and nitration**. Among the given options, **Option A** is the only one that begins with the correct sequence of steps (i–iii). However, the subsequent steps (iv–vii) in Option A are unnecessary and would alter the product. Despite this, Option A is the closest match to the correct synthesis pathway.

**Answer: A**
