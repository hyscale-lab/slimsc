Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for each state.

Wait, but each spin can be +1 or -1. That means there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all.

Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. Let me think of them as binary, but I'll just write them out as S1,S2,S3:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these, I need to compute E and then exp(-βE). But wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term is the product of two spins.

Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

Let's take the first state: all +1. So S1S2 is 1*1=1, same for the other terms. So 1+1+1=3. E = -J *3 = -3J.

Second state: S3 is -1. S1S2 is 1*1=1, S1S3 is 1*(-1)=-1, S2S3 is 1*(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Third state: S2 is -1. S1S2 = 1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3= (-1)*1=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J again.

Fourth state: S2 and S3 are -1. So S1S2 = 1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

Fifth state: similar to second. S1 is -1. S1S2= (-1)*1=-1, S1S3= (-1)*1=-1, S2S3=1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me recalculate. State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

So S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1
S1S3 = (-1)(1) = -1
S2S3 = (1)(1) = 1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1 → E = J.

Hmm, wait, that's same as state 2,3,4.

Wait, let's go through all states.

State 1: all +1 → sum 3 → E= -3J.

State 2: S3=-1 → sum 1 -1
