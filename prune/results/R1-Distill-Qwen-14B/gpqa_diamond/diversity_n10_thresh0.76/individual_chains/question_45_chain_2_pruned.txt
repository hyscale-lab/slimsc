Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again. So, four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Hmm, wait. Identical particles with spin-1/2. Oh right, that means they are fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy unit provided. So for a single particle, the energy levels are 1E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc. But since we have four particles, all must be in different states.

Wait wait, but each particle is spin-1/2, so each has two possible spin states. So in the well, each spatial state can hold up to two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down. Oh right, because the Pauli exclusion principle only prohibits identical quantum states. So for each energy level, two particles can be placed with opposite spins.

Wait no, wait. The exclusion principle says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. So each particle must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for each energy level (n), there are two possible spin states. So each n can have two particles: spin up and spin down.

So, in a one-dimensional well with four identical fermions, how are they filled?

The ground state would be the lowest energy, then the first excited, then second excited. So let's think of the states as filled in order of increasing energy.

The ground state is n=1. Since we have two spin states, two particles can go here. Then the next lowest energy is n=2. Another two particles can go there. Wait, but wait, we have four particles. So in the ground state, we fill n=1 with two particles (spin up and
