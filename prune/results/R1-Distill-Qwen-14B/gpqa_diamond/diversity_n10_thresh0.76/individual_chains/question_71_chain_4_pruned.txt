Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.

The question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, right? But I think that's more about how they were discovered, not directly relevant to the question. So the important part is that they are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, that's like Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 2.5P, Planet_4 3.5P, and Planet_5 5P. Or maybe it's the other way around, like their periods are in that ratio, so Planet_1's period is the smallest, and each subsequent planet's period is a multiple of the first.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They all have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't factor into the calculation. Equilibrium temperature is based on the energy balance, right? I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance, R_star is the star's radius, and T_star is the star's effective temperature. But wait, sometimes the formula is written as T = T_star * (L_star/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) ), but if all the planets are around the same star, then L (luminosity) is the same, and R and T_star would be the same too. So perhaps a simplified version applies.

Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * ( ( (1 - albedo) ) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( ( R_star ) / ( a * sqrt(1-e^2) ) ) )^0.5. But since the orbits are circular (e=0), the sqrt(1-e^2) is 1, so that term is gone. Also, albedo is the same for all, so the (1-albedo)/2 term would be same for all planets. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend only on their orbital distances and the star's properties.

But since all planets orbit the same star, R_star and T_star are the same for all. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature inversely depends on the square root of the semi-major axis (a). So, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_4 to Planet_2, then take the inverse square root, I can find the temperature ratio.

But wait, how do I relate the orbital periods to their semi-major axes? Oh, Kepler's third law! The law states that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G M_star)/(4 π²), so a^3 is proportional to P^2. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, a_4 / a_2
