Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses a different starting material and reagent. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is asking how many peaks the chemist will observe in each chromatogram.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's break them down.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone at position 3 of a hexane chain, with a methoxy group at position 5. The structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-OCH3 (but wait, more accurately, it's hexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, let me think. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but the 5th carbon is substituted with methoxy. So it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

So when LAH reduces the ketone (CO), it becomes a CHOH group. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but waitâ€”LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can also reduce ethers? No, wait, LAH usually reduces esters, ketones, aldehydes, etc., but ethers are generally not reactive towards LAH. So the methoxy group (OCH3) should remain as is.

So the product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Because the starting material was a chiral center (the S configuration at C5), the product will retain that. And the new hydroxyl group at C3 will form a new chiral center. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is:

Positions 1 to 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Position 3 has the ketone (C=O), position 5 has OCH3.

When reduced with LAH, the ketone (C=O) becomes CH(OH). So, the carbon chain becomes:

CH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2-OCH3.

Wait, wait, no. The actual structure would be:

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3.

But with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So
