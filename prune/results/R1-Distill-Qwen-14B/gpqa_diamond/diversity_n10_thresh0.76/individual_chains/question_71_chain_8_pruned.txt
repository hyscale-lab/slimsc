Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system with five exoplanets. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All five planets have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light they reflect. The question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm. So equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet reaches when the incoming solar radiation is balanced by the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I remember for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_earth * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) * (a / 1AU)^(-1/2), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the orbital distance, and T_earth is Earth's temperature. But wait, in this problem, all planets orbit the same star, right? So L is the same for all. So the ratio of temperatures would only depend on the distance from the star.

So the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Because the formula for equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. So T ∝ a^(-1/2).

Wait, but the problem gives the orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the first planet has period P1, then P2=2*P1, P3=2.5 P1, P4=3.5 P1, and P5=5 P1. Since all planets orbit the same star, the period is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler's third law. For the same star, P^2 ∝ a^3. So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is a constant.

So the semi-major axes are proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of a4 to a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let's compute that.

P4 is 3.5 times P1, and P2 is 2 times P1.
