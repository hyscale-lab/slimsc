Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, the question gives me some phase shifts, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that phase shifts are related to scattering amplitudes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave analysis is given by a sum over all the angular momentum states. The formula, if I remember correctly, is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ), where δ_l are the phase shifts for each l. Oh right, and k is the wave number.

But wait, the question is asking for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which I think corresponds to θ = 0 degrees. Oh, because the incident beam is along the original direction, so when the scattering angle is 0, that's the forward direction.

In that case, the expression for the imaginary part might simplify. Because when θ is 0, sinθ is zero, but the amplitude should have a specific form. Wait, I think that for θ=0, the expression becomes purely imaginary. Or maybe the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is the dominant term.

Wait, I should think about the expansion of the scattering amplitude. The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) / (2ik) ) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] P_l(cosθ) e^{iδ_l} or something like that?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The general expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) P_l(cosθ). Because e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ, so e^{2iδ} - 1 = (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i 2 sin δ cos δ. Wait, but maybe a better approach is to note that (e^{iδ} -1 )
