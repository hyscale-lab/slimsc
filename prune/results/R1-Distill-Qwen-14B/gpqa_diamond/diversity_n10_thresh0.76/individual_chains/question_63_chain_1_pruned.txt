Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, diatomic molecules can have both rotational and vibrational energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. When a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to transition to a higher state.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I'm guessing that the molecule can transition either by increasing its rotational quantum number or its vibrational quantum number. But since it's a diatomic, maybe the model combines both rotation and vibration.

Wait, no. The quantum rotation-vibration model is a bit different. I think it's a way to model the energy levels considering both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. But I'm not exactly clear on that.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor modelâ€”I remember that the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, hence it's vibrational as well. So maybe the energy levels include both rotational and vibrational contributions.

But the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state. So, the molecule
