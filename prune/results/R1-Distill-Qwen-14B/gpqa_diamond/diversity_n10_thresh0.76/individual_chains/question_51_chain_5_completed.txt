Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the concepts step by step.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conducting spheres and charges placed near them, image charges come into play. Oh right, because the conducting sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to the earth, so the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero.

So the setup is: a point charge q is outside a grounded conducting sphere. The sphere will have induced charges. The induced charges will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Wait, but how do I model this? I think the method of images can help here. 

Using the method of images, I can replace the conducting sphere with an image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' will be inside the sphere. Wait, no, wait. The charge q is placed outside the sphere, so the image charge should be inside, right? Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the image charge would be at a position related to the distance d and the sphere's radius R.

Wait, the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is such that the image is inside the sphere. The formula for the image charge is based on the distance d from the center. So, the image charge q' would be located at a distance of R^2/d from the center, but on the opposite side of the sphere from q. So the distance between the original charge q and the image charge q' would be d + (R^2/d), since the image is R^2/d away from the center towards the opposite direction.

Wait, let me get this straight. The image charge q' is such that the potential due to q and q' on the surface of the sphere is zero. So the sphere is conducting, and the potential on its surface is zero, hence the method of images applies.

The sphere is grounded, so the induced charges on it will adjust so that the potential is zero. The method of images tells us that the charge q induces an image charge q' inside the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge q' is equal to q because the sphere is conducting and neutral (since it's grounded, any induced charge would just flow away, wait no, wait. Wait, no. If the sphere is neutral initially, and you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges would be +q and -q. But since it's grounded, the excess charge on the sphere can't accumulate. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The conducting sphere is initially neutral. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's electrons redistribute. The side near q will have induced negative charges, and the far side will have positive. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess charge can flow to the ground. So the sphere ends up with a charge of -q, but wait no, no. Wait, if q is positive, the induced charge on the sphere is negative on the near side and positive on the far side. But because it's grounded, the overall charge on the sphere is zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, the sphere is a conductor, so any excess charge would reside on the surface. But since it's grounded, the conductor can lose or gain electrons as needed, so it's kept at zero potential.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The conducting sphere is grounded, so the potential of the sphere (i.e., the surface) is the same as the ground's potential, which is considered zero. So the potential at the surface due to the charge q and the image charge q' must be zero. 

In the method of images, for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance r' from the center, where r' is (R^2)/d. So if the original charge is at a distance d from the center, the image is at R²/d from the center. But since the original is outside, the image is inside.

Now, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between the two charges, which are q and q' (the image). Since they are opposite charges? Wait, no, wait. The original charge is q, and the image charge is q', but what's the sign? Hmm, I think for a conducting sphere, the image charge has the same sign as the external charge. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the image charge for a conducting sphere is such that it's like a negative image. No, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let me think about the method of images for a conducting sphere. When a charge q is placed outside, the conducting sphere will have induced charges. The image charge inside the sphere is q', and the potential due to q and q' on the surface of the sphere is zero. So, the image charge inside is -q. No, wait, that can't be right because the sphere is conducting and grounded.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is negative of the original charge. Alternatively, I think for a conducting sphere, the image charge is located at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from the charge q. So the distance between q and q' would be d + (R²/d). Or wait, no. The image is inside the sphere, so the distance from q to the image would be d - (R²/d), but that's only if the image is on the same line. Wait, no, if the original charge is at a distance d from the center, and the image is at a distance R²/d from the center towards the same point, perhaps the separation between q and q' is d - (R²/d). Or wait, no, maybe the image is on the opposite side, so the separation would be d + (R²/d). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact positions.

Wait, let's clarify. The charge q is placed at a distance d from the center. The conducting sphere of radius R is placed there. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so its distance from the center is R²/d. So the distance between q and q' would be d - (R²/d), but wait, that's only if the image is on the same side. Because if the charge is outside, the image is inside on the same line. So for example, if q is at distance d (say, along the x-axis at x = d), then the image would be at x = R²/d, but since d > R, R²/d < R, so it's inside. Therefore, the separation between q and q' is d - (R²/d). Wait, that can't be right because if d is much larger than R, the separation would be roughly d, which is correct. Hmm, but wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the separation is d + (R²/d), because the image is on the opposite side? No, that doesn't make sense. No, no, the image is on the same line, but inside the sphere. So the distance between q and the image is d - (R²/d). But wait, if d is larger than R, R²/d is less than R. So, for example, if the sphere has radius R=1 and d=5, R²/d=1/5, so the image is at 0.2, so the distance between q at 5 and image at 0.2 is 4.8 = 5 - 0.2. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the separation being (d - (R²/d)), but perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for image charge in a conducting sphere. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I remember that the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is given by q' = - (R² q)/(d²). No, wait. Or is it that the image is located at a distance R²/d from the center. So the separation between q and the image is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, but for potential energy between two charges, it's U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q q') / r, where r is the separation. So if the image charge is q' = - q, then U would be negative. Wait, but in this case, what's the image charge?

Wait, the conducting sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. The method says that the image charge is q', and the potential due to q and q' must sum to zero on the surface. So if the charge q is positive, the image charge q' would be negative, because the induced charges on the sphere have to cancel the potential from q.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the potential energy of the system. The system consists of the charge q and the conducting sphere, which because it's grounded, can be considered as having an induced charge that's a function of q's position.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the position d away from the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges adjust to make the potential on the sphere's surface zero. So when you bring q closer, you're doing work against the electric field, which affects the potential energy.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the location of the charge q is due to the conducting sphere. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at point d due to the sphere is zero? No, that can't be right. Wait, the potential at the surface is zero, but the potential elsewhere depends on the charges.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the potential energy of the system as the sum of the potential energies between the charges. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at any point on it is zero. So the potential at a point outside the sphere (like where q is) is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the sphere as having an induced charge -q (because it's grounded, but that's not right because the sphere itself can't have a net charge if it's grounded. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor and initially neutral. When you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's induced charge would be -q on the near side and +q on the far side, but since it's grounded, the charges can flow, leading to the sphere having a net charge of zero. So the induced charge is a redistribution, but the total charge on the sphere remains zero. So the potential due to the sphere at the location of q is the same as the potential due to a point charge at the center of the sphere.

Wait, maybe not. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges are on the surface, and the potential inside a conducting sphere is uniform. Wait, but the point q is outside, so the potential it experiences is due to the induced charges on the sphere. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be treated as a point charge at the center. So the potential at a distance d from the center is the same as if all the induced charges were at the center.

So, the sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. The potential at any point on the sphere's surface is zero. The potential at a point outside the sphere (distance d) is due to the induced charges. Let me think, the potential at a distance r from the center due to a charge Q is (k Q)/r. But since the sphere is conducting, the induced charge is such that the potential at the surface (r = R) is zero. So, let me write that.

The potential at r = R (surface) due to the induced charge is zero. So let's say the induced charge is Q. Then, the potential at r = R is (k Q)/R. But since the sphere is grounded, this potential is zero. So (k Q)/R = 0 → Q=0. Wait, that can't be right because we have a charge q near the sphere. So perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the charge q induces a dipole or something on the sphere. No, perhaps the image charge concept is better. The image charge method says that the potential due to q and the image charge q' is zero on the surface of the sphere. So the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the distance from the center to q' is R²/d. The sign of q' is the same as q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the negative of q. Let me think.

If I have the charge q at distance d, the image charge q' is at R²/d from the center, along the same line. The potential at the surface due to both charges must be zero. So the potential at r = R from q is kq/(R), and from q' is k q' / (R - R²/d) ? Wait, no. Wait, the distance from q' to the surface point is (R - (R²/d)), but that's only if the point is on the same line as q and the center. But for a general point on the sphere's surface, the potential due to q and q' must sum to zero. Maybe it's easier to imagine that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, so the sum of potentials from q and q' is zero.

Wait, I might be getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential energy is just the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere. But in this case, the sphere's presence affects the potential at the point where q is placed.

Wait, but the presence of the conducting sphere affects the potential. When you bring the charge q near the sphere, the potential at the location where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges adjust so that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential at the location of q is equal to the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential at the location of q (distance d from center) is the same as the potential due to the image charge q'. Because the image charge is inside the sphere, the potential at the location of q is due to both q and q', but since q is outside, it's easier to think of the image.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system, which would be the work done in bringing the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential at its surface is zero. The potential at the location of q (distance d) is due to the sphere's induced charges. Let me model this.

The induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must be zero on the sphere's surface. So the induced charge can be treated as a point charge Q at the center, such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

So, the potential at the surface (r=R) due to q is (k q)/R, and due to the induced charge Q is (k Q)/R. The sum must be zero:

k q / R + k Q / R = 0 → Q = -q.

Wait, that can't be right because the sphere is grounded, so the induced charge should cancel any net charge. Wait, but if Q is -q, then the sphere's charge would be -q, but since it's grounded, it would neutralize that by allowing electrons to flow, making the net charge zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential at the surface due to the induced charge and the external charge q is zero.

So, the potential at R is (k q)/R + (k Q)/R = 0 → Q = -q.

But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charge can't be -q because that would make the sphere's charge -q, but the ground would neutralize it. So perhaps the induced charge is such that the sphere's potential is zero, which would require the induced charge to be Q = -q, but the sphere being grounded means that the potential is zero, so the induced charge must be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the approach would be that the induced charge Q is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the potential is zero regardless of the charge. That's a contradiction. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the system using the image charge method. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so the separation between q and q' is d + (R²/d). Wait, no, because if q is at distance d, and the image is at R²/d from the center towards the same direction, then the separation would be d - (R²/d). But if d > R, then R²/d < d. So the separation is (d² - R²)/d. So the potential energy U between q and q' is k q q' / [ (d² - R²)/(d) ) ].

Wait, but what is the value of q'? In the method of images for a conducting sphere, the image charge q' has the same magnitude as the external charge q, but opposite sign. So q' = -q?

Wait, no, perhaps q' is positive? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign. Let me think: if the external charge is positive, the sphere's near side will have induced negative charges, and the far side positive. But since it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere remains zero. So the induced charge is a dipole-like arrangement. But in the image method, the image charge is inside the sphere.

Wait, no, the image charge has the same sign as the external charge. Or is it the opposite? Let me think: if the external charge is positive, the image charge inside the sphere would be negative. Because the sphere's surface near the charge will have negative charges, which would attract the positive image charge inside. Or wait, perhaps the image charge is positive and inside.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the assumption that the image charge is q' = q (same sign), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's q' = -q. Let me try.

So, the potential energy U between the two charges is U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them.

If the image charge is q' = -q, then U = - (k q²) / r.

What's the separation r between q and q'? Let's say q is at a distance d from the center, and the image is at a distance R²/d from the center, on the same line. So the separation between them is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = (k q (-q)) / [ (d² - R²)/d ) ] = (- k q² d) / (d² - R²).

But wait, this would make U negative. Let me check the options. Option B is U = -k q² d/(d² - R²), which matches this. But another option has a factor of 1/2. Hmm.

Wait, but in the method of images, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charges together, which is the same as the potential energy between q and q'. But I'm not sure if I should include any other terms, like the energy stored in the sphere itself.

Wait, another approach: when you bring a charge q near a conducting sphere, the potential energy can be found by considering the work done against the electric field of the induced charges. But I'm not finding this approach straightforward.

Alternatively, the net potential energy of the system is the potential energy stored in the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges don't contribute to the potential energy because the sphere is at zero potential. Therefore, the potential energy is just the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position in the potential due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, which implies that the potential at the location of q is the same as the potential due to the image charge q'.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the potential energy between q and the image charge q'. But in the image method, the potential energy of the system is the same as if the image charge were present. So the potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the potential of the other.

Wait, but when you have two charges, the potential energy is (k q q') / r. So if the image charge is q', then U is (k q q')/(r).

Wait, but earlier I thought q' is -q, so U would be negative.

Wait, but let me think again about the image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' is such that the sphere's surface remains at zero potential. So the charge q' must be inside the sphere, and the potential at the surface due to q and q' is zero.

The image charge q' is given by q' = (R² q) / d². Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Another formula I recall is that the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is q' = q * (R/d)^2. Wait, but that would imply the same sign as q. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the image charge in a conducting sphere. From what I remember, the image charge for a point charge q at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere of radius R is q' = q * (R²)/(d²) and is located at a distance R²/d from the center, on the same line as the original charge. So the image charge is inside the sphere, and its magnitude is less than q.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the potential energy between q and q' would be (k q q') / (d - (R²/d)) ) = (k q^2 (R²/d²)) ) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) )

Simplify that:

Numerator: k q^2 R² / d²

Denominator: (d² - R²) /d → multiply numerator and denominator by d:

= k q^2 R² / (d² (d² - R²)/d )

Wait, no, let's compute it step by step. The numerator is k q q' = k q ( q R²/d² ) = k q² R²/d².

The denominator is the separation: d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = (k q² R²/d²) / ( (d² - R²)/d ) ) = (k q² R²/d²) * (d/(d² - R²)) ) = (k q² R² d) / (d² (d² - R²)) )

Simplify: R² d / (d² (d² - R²)) ) → R² / (d (d² - R²)) )

So U = (k q² R² ) / (d (d² - R²)) )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them seem to exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) U= - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d² + R² )

B) U= - k q^2 d/(d² - R² )

C) U= - (1/2)k q^2 R²/(d² - R² )

D) U= - (1/2)k q^2 R/(d² - R² )

Wait, the expression I derived is U = (k q^2 R² ) / (d (d² - R²)) ), which can be rewritten as (k q^2 R² ) / (d^3 - d R² ) ). None of the options match this exactly.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's value. Let me see. Maybe the image charge is q' = - q (R²/d²), so it's negative. Let's try that.

Then, q' = - q R²/d².

So the potential energy U would be (k q (- q R²/d² )) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= - (k q² R²/d²) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= - (k q² R² d ) / (d² (d² - R²) )

Wait, that's - (k q² R² d) / (d² (d² - R²) ) = - (k q² R²) / (d (d² - R²) )

But looking at the options again, that's not matching exactly. Option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² ). Hmm, but my expression is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is half of this, because each pair is counted once. Wait, but potential energy is a single value, so I'm probably missing a factor of ½ somewhere.

Wait, another approach: when you bring a charge q from infinity to a point near the sphere, the work done is equal to the potential at that point multiplied by q. The potential at that point is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which can be treated as an image charge.

Wait, but the image charge method says that the potential energy is the same as if you had the charge q and the image charge q' in free space. So the potential energy is (1/2) times the potential energy of the two charges together.

Wait, because each charge contributes to the potential of the other, so you have to consider both contributions and avoid double-counting. So the potential energy U is (1/2) k q q' / r.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when you bring q1 near q2, the work done is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. So perhaps the correct approach is to take U as (1/2) k q q' / r.

So let me recompute. If q' = - q (R²/d² ), then U = (1/2) k q (- q R²/d² ) / r, where r is the separation.

But what is r? The separation between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R²/d² ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (- q² R² / d² ) * (d/(d² - R²) )

= (1/2) * k * ( - q² R² d ) / (d² (d² - R²) )

= (1/2) * k * ( - q² R² ) / (d (d² - R²) )

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Let me look again. Option C is U=- (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² ). So if d= R, that would be undefined, but perhaps that's a different scenario.

Wait, but in our calculation, the denominator is d (d² - R² ). Option C's denominator is (d² - R² ), so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the separation r correctly. The separation between q and q' is the distance between them, which is d (the distance from the center to q) minus the distance from the center to q' (which is R²/d).

So r = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So putting this into the U expression:

U = (1/2) * k * (q * q') / r.

If q' is - q * (R²/d² ), then:

U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- q R²/d² ) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) * k * [ - q² R² / d² ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ]

= (1/2) * k * [ - q² R² d ] / [ d² (d² - R²) ]

= (1/2) * k * [ - q² R² ] / [ d (d² - R²) ]

Again, this doesn't match any of the options, which suggests I might have made an error in the image charge approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge method isn't the right approach here. Another way to think about it is to compute the potential energy as the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the other's potential.

Wait, but in this problem, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential energy of the system is the energy required to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, against the potential due to the sphere.

So the potential at the location of q due to the sphere is V. Then, the potential energy U is q * V.

But what is V? Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential outside the sphere due to the induced charges can be found using the method of images. The potential at a point outside a conducting sphere is the same as if all the induced charges were at the center.

So, the induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential on the surface is zero. Let me denote the induced charge as Q. The potential at the surface (r = R) due to Q is (k Q)/R. The potential at the surface due to the external charge q is (k q)/R. Since the sum must be zero:

k Q / R + k q / R = 0 → Q = - q.

Wait, but that would mean the sphere has a charge of Q = -q, but since it's grounded, the excess charge would leave, making the sphere's net charge zero. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Another approach: The potential at the location of q (distance d from center) is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Let's model this as a point charge Q located at the center of the sphere. The potential at distance d due to Q is (k Q)/d.

But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface (r = R) is zero. The potential at r = R due to Q is (k Q)/R. Setting this equal to zero (since the sphere's surface is at zero potential), we get Q = 0. That can't be right because then the potential at d would be zero, which implies U = 0, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. I think I'm stuck, so maybe I should look for another way. Let's consider the system's potential energy as the sum of the potential energy of the charge q in the sphere's potential plus the potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential energy of the induced charges would be zero. So the only contribution is the potential energy of the charge q in the sphere's potential.

Wait, but the sphere's potential at the location of q is V. So the potential energy is q V.

But what is V? Since the sphere is grounded and conducting, the potential at any point on its surface is zero. The potential inside the sphere is the same as on the surface. The potential outside is given by the sum of potentials from all charges.

Alternatively, the potential outside the sphere (at d) is due to the charge q and the image charge q'. So the potential at d due to q is (k q)/d, and due to q' is (k q')/ (d - (R²/d)).

But since the sphere is conducting, the potential on its surface (r = R) must be zero. So the sum of the potentials due to q and q' at r = R must be zero.

So, (k q)/R + (k q')/ (R - (R²/d)) ) = 0.

Simplify:

q/R + q'/( R (1 - R/d) ) ) = 0.

Which is q/(R) + q'/( R ( (d - R)/d ) ) ) = 0.

Multiply through by R:

q + q' * d/(d - R) = 0.

Solve for q':

q' * d/(d - R) = - q → q' = - q (d - R)/d.

Hmm, that's an expression for q' in terms of q.

Now, the potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity to its position, which is q times the potential at that position due to the sphere.

But the potential at that position (distance d) is the sum of the potentials due to q and q'. But wait, no, because the sphere is conducting, the potential at d is due to the induced charges, which we've modeled as q'.

Wait, perhaps the potential at d is (k q)/d + (k q') / (d - (R²/d )).

But since the sphere is conducting and the potential on the surface is zero, the potential at d is the same as the potential due to the image charge q', because the potential due to q would be canceled by the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, maybe the potential at d is due to the image charge q' and the charge q itself. But since the system is symmetric, perhaps the potential at d is zero. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the potential at d is the same as the potential due to the image charge q'. Because the sphere's potential is zero, the potential at d is just that due to q'.

So V = (k q') / (d - (R²/d)).

Then, the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k q') / (d - (R²/d)).

Substituting q' from earlier: q' = - q (d - R)/d.

So U = q * [ k (- q (d - R)/d ) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]

Wait, because d - (R²/d) = (d² - R^2)/d.

So U = q * (-k q (d - R)/d ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify denominator: (d² - R²) = (d - R)(d + R).

So,

U = q * (-k q (d - R)/d ) * (d ) / ( (d - R)(d + R) ) )

= q * (-k q (d - R ) ) * d / [ d (d - R)(d + R) ) ]

Wait, the d in the numerator and denominator cancels, as does (d - R):

= q * (-k q) / (d + R )

So, U = - k q² / (d + R )

But looking at the options, this doesn't match any, which suggests I made a mistake in this approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should take a different route. Let me think about the problem again.

The sphere is conducting and grounded, so its potential is zero. The potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. The charge q is placed at a distance d from the center. The induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

The potential energy can be found using the image charge method. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, located at a distance R²/d from the center. The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between q and q'.

If q' is negative, then the potential energy would be negative, as in the options.

Wait, but in the image method, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the two charges together, which would be U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the separation between q and q'.

If q' is negative, then U is negative.

From earlier, the separation r = (d² - R²)/d.

But I'm not sure about the sign of q'. From the earlier equation, when solving for q' such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, we found q' = - q (d - R)/d. Hmm, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is q' = - q R²/d².

Wait, let's think again about the image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge is given by q' = (R²/d²) q, but with the same sign as q. So q' is positive if q is positive.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The correct formula for the image charge when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere is that the image charge q' is located at a distance R²/d from the center, on the same line as q. The magnitude of q' is q (R/d)^2, and its sign is the same as q.

Wait, no, I think the image charge has the same sign as q. So q' is positive if q is positive.

So the separation between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Potential energy U is (k q q') / r = (k q * (q R²/d² )) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= (k q² R² / d² ) * (d / (d² - R² ))

= (k q² R² d) / (d² (d² - R²) )

= (k q² R² ) / (d (d² - R²) )

But none of the options match this. However, option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² ), which is similar but has a negative sign and a factor of ½.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is negative because the charges attract. Since both are positive, the potential energy is positive, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, if q is positive, the image charge q' is also positive, so the potential energy should be positive. But none of the options have a positive U. So perhaps the image charge has the opposite sign.

Wait, maybe the image charge is negative. Let me think again. If the sphere is conducting, the image charge q' has the same magnitude as q, but opposite sign. So q' = - q.

Wait, that would give U = (k q (-q )) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= -k q² d / (d² - R² )

Which matches option B: U = -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 )

But I thought earlier that the image charge is q' = - q R²/d², but perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps when the sphere is conducting and grounded, the image charge is -q. That would make the potential energy U = -k q² d/(d² - R^2 ), which is option B.

But then why is option A using d^2 + R^2 in the denominator?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the image charge for a grounded sphere with that of a non-grounded sphere. For a non-grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is q' = q (R/d)^2, same sign. But for a grounded sphere, perhaps the image charge is -q.

Wait, I think I found a resource in my mind that when the sphere is grounded, the image charge q' is equal in magnitude to q but opposite in sign. So q' = -q. So the separation is d + R, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the separation would be d - (R²/d) as before.

So U = (k q (-q )) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= -k q² d/(d² - R² )

Which is option B.

But wait, earlier I thought that when the sphere is grounded, the image charge is q' = -q. So the potential energy is negative.

But I also remember that the potential energy of the system when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d + R), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is half of the value I calculated because each charge contributes to the potential of the other, and we count each pair once.

So U = (1/2) * ( -k q^2 d/(d² - R^2 ) )

Which would be option A if the denominator is d^2 + R^2, but option C has R^2 in the numerator.

Wait, but if I take the image charge q' = - q, then U = (k q q') / r = (k q (-q )) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= -k q² d/(d² - R² )

Which is option B.

But in the options, option B is U = -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 )

So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because I'm a bit fuzzy on the image charge for a grounded sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the potential energy of the system is the same as the potential energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere's induced charges.

But I'm not sure. Given that, I'll go with option B as the answer.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is conducting and grounded, meaning its surface potential is zero. The method of images is used to simplify the calculation by replacing the induced charges on the sphere with an equivalent image charge inside the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Image Charge**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere is located at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center of the sphere, along the same line as the external charge \( q \). The magnitude of the image charge is equal to the external charge, \( q' = -q \), and it has the opposite sign.

2. **Separation Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance between the external charge \( q \) and the image charge \( q' \) is:  
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the potential energy between the two charges \( q \) and \( q' \), given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k q q'}{r}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( q' = -q \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{k q (-q)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}} = -\frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, the correct match is:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to **Option B**.

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by \( U = -\frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 - R^2} \), which matches **Option B**.
