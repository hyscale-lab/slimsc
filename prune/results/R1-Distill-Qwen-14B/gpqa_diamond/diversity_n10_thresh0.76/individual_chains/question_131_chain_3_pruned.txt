Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups. The 13C NMR peaks might correspond to the carbonyl carbons. Wait, 165 ppm is a carbonyl, probably from the anhydride. The 137 ppm is more like an spÂ² hybridized carbon, maybe part of a double bond.

Wait, the anhydride was formed from a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So the structure of the anhydride should have the two carbonyl groups and a double bond. Since the acid was cis, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, maybe a cyclic structure like a five-membered ring. Because a cyclic anhydride from a diacid would form a ring. So, perhaps it's a cyclopentane or something similar.

Wait, but the product after dehydration is the anhydride, which has a single peak in 1H NMR. A single peak at 7 ppm suggests symmetry. Maybe all the protons are equivalent. Could it be that the anhydride has no protons, like being a fully symmetrical structure? Hmm, but wait, anhydrides usually have some protons unless they're fully substituted.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a bridged structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a maleic anhydride type structure, but that would have some protons. Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a single peak. So, if all the protons are equivalent, that would make sense. So maybe the structure is something like a bicyclic structure where all the protons are equivalent, or perhaps the anhydride has no hydrogen atoms attached to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, another thought: if the anhy
