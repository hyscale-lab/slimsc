Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are that delta l (the change in angular momentum) should be ±1. So, for an electron to transition via a dipole, the angular momentum quantum number l must change by exactly one unit. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1, but I think m must also follow that delta m is 0, ±1, right?

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the electron is going from a higher energy level (n=3) to a lower one (n=1), but with the same l and m. But since it's a two-step process, we have an intermediate state.

Wait, but wait, the initial and final states have l=0. So, the first transition must involve a change in l from 0 to l=1 or l= -1. Oh, but l can't be negative, so l goes to 1. Then, from l=1, it would go back down to l=0.

So the first transition would be from |3,0,0> to |something, l=1, m=...>. Then, the next transition goes to |1,0,0>.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>. So n goes from 3 to 2 (delta n = -1), then 2 to 1 (delta n=-1). Each transition is allowed if the selection rules are followed. Let's check l for each step. First, l goes from 0 to 1, which is allowed (delta l = +1). Second, l goes from 1 down to 0 (delta l = -1), which is allowed. M in the first step goes from 0 to 0, which is allowed (delta m=0). Second step m goes from 0 to 0 again, so delta m=0. So, both transitions are allowed. So this option is a possible decay route.

Option B: 3,0,0 -> 2,1,1 ->1,0,0. So first step, l=0 to 1, which is okay. Then, l=1 to 0, okay. m starts at 0, goes to 1 (delta m=+1, allowed), then m=1 to 0 (delta m=-1, allowed). So this is also possible, but the probabilities differ.

Option C: 3,0,0 ->2,1,-1, then to 1,0,0. So m goes from 0 to -1 (delta m=-1), then from -1 to 0 (delta m=+1). Both allowed. So possible.

Option D: The first part seems to have a typo because it starts with a blank. Oh wait, looking again, the option says |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>. That's similar to option A. So same as A perhaps? Wait, no, the options might have different probability factors.

Wait, wait, the question is about the transition probability. So each step must have a certain probability, and the total might be the product.

I think the probability for each transition is given by the square of the transition dipole moment, which is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or something like that. Or, perhaps more simply, the probability depends on
