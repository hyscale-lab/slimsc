Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't have a single pole isolated. But what does that mean for Maxwell's equations?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. I think the key here is to remember which equations would be affected if isolated poles existed. Let me recall each equation.

First, Maxwell's equations in our universe are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero (second equation), which implies that there are no isolated magnetic poles. So if in this other universe, you can have isolated poles, that must mean that the second equation changes.

Wait, so in our case, ∇·B is zero. If there are isolated poles, like monopoles, then I think the divergence of B would not be zero anymore. Because monopoles are sources for the magnetic field. So the equation would become ∇·B = μ_m ρ, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability or something similar for magnetic charge density.

So the second equation changes. But looking at the question, the options are about which equations are different. The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations are different in this scenario.

Wait, in our universe, the first equation deals with electric charge, and the second with magnetic monopoles (but it's zero). So if there are magnetic monopoles, the second equation changes. What about the others?

The third equation, Faraday's Law, involves the curl of E. I think that equation might remain the same because it deals with changing magnetic fields and induced electric fields. Monopoles wouldn't change that; it's more about the source and the movement.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law, which relates the curl of B to current and displacement current. If there are magnetic monopoles, I'm not sure if this equation changes. Wait, I
