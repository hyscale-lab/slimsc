Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down what's happening.

So, the problem involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then there are three steps, each with a different reagent, leading to product 3. The question is how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound, specifically an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the benzene ring is connected to a propenal group (CH₂CH₂CHO?), wait, no, wait. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So it's benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO group? No, wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(O)H attached to benzene, right? So it's benzene with a propenal (CH₂CH₂CHO) group, but actually, it's C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal-1-aldehyde. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. It's Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Actually, I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Oh wait, no, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that can’t be. Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me think
