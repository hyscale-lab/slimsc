Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both are gas giants, I guess. The planets are in circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) )) )^(1/3) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) ) 

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period. I think the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. 

Alternatively, I remember that the RV method gives K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K is something like:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π/(P)) )^(-1/3) ) 

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the formula in terms of the planet's orbital period. Oh, right, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * P) ) ]^(-1/3) * [ (M_p sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ]

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the formula again. I think K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (
