Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, which I know usually has a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each part of the NMR tells me.

First, the aromatic-H signals. There are two signals, which suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents would likely be in positions that create symmetry. For example, para-substitution would give equivalent protons, but maybe it's ortho? Wait, di-substituted could vary. Oh, but wait, the aromatic signals are two. So maybe the ring has two substituents that are meta to each other? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that split the ring into two types of Hs. Like if the substituents are in the para positions, but that would lead to two sets of equivalent Hs. Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that create a di-substituted ring with two different sets of Hs.

Wait, the ring is 6-membered, so benzene. Di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. For example, para would have two equivalent substituents, leading to two types of H: ortho and meta. Wait no, wait. If substituents are para, the ring will have two sets of Hs: the ortho to substituent A would be equivalent to substituent B's ortho, and the meta would be equivalent. So maybe in the case of para-substituted, you get two aromatic signals. Let me think. Wait, para-substituted benzene would have two substituents opposite each other. The Hs adjacent to substituent A would be equivalent to those adjacent to substituent B because of the symmetry. Then, the two Hs that are meta to each substituent (which are actually the same position in a para-substituted ring) would be equivalent. So that gives two signals for the aromatic Hs. So if the substituents are para, that's possible. Alternatively, if the substituents are ortho, then the symmetry would be different. Let me think, for ortho substitution, the ring may have more complex splitting, but maybe not. Wait, ortho substituents would have three sets of Hs? Like, the Hs adjacent to substituent A are one set, the Hs adjacent to substituent B are another, and the Hs opposite would be a third. But wait, in di-substituted benzene, the number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. So if it's para, two signals. If it's meta, two signals, perhaps. Wait, no, if substituents are meta, then the ring would have maybe three signals? Because the substituents are in positions 1,3, leading to different environments. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think: number of NMR signals for di-substituted benzene.

In para substitution: two substituents opposite each other. The Hs adjacent to substituent A are equivalent to those adjacent to substituent B due to symmetry. The Hs meta to substituent A are equivalent to those meta to substituent B. So that would result in two aromatic signals. So that fits the NMR data.

In meta substitution: substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Then, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent? Maybe not. Because substituent at 1 and 3 would make the ring less symmetric. Wait, maybe in meta substitution, the ring has two substituents in positions that are not opposite. So for a di-substituted benzene ring, the possible substitution patterns are ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4). 

In the case of para substitution, the ring
