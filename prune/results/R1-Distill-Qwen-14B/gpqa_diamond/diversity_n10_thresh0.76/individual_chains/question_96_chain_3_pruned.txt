Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with black hole thermodynamics, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size. 

Alright, the question states that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So, I guess I need to find the area first.

Wait, to find the area, I need the radius of the event horizon. Oh right, the event horizon radius R is related to the mass M of the black hole via R = 2 G M / c². But wait, maybe I can find R directly from the angular size and distance.

Angular size θ is given, and I think the formula relates θ to the size of the object (which is R in this case) and the distance d. The formula is θ ≈ R / d, but only if θ is small, which it is here. Because θ is in degrees, but I think I need to convert it into radians to use the formula correctly. Oh, right, because when θ is small in radians, sinθ ≈ θ ≈ tanθ.

So, converting θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad is (1e-17) * (π / 180). Let me calculate that. π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is approximately 0.01745 radians per degree. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but R ≈ θ_rad * d. Because for small angles, tanθ ≈ θ, and R
