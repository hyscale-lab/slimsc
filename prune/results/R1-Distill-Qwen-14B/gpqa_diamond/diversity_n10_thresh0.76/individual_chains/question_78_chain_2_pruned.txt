Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that potentials are important in calculating electric and magnetic fields. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. Tr is the time when the electromagnetic field was generated. The charge q is moving with velocity v at that time, and the observation point is r. 

Wait, I think potentials are usually functions of position and time. So, I should recall the expressions for V and A when a charge is moving. Oh right, when charges are moving, you have to consider both the electric and magnetic contributions, but potentials are still scalar and vector respectively.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a moving charge is similar to the static case but might have some modifications because of the motion. For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But when the charge is moving, things change because of the finite speed of light and the retarded time.

Wait, the problem mentions that d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d. So, d would be r minus the position of the charge at tr, right? Or maybe it's just the vector pointing from the charge's position to r, so d = r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position at time tr.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. Oh right, for a moving charge, the scalar and vector potentials are given by certain expressions involving the velocity and the distance between the charge's position at the retarded time and the observation point.

The scalar potential V is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - d·v)] ) * (1/(something)). Wait, no, I think it's more like this. The scalar potential for a moving charge at time t is V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - d
