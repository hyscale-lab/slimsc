Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf [ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y)]. Hmm, I think this is describing an interaction where the boson X couples to fermions. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, so the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. To find the allowed decays, I need to consider the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into. But which ones?

I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of their masses must be less than the mass of the boson. So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Let me list the masses of all the known fermions to see which ones are below 3 GeV. I think the masses are as follows (in GeV/c², but for energy purposes, we can treat them as GeV):

- Up quark: about 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark: similar, around 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark: about 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark: around 1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: around 4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos: super light, but I think in many models they're considered massless or nearly so.

Wait, but in this problem, are neutrinos being considered? The Lagrangian involves ψ_f, which are fermions, but since neutrinos are leptons, maybe. But if the neutrino mass is negligible, then perhaps they can be ignored unless the process requires them. But the decay X→νν̄ would require that X has a component coupling to neutrinos, which this Lagrangian might not necessarily have. Wait, the Lagrangian is written as λf times ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, f here is a fermion species, like up, down, strange, charm, etc. So if X couples to all fermions, then perhaps any fermion pair can be produced. But wait, the problem states that the interaction is given
