Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I'm supposed to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. All have the same albedo, 0.3, which is Earth-like.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, its albedo, and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is something like T = [(L/(16πσ))*( (1-A)/d^2 )]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is albedo, and d is the orbital distance. Oh wait, but all three planets orbit the same star, so L and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for all. Also, albedo A is same for all, 0.3.

So the equilibrium temperature depends on (1-A)/(d^2). But wait, since all have same A, the ratio of temperatures would just be sqrt of the inverse ratio of distances. Let me think. Because T ∝ sqrt( (L (1-A) ) / (16 π σ d^2) )... but since L, A, and σ are same, T ∝ 1/d^0.5. So higher T means closer to the star.

The question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Wait, but wait, if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, that suggests it's closer. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). So if T1 is higher than T2, d1 is smaller than d2. So, d2 = d1 * (T1/(T2))^2? Wait, no, because T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), so T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So (T1/T2)^2 = d2/d1. So d2 = d1 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say T1 is the temperature of Planet1. Then T1 = [ (L (1-A) )/(16 π σ d1^2) ]^(1/4). Similarly, T2 = [ (L (1-A) )/(16 π σ d2^2) ]^(1/4). Taking the ratio T1/T2, it's [ (d2^2)/(d1^2) ]^(1/4). Which is [ (d2/d1)^2 ]^0.25 = (d2/d1)^0.5. So (T1/T2) = sqrt(d2/d1). So (d2/d1) = (T1/T2)^2.

So, given T1/T2 = 1.4, then d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 ≈ 1.96. So d2 ≈ 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, the ratio between T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Using the same logic, (d3/d2) = (T2/T3)^2. So d3 = d2 * (T2/T3)^2. But wait, T2 is the temperature of Planet2, and T3 is Planet3. Since T2 > T3, Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So d3 is larger than d2.

Wait, wait. Let's compute it. T2/T3=2.3. So (d3/d2) = (T2/T3)^2. So d3 = d2 * (2.3)^2. Let's calculate that: 2.3
