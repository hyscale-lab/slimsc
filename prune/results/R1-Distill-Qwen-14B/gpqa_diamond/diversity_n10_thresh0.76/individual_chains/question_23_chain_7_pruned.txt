Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide, and then looking at the products via TLC. The reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which option correctly identifies the products.

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw this structure mentally. So, the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a but-3-en-1-yl group, which is four carbons long with a double bond starting at the third carbon. And that substituent also has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is O-benzene attached to CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So that's CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but but has four carbons. The but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2CH2-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no. Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but then the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, that would make it an allyl group but longer? No, perhaps better to write the structure.

But-3-en-1-yl: carbon 1 is the connecting point (the oxygen is attached to carbon 1). Then carbon 1 is CH₂-, carbon 2 is CH₂-, carbon 3 is CH₂-, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4? So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-
