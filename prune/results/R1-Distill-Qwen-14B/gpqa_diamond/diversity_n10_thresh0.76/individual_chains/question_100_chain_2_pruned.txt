Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or propyne, but wait, propene is more likely because it's an alkene. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. C3H6 has a degree of unsaturation of 2. So it could be either a cyclopropane or an alkene (propene) or an alkyne (propyne). But when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a typical addition reaction. So probably it's an alkene or alkyne.

Wait, but CCl4 is a solvent, and for alkenes, bromine adds across the double bond. For alkynes, bromine could add as well. But I think in this case, since the first step is bromination, I'll assume it's an alkene—so A is propene (CH2=CHCH3). So compound A is propene.

So compound A (propene) reacts with bromine in CCl4. That's a dibromination, adding across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually dehydrohalogenates (elimination reaction). Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH is added, it might eliminate two HBr molecules. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane—elimination would form an alkene. But wait, where will the double bond form? If both Br are on adjacent carbons, eliminating from each would lead to a double bond between C1 and C2. So the product C would be propene again, right? Or wait, since propene is the starting material, but maybe it's another isomer. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3; if elimination occurs from 1,2-dibromopropane, you get the same propene. So compound C is propene again?

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. When 1,2-dibromopropane undergoes elimination with alcoholic KOH,
