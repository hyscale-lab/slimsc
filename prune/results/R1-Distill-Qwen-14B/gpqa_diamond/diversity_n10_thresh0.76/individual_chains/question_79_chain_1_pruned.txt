Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the original compound X is. Let's see what information I have.

The compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to use that to determine what X was.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane used for? Oh right, that's a common reagent for the Sharpless epoxidation. But wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides from diols or something else? No, wait, Sharpless epoxidation is for making epoxides from epoxide formation from epoxides, more specifically from epoxidizing epoxides, but wait, no. Wait, no, Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing double bonds, especially asymmetric epoxidation. So if compound X is reacting with that reagent, perhaps X has a double bond that gets epoxidized to form an epoxide.

Wait no, wait. Sharpless epoxidation is used to epoxidize certain types of double bonds, particularly those where the resulting epoxide will have a specific stereochemistry. So compound X probably has a double bond that, upon reaction with this reagent, forms an epoxide. So the product is an epoxide of some sort.

But wait, the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So I see two singlets integrating to 3H each. These are likely methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like maybe an oxygen or a benzene ring in a position where they don't have neighboring protons. Wait, but in the case of a benzene ring, if the methyl is attached in a way that it's symmetric, like para to another group or something.

Then, the aromatic protons: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because the integration is 1+2+1+2 =6H. So maybe it's a pattern of two doublets each with 2H, and two more doublets with 1H each? Or perhaps it's a substituent on a benzene ring.

Wait, let me think. Let's count the number of signals. 2 singlets (3H each), and four aromatic signals. So perhaps the compound has two methyl groups and a substituted benzene ring.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So the carbons: two methyl groups (21.3 and 28.4), a bunch of aromatic carbons, and then some other carbons. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, maybe an epoxide or something else. Wait, epoxides are ethers, but their carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm. Hmm, wait. Alternatively, 197 ppm is very high. Maybe it's a carbonyl group, like a ketone? Or a carbonyl in some other structure.

Wait, but the product is formed via a Sharpless epoxidation. So perhaps the starting material had a double bond, and the product is an epoxide. So the product would have an epoxide group, which would have two adjacent carbons each connected to an oxygen. In the 13C NMR, the carbons in the epoxide are usually in the 50-60 ppm range. But I don't see any carbons in that range. The highest is 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Hmm. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not an epoxidation. Wait, what else could 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane be used for? Oh, wait, it's also used as a base in certain reactions. For example, in the Corey-Fuchs reaction, or maybe in some elimination reactions? Alternatively, it's the H-Bond donor in certain reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a Mitsunobu reaction, but Mitsunobu typically uses DEAD and a phosphine.

Wait, no, Mitsunobu uses diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) and triphenylphosphine. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a solvent, but the question says it's the reagent.

Wait, perhaps it's a base used in an elimination reaction. Maybe the starting material
