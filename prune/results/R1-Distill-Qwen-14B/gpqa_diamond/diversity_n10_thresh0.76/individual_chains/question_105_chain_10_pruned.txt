Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the light curve, similar to an exoplanet transit. I remember that exoplanets cause a dip in brightness when they pass in front of the star, and the depth of that dip depends on the planet's size relative to the star.

The star in question has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is about the same as R_sun. Wait, I should just treat R_star as R for now, since it's the same as the Sun.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh, wait, the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So each spot is cooler, I think. The spots are 1000 K cooler. So their temperature is 5000 K.

The question is about the photometric variations. Because the star is rotating, the spots will come into and go out of view as it spins. If only one hemisphere is spotty, the brightness variations will be periodic as the spots rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere.

But the key is to compare this to an exoplanet transit. So the scenario is that the observed brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause when it transits. We need to find the radius of such a planet relative to the star's radius.

Wait, the problem says, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots. So the amplitude of the brightness dip caused by the planet should match the dip from the spots.

So, let's break it down. Let's model each scenario.

First, the star with spots. When a spot is on the side facing us, it contributes less light because it's cooler. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR^2 * σ * Teff^4. But with spots, the total luminosity is a bit less. When a spot comes into view, the observed flux decreases.

But the key is the change in flux when the star rotates. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So each spot's area is 0.2 times (2πR² / 2) = 0.2 * π R². Because a hemisphere is (2πR² / 2) = π R². Wait, no. The area of a hemisphere is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR²? No, wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere is 2πR². So each hemisphere's area is 2πR², and the spots cover 20% (0.2) of that. So spot area per hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Wait, but wait, the filling factor is 20%, so each hemisphere's spot coverage is 0.2, so the area is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

But wait, the star has one hemisphere covered in spots, so when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum brightness variation would be when the maximum number of spots is visible. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the brightness variation.

The flux from the star is F = L / (4π d²), but maybe we can consider the variation relative to the star's total flux.

The star's total flux without spots is F0 = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. When a spot is present, the flux from that area is F_spot = 4π R^2 σ (T_spot)^4 * (Area_spot / (4π R^2)) ) = (Area_spot) σ T_spot^4
