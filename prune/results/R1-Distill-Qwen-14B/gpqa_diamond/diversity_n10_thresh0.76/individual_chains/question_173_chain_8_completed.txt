Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position, Δx, and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and Δx is 0.1 nanometers. But wait, the problem says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy. So I think I need to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Oh right, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. And since momentum p is mass times velocity, but here the speed is given, so maybe I can approximate p as m*v. But wait, the speed is given, but for an electron, the uncertainty in velocity might be small? Or maybe I can use the given v as an estimate for the momentum uncertainty.

Wait, no. The Heisenberg principle gives a relation between Δx and Δp. So solving for Δp, we get Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Since ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let me compute Δp. First, convert Δx into meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters.

So Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10). Let me calculate that. 2e-10 is the denominator. So 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, I think I should remember that the uncertainty principle gives a lower bound, so perhaps I can just use the approximation Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx) without the 1/2 factor, since it's an estimate. So maybe it's easier to ignore the 1/2 for estimation purposes. So 1e-34 / 1e-10 = 1e-24? Wait, wait, ħ is about 1e-34, divided by 1e-10 m gives 1e-24 kg·m/s. So Δp ≈ 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, with that Δp, I can find the uncertainty in energy. But wait, how? Because energy is related to momentum. For a particle moving at speed v, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe I should use the relativistic relation or just the classical one. But since electrons are small particles, perhaps using the non-relativistic approach is okay.

Alternatively, I could think of the uncertainty in energy as being related to the uncertainty in momentum, since E = p²/(2m). So ΔE would be approximately (Δp)²/(2m). Let me check that.

Yes, because E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in E would be (Δp)^2/(2m). So plugging in the numbers: (1e-24)^2 is 1e-48. Divided by 2m, where m is the mass of the electron, which is about 9.11e-31 kg. So denominator is 2 * 9.11e-31 = approx 1.8e-30.

So 1e-48 / 1.8e-30 ≈ 5.56e-19 J. Wait, but that's 5.56e-19, which is about 1e-18? No, wait, 5.56e-19 is an order of 1e-19. So looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, option A is 1e-18.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere? Because earlier, I considered Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), but when I used it for the calculation, I used Δp as ħ/(Δx) without the 2. So maybe I should include the 2.

Let me recalculate with the exact formula. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, Δx is 1e-10 m. So Δp = (1e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = (1e-34) / (2e-10) ) = (0.5e-24) kg·m/s = 5e-25 kg·m/s.

So then, ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m). So (5e-25)^2 is 25e-50. Divided by 2m, which is 2 * 9.11e-31 kg = ~1.8e-30 kg.

So 25e-50 / 1.8e-30 = approx (25/1.8) * 1e-20 = approximately 13.89e-20 = 1.389e-19 J.

So that's about 1.4e-19 J, which is in the 1e-19 range. So the closest option is C) ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: perhaps the uncertainty in energy isn't just the kinetic energy. Because the electron has rest mass energy, but the uncertainty in energy is in the kinetic part? Or is there another approach?

Alternatively, perhaps using the time-energy uncertainty principle. But I'm not sure. The time uncertainty would be related to the energy uncertainty, but I don't have a time here. The position uncertainty is given, so the momentum uncertainty is more straightforward.

Wait, another approach: Using the uncertainty principle for energy and time, ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But I don't know Δt here. Hmm, but perhaps that's not the way to go since the problem gives a spatial uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in energy is directly related to the kinetic energy uncertainty, which comes from the momentum uncertainty. So I think the earlier approach is correct.

So the calculation gives about 1.4e-19 J, which is ~1e-19 J. So option C is the correct answer.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainties in position (\( \Delta x \)) and momentum (\( \Delta p \)) as:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), and \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Solving for \( \Delta p \), we get:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) through the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( m \approx 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.
