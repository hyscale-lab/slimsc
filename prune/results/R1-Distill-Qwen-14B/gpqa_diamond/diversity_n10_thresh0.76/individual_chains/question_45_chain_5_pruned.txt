Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The question says there are four identical particles, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states. The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Wait, the well is one-dimensional and infinite, so the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And they've defined E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 is 1E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each particle has a spin of 1/2. Since they're identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n and the spin. Oh wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, each state can have two possible spin states: up and down.

So I think each energy level can hold two particles because of the two spin states. Because for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the system has four particles. Let me think about how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state is the lowest energy possible. The first energy level is n=1, which can hold two particles (spin up and down). The next level is n=2, which can also hold two. So wait, four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. But wait, hold on: each n level can hold two particles because of the two spins. So for four particles, we'd fill n=1 (2), then n=2 (another 2). So the ground state would have all four particles in the two lowest energy levels.

Wait, no, because each n can take two particles (each with a different spin). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2. So the energy would be the sum of all their individual energies.

So each particle in n
