Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then the question presents two parts, A and B. Let's parse each part.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shifting of a double bond, leading to different isomers. For example, in carbonyl compounds, this can happen when there's a conjugated system that allows for such a shift. 

Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. But in any case, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Does it exhibit tautomerism? I think not because both carbonyl groups are in conjugated positions. Wait, wait, if both are in para positions or adjacent, can they tautomerize? Maybe not, because the hydrogen isn't in a position to shiftâ€”like in a diketone. Alternatively, maybe the quinone structure doesn't have any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen double bonds. So, the carbonyl groups are at adjacent positions? No, benzoquinone is either 1,2 or 1,4. Wait, for example, 1,4-benzoquinone would have two ketone groups across from each other on the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is on a benzene ring, each with adjacent CH groups? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is a six-membered ring. So, if the quinone is 1,4, then the two carbonyl groups are attached to positions 1 and 4. So, each carbon would have a double bond to O, but in that case, are there any H's adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group? Because for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. 

Wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. Let me draw it out mentally. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to two benzene carbons. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two Hs. Wait, no, because the ring is fused, so each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbons) would be part of the ring. But in benzene, each carbon is bonded to one CH group. So, the carbonyl is attached to a benzene where the adjacent carbons are each bonded to two Hs. So, does that mean there are H's alpha to the carbony
