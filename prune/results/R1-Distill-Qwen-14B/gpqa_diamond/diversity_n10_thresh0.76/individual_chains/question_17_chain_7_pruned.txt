Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and we're given that the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex means. I think "stoichiometric" here refers to the molar ratio. So, in the complex, each Ca²+ ion is bound to one EDTA^4- ion. So the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part.

Wait, but EDTA is usually in the form Y^4−. So when Ca²+ binds with EDTA^4−, it forms the complex CaY²−. So the formula is CaY²−, and the stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ca²+ and EDTA.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

The problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in this solution. Because even though the complex is formed, some of it dissociates, releasing Ca²+ ions into the solution.

So the reaction we're looking at is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−

But wait, the K given is the formation constant, Kf, right? Or is it the dissociation constant? Wait, Kf is the formation constant, which is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. So Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but the question gives K as "KCa-EDTA" which I think is the formation constant. So KCa-EDTA is the formation constant Kf.

So Kf = 5x10^10. That's a very large K, which means the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4
