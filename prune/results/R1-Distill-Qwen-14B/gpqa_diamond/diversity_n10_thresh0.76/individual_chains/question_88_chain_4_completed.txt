Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivered them via oral gavage. So, these proteins are probably entering the mouse's digestive system. But then, some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Hmm, I remember that stomach acid is really strong, like HCl, which can break down proteins. So the GFP, which is a protein tag, might be getting degraded in the stomach. But then, some of them reached the intestinal mucus and got stuck there before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Intestinal mucus... I think that's part of the gut's defense, trapping pathogens.

They observed the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Peyer patches are these specialized structures in the small intestine, part of the mucosal immune system. They're where a lot of immune responses happen, especially for things that come into contact with the gut, like oral vaccines or pathogens.

Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and saw high variability. Wait, variable heavy chains are part of the antibodies. High variability in their sequences suggests that the B cells are diversifying their antibodies. But when does that happen?

The options are about different processes. Let's think about each:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process that occurs in B cells after they have been activated. It increases the diversity of the antibody's antigen-binding site. It happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer patches. So this could be a possibility.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. Not sure how that relates to the variable gene sequences.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). It occurs after the initial activation and is guided by cytokines. But this doesn't directly cause high variability in the variable regions.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the initial diversity of the B cell receptor. But this happens early on, and each B cell has a unique VDJ rearrangement. However, once they're formed, somatic hypermutation is what leads to further diversification.

So putting it together: the GFP-tagged capsid proteins are likely being taken up by the immune system, perhaps by M cells in the Peyer patches. The B cells in the Peyer patches would then start an immune response. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that the B cells are undergoing hypermutation to generate more diverse antibodies. This process, somatic hypermutation, occurs in the germinal centers where B cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes to improve affinity. So the correct process here is A) somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but why wouldn't it be D? Oh, because D is about initial formation of the BCR, but the question is about after the cells are isolated and showing high variability. That suggests an ongoing process, which is hypermutation after the initial VDJ setup.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some of the GFP-tagged proteins are degraded by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, which suggests a process that increases antibody diversity.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer patches, and increases antibody diversity by introducing mutations in the variable regions of the heavy chain. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to the variability in antibody sequences.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions of the heavy chain.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to create initial diversity. However, the high variability observed in the experiment suggests an ongoing process, such as somatic hypermutation, rather than the initial diversification of VDJ.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after initial VDJ recombination and is responsible for further diversifying antibody sequences in activated B cells. 

Answer: A
