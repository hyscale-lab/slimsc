Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods. System 1 has a period of 2 years, and system 2 has a period of 1 year. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocities are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right, the more massive star moves slower because it's closer to the center of mass. So the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, right. The formula I think is that mass is inversely proportional to velocity. Like, m1/m2 = v2/v1, but maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's laws as well.

Wait, let's think about the mass function. Oh wait, for a spectroscopic binary, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula is something like K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, another approach: In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower. So the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses.

So for system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. Let's say star A has velocity 10 and star B 5. Then, their masses would be in the ratio M_A : M_B = v_B : v_A. So M_A/M_B = 5/10 = 1/2. So M_A is half of M_B. So total mass is M_A + M_B = (1/2) M_B + M_B = (3/2) M_B. So M_total = (3/2) M_B.

Wait, but wait, actually, the mass ratio is (v2/v1). Because the more massive star moves slower. So if star 1 has velocity v1 and star 2 has v2, then M1/M2 = v2 / v1.

So for system_1, v1 =10, v2=5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) M2. So total mass is M1 + M2 = (1/2 +1) M2 = 3/2 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2. Total mass is (2/3 +1) M2 = 5/3 M2.

Wait, but wait, let me get this right. The mass of each star is proportional to the reciprocal of their velocity. So if system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, then M1 is proportional to 5, M2 proportional to 10. So M1 = 5 units, M2=10 units, sum is 15 units.

Wait, no. Because M1 = (v2) / (v1 + v2) * (total mass). Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.

In a binary system, the ratio of the masses M1/M2 = v2 / v1. Because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2 (conservation of momentum; the center of mass is stationary, so M1 v1 = M2 v2 → M1/M2 = v2/v1).

So for system_1, v1 =10, v2=5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1 = (1/2) M2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = (1/2)M2 + M2 = 3/2 M2.

For system_2, v1=15, v2=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2. So total mass = (2/3 +1) M
