Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in this Feynman diagram based on the note my colleague left. The note says "size estimate" followed by this expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll try to think this through.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant, and the overall dimensions of the amplitude can give clues about the number of loops. Also, the power of pi terms can hint at the number of loops because loop integrals often involve factors of pi.

So, let me look at the expression. The factors are alpha cubed, g squared, sqrt(2), 8, and 1 over (4 pi)^6. Also, (Q/M) squared is there, but I guess that's just a ratio of energy scales, maybe for dimensional analysis.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is roughly e^2/(4 pi epsilon_0 hbar c), but in natural units, it's just e^2/(4 pi). So alpha has dimensions of 1/(charge)^2 or something like that, but more importantly, it's a dimensionless coupling.

G is another coupling, perhaps a gauge coupling or something else. So each alpha and g is a dimensionless coupling, I think.

In terms of loop expansions, each loop brings in a factor of the loop momentum integral, which in four dimensions would typically involve a (4 pi)^epsilon factor when doing dimensional regularization, but in practice, for each loop integral, you might see a factor like (4 pi)^{something}.

Wait, no. Wait, when you do loop integrals, you often integrate over loop momenta, and in four dimensions, the integrals can lead to terms involving 4 pi from the angular part. For example, a simple loop integral might lead to a factor like (4 pi)^2, because the integration over solid angle in 4D is 2 pi^2 for the sphere, but I'm not exactly sure. Or perhaps each loop contributes a factor of (4 pi)^something, but the denominator would depend on the number of loops.

Looking at the given expression: 1/(4 pi)^6. So (4 pi) raised to the negative sixth power. Let me think about how that relates to the number of loops.

If each loop contributes a factor of (4 pi)^(something), then the number of loops times that would give the exponent. Let's suppose that each loop contributes a factor of (4 pi)^2 or (4 pi)^something else.

Wait, another approach: The typical expansion in terms of loops. Each loop typically gives a factor of (4 pi)^something from the integration measure. For example, a one-loop diagram would have a term like (4 pi)^2, perhaps from the integral over the loop momentum. Wait, but sometimes the loop integral contributes a factor like (4 pi)^{(4 - d)/2} where d is the dimension, but in 4D, that's (4 pi)^1. So each loop might give a (4 pi) factor.

Wait, but maybe each loop contributes (4 pi)^{2} as a part of the integral. For example, in a one-loop diagram, the integral might involve a factor of 1/(4 pi)^2. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Wait, let me think about the superficial degree of divergence. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, in dimensional regularization, the integral might involve a (4 pi)^epsilon term, where epsilon is (4-d), but perhaps in the end, the loop factors contribute (4 pi)^{loop number} in some way.

Wait, another approach. The number of loops in a Feynman diagram is given by L = E - V + 2 - n, where E is the number of edges, V the vertices, and n the number of external lines. But without seeing the diagram, that's hard
