Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cyclotrons, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy. It goes through two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I remember that cyclotrons use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate particles. The protons move in a circular path, and each time they complete a revolution, they get a push from the electric field. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, maybe it's a type with a varying magnetic field? Or perhaps it's about the timing of the voltage with the proton's motion.

Oh right, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the dees (the D-shaped electrodes) when the electric field is in the right direction. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration.

Wait, but wait: the acceleration frequency might be different in a synchrocyclotron because it's designed to handle particles with varying velocities as they gain energy. Oh right, because in a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, so the frequency is fixed. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time, allowing the frequency to change to maintain resonance as the proton's speed increases.

But I'm not entirely confident about that. Let me think. The key point in cyclotrons is the concept of the cyclotron frequency, which is the frequency at which the particles orbit the center. The formula for cyclotron frequency is f = (qB)/(2πm), where q is charge, B is magnetic field, m mass. But in a synchrocyclotron, B is not constant, so the frequency would change as the proton's velocity increases. Hmm.

But wait, in this problem, the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν(α) is a function of alpha, perhaps the angle or another
