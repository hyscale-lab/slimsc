Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this metric is in two dimensions, right? Because it's using x and y coordinates. And pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? So it's a solution to the Einstein equations in 2D, I think.

First, I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere can be written in different forms. The standard one I think is something like ds² = (dr² + dz²) / (1 + (r²/R²))², where R is the radius of the pseudosphere. But that's in polar coordinates, I believe. Or wait, maybe in terms of other coordinates.

But in this problem, the metric is given in terms of x and y. So it's probably using some isometric embedding or something else. Let me see. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks familiar. Wait, that's similar to the metric for spherical coordinates. Because 4 is like (r²) if the radius is 2, since r²=4. So that denominator is 4 - r², where r² is x²+y².

So the denominator (4 - r²) is similar to the (1 - r²/R²) term in the Schwarzschild metric, but this is a different situation. Hmm. Wait, the metric given here is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

So, if I factor out the denominator, let me write it as:

ds² = (32 (dx² + dy²)) / (4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, so in terms of r, that's 32 (dx² + dy²) / (4 - r²). Hmm.

I think the area element in a 2D metric is sqrt(g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. But since this is diagonal, g_xy=0, so the area element dA is sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy. But here, g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - r²). So the area element would be sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)]^2 ) dx dy = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in 2D, the area element is just the determinant of the metric times dx dy. For a diagonal metric like this, the determinant is the product of the diagonal terms. So det(g) = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32/(4 - r²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a metric diag(A, B), the determinant is A*B, yes. So in this case, A = 32/(4 - r²) and B is the same. So det(g) = (32/(4 -
