Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable with it when coupled to a VLT telescope. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's supposed to have a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for detecting stars. The question says a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

So the key here is figuring out which of the listed stars will achieve this S/N. I think the detectability depends on factors like the star's magnitude, distance from us, and the instrument's sensitivity.

Looking at the options, options a to f are different stars with varying distances and magnitudes. Wait, wait, the absolute V magnitude is given for some. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star appears at 10 parsecs. So the apparent magnitude would depend on their distance.

Wait, the formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. So I can calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star.

ESPRESSO's performance is probably dependent on the apparent brightness, as a brighter star (lower m) would mean more photons and higher S/N. The spectrograph's S/N depends on the exposure time, the star's brightness, and the instrument's efficiency.

I think ESPRESSO's S/N can be estimated based on the star's brightness and exposure time. Let me think about the parameters. I remember that for a spectrograph, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. So higher flux (brighter star) leads to higher S/N.

Wait, the question states that each star is at a certain distance. So for each star, I need to compute their apparent magnitude, then see if the instrument can achieve S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

But how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think there's a way to calculate the expected S/N based on the star's magnitude and exposure time.

I think the formula for S/N per pixel is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time))
