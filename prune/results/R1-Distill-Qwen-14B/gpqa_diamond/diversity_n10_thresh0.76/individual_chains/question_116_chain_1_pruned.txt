Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts by describing Compound A. It has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us about the structure. Let me thinkâ€”those downfield shifts or upfield? Oh wait, 0.9 is upfield, usually indicative of CH3 groups attached to something like CH2.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that there are two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Each triplet would be due to coupling with a neighboring group. If each triplet has 3 H, maybe two CH3 groups each giving a triplet? Wait, wait. Or maybe it's a single triplet integrating to 6H, which would be two equivalent CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3 H, and two of them would be 6. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 group, perhaps. Because a triplet in 1H NMR usually arises from coupling with two equivalent neighboring protons. Like a CH3 adjacent to a CH2.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet would imply each of those Hs is adjacent to a CH2 group with two Hs. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Wait, what's a quartet in NMR? It's when each proton is split by a neighboring group with two protons. So if the quartet integrates to 4H, perhaps there are two CH2 groups each with 2 H. Or maybe a single CH2 group that's split into a quartet? No, wait, a quartet would have each H coupled to two equivalent protons. So perhaps the quartet is a result of two adjacent CH2 groups. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about common structures. A triplet for a CH3 group suggests it's next to a CH2. For example, in an ethyl group. The ethyl group's CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2 with two Hs. But in the NMR, the triplet is for 6H. So that suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. So maybe the structure is something like two ethyl groups attached to something. Or maybe a cyclopropane or some ring structure?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is diethyl ether, but that has more than two signals. No, diethyl ether would have a triplet for the CH2 next to the oxygen. Hmm, but diethyl ether has a quartet for the CH3. Wait, no, diethyl ether structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The CH3 groups are at the end, so their protons would be a triplet because they're next to CH2. So in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet integrating to 6H (each CH3 is 3H, two of them). The CH2 next to the oxygen would be a quartet, because each CH
