Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So each of these compounds needs to be checked for whether they have any such centers.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I have to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. So [1,1'-biphenyl] would have two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. Wait, but what about the nitro groups at 6,6'? Let me think: the structure would have two methyl ester groups at 2 and 2', and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So the positions are 2, 2', 6, 6' on each benzene. Wait, but the rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So each benzene has substituents at 2, 6, and 2' (the other ring's 2). 

Wait, the compound is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, substituents are at 2 on each ring, and 6 and 6' on each. Hmm, so the entire molecule would be symmetrical or not? If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. 

Wait, if the substituents are on both rings, maybe the molecule is symmetrical when you rotate it. Because the substituents are on the same positions on each ring, like 2 and 2', 6 and 6'. So maybe this structure is symmetrical, making it not chiral. But wait, biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non
