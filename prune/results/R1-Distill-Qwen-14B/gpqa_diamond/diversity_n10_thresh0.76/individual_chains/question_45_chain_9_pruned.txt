Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. Four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and each option lists three energies in terms of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²).

Hmm, I remember that in an infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²) * (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which they've written as E multiplied by n squared. So E is actually E_1 because n=1 would give E_1 = E.

But wait, the particles here are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold only one particle, right? But wait, spin comes into play here. Since each particle has spin-1/2, they can have two possible spin states (up or down) for each spatial wavefunction. So in each spatial state (n), there can be two particles—each with the same n but different spins.

So in the well, the spatial wavefunctions are determined by n, and each n can have two particles (with spin up and down). So for four particles, let's see how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. So each particle fills the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Let's think about it step by step.

The ground state (lowest energy) would have the particles filling the lowest available n levels, with each level accommodating two particles due to spin.

Since there are four particles, let's see how they fill up.

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles.

Wait, but 2+2 = 4. So all four particles are in n=1 and n=2 levels.

Wait, but wait a second. Each spatial state (n) can have two particles, so for four particles, we would have two filled n levels. Let me think:

n=1 → 2 particles
n=2 → 2 particles
Total: 4 particles.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait,
