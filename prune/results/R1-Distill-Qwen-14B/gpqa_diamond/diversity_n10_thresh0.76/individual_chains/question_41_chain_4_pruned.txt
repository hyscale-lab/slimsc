Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, I need to figure out the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer.

Wait, wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the beam's propagation. So the beam is moving in the direction the glass is moving, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light inside it is moving relative to the glass.

Normally, when a medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light observed? I remember something about the Doppler effect and relativistic motion. Oh wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, right? But inside a medium, like glass, the speed is v = c/n. But in this case, the medium (glass) is moving, so how does that factor in?

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of reference frames. The glass is a moving
