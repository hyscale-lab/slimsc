Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of an acid, another strong acid, and a strong base. So I think I need to figure out whether the overall solution is acidic, basic, or neutral after they all react together.

First, let me list out what each solution contributes. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see if they react, then find out what's left.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Volume is 400 mL (0.4 L), Molarity 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. Volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), Molarity 0.3 M. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Therefore, moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. Let me calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. So the H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05 moles. Hmm, but when calculating the neutralization, I think I can consider all the H+ from HCl, which is strong, and the weak acid's H+ would be negligible compared to the strong acid and base in this case. Or maybe I should account for all of them. Hmm, perhaps I should consider all H+ sources.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- in the mixture, subtract to find the excess, and then determine the pH based on that.

Wait, let me think. The total volume will be the sum of all the solutions. So 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

So first, let's compute the moles of H+ and OH-.

From CH3COOH: Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. So the moles of H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05. Let's denote this as H_acid. But I'm not sure how to handle this yet. Maybe I can find the total H+ from HCl and the weak acid, then see how much OH- is there.

Wait, but let me try to compute all H+ and OH- contributions and see.

CH3COOH: 0.05 moles, but only partially ionized. So it contributes some H+.

HCl: 0.08 moles, fully ionized. So contributes 0.08 * 1 = 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles of OH-.

So total H+ before reaction is H_acid (from CH3COOH) + 0.08. OH- is 0.18.

But wait, the H_acid may react with the OH- as well. Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will react with all the H+ available.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the net moles of H+ or OH- after all possible neutralizations.

So the HAc (CH3COOH) contributes some H+, but it's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But in the presence of a strong base, maybe it doesn't matter because the strong base will neutralize as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the strong acid and strong base first.

So the strong acids (HCl) contribute 0.08 moles H+.

The strong base (Ba(OH)2) contributes 0.18 moles OH-.

They will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the H+ from HCl will neutralize OH-.

So 0.
