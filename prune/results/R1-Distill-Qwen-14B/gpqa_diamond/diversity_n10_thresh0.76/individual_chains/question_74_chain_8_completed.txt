Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about the probability of an atom decaying. From what I remember, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. So the basic idea is that the probability of decay isn't dependent on the time that has already passed. Oh wait, right! It's memoryless, which means the past doesn't affect the future probability.

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. I think this relates to the decay constant. The formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, t is time, and N(t) is the number remaining.

Wait, but the probability of decay is 32%, which is the fraction that has decayed. So the decay probability P is 1 - N(t)/N0. So P = 1 - e^(-λt). In this case, P is 0.32 when t is 100 minutes.

So let me write that down: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Hmm, solving for λ. Let's rearrange this. e^(-λ *100) = 1 -0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -λ *100. So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, let's compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... I think ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher. Let me see, maybe around -0.3856? Wait, wait, let's get more precise. Let me calculate ln(0.68).

Hmm, 0.68 is e^x. So x is about -0.38566. Let me check: e^(-0.38566) is approximately 0.68. So yes, λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should keep it as ln(0.68) = -100λ, so λ = - [ln(0.68)] / 100. Let's compute that more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can just keep it in terms of λ for now. But let's continue.

The question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're interested in is 150 minutes. But wait, does that mean 150 minutes from the start, or 150 minutes from now? Oh, the question says, "the next 150 minutes," so it's 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start.

So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes is the same as if we just started observing it.

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability from now (t=50) to t=50+150=200 is the same as the probability from t=0 to t=150. Because the exponential decay doesn't depend on when you started.

So, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes would be P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but I can also think of it as the probability that it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes minus the probability it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes. Since P(>200) = e^(-λ*200), and P(>50) = e^(-λ*50). So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is P = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

But wait, another approach: Since 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying within 150 minutes of the current time, which is the same as decaying in 150 minutes from now. Because the decay process is memoryless.

So, the probability is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but let's calculate that.

But first, I need to find λ. So from the initial condition, 32% decayed in 100 minutes.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100), which gives e^(-λ*100) = 0.68.

So, as before, λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 = (ln(1.470588)) / 100.

Wait, no, ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 /100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

So for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150).

Let me calculate that exponent: 0.0038566 *150 = approximately 0.57849.

So e^-0.57849 is about? Let's think. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approximation: e^-0.57849.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ln(0.57) ≈ -0.5621. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to think of a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the value more accurately. 0.57849 is approximately 0.5785. So e^-0.5785.

I know that e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.5785) is a bit less. Let me compute 0.5785 as 0.5 +0.0785.

So e^-0.5785 = e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0785). e^-0.0785 is approximately 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785^2)/2 - ... Let's approximate:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 for small x. So x is -0.0785.

e^-0.0785 ≈ 1 - 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2 /2.

0.0785^2 is about 0.006162. Divided by 2 is 0.003081.

So 1 -0.0785 = 0.9215 + 0.003081 = 0.924581.

Multiply by e^-0.5 (0.6065) → 0.924581 * 0.6065 ≈ let's compute that.

0.9 * 0.6065 = 0.54585.

0.024581 * 0.6065 ≈ approx 0.01491.

So adding up: 0.54585 + 0.01491 ≈ 0.56076.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5608.

So 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392, which is about 43.92% chance.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) 44%, which is 44%.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the problem says that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. So would that affect the calculation?

Wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we just started observing it, regardless of how much time has passed. So the initial calculation is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the total time from the start is 200 minutes, but the probability of decay is P=1 - e^{-λ t} where t is the time since the start. But since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability of decaying in the next 150 is P = [1 - e^{-λ (50+150)}] - [1 - e^{-λ *50} ] = e^{-λ *50} - e^{-λ *200}.

Wait, this is the same as the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. Let's compute that.

We have λ = 0.0038566 per minute.

Compute e^{-50 * λ} = e^{-50 * 0.0038566} = e^{-0.19283}. Let's compute that.

e^-0.19283 ≈ let's see, 0.19283 is about 0.1928. e^-0.19 is approximately 0.8265, e^-0.2 is 0.8187. So 0.1928 is about halfway between 0.19 and 0.2.

Approximating: The difference between 0.19 and 0.2 is 0.01. e^-0.19 ≈ 0.8265, e^-0.2≈0.8187. The difference is about 0.0078 over 0.01 change. So for 0.0028 over 0.19, the decrease would be about (0.0028 / 0.01) * 0.0078 ≈ 0.002184.

So 0.8265 - 0.002184 ≈ 0.8243.

So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8243.

Next, e^(-200 * λ) = e^(-200 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.77132). Let's calculate that.

e^-0.7 is approximately 0.4966. e^-0.77 is about 0.4624.

Wait, more accurately: Let's compute e^-0.77132.

Using calculator-like approximation: e^-0.7 ≈ 0.4966.

e^-0.77 = e^-(0.7 +0.07) = e^-0.7 * e^-0.07. e^-0.07 is approximately 0.9324.

So 0.4966 * 0.9324 ≈ 0.4635.

Alternatively, let me use a Taylor expansion around x=0.7.

But perhaps a better approach is to remember that ln(0.4635) ≈ -0.77.

Wait, but if I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can note that 0.77 is between 0.7 and 0.8.

e^-0.7 is 0.4966, e^-0.8 is approximately 0.4493.

So 0.77 is 0.07 above 0.7. The difference between e^-0.7 and e^-0.8 is about 0.4966 - 0.4493 = 0.0473 over 0.1. So per 0.01, it's about 0.00473.

So for 0.07, that's 0.07 * 0.473 ≈ 0.0331.

Wait, wait, I think I'm complicating this. Anyway, perhaps it's easier to just approximate e^-0.77132 as around 0.46.

So the probability is 0.8243 - 0.46 = 0.3643, which is 36.43%. That's not matching any of the options. Hmm, this is conflicting with my earlier approach.

Wait, this can't be right. Earlier approach gave 43.92%, which is option A (44%) and this new approach is giving 36%, which isn't an option.

Wait, so where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait a second. The initial approach was correct because the decay is memoryless. So the probability after 50 minutes of not decaying doesn't change the fact that the next 150 minutes have the same probability as any other 150-minute period. So the correct answer should be 44%, which is option A.

But let me think again. Because the options don't include 44%, wait, option A is 44%, yes.

Wait, but in my second approach, I calculated the probability between 50 and 200 minutes, which is 150 minutes. And that's 0.8243 - 0.46 = 0.3643, which is about 36.4%. But that's not matching the first approach.

Hmm. So which approach is correct?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the second approach. Because the question is asking for the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So, the conditional probability is P( decay between 50-200 | not decayed before 50) = P( decay in 50-200 ) / P( not decayed before 50 ).

Wait, no, wait. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if the atom has not decayed by 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period from the current time, which is what I calculated earlier as 44%. So the correct approach is the first one, and the second approach is wrong because it's using absolute probabilities, not conditional.

Wait, but perhaps this is a misunderstanding. Let me clarify.

The decay is memoryless, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150). Since the decay rate doesn't depend on the time already elapsed, the 50 minutes not decaying doesn't change the probability for the next 150. So the correct calculation is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Earlier, I found that to be approximately 43.92%, which is 44% (option A).

So why did the second approach give a different answer? Because in the second approach, I tried to compute the absolute probability between 50 and 200, which isn't the same as the conditional probability. Because the conditional probability is given that it hasn't decayed up to 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is just the same as the probability of decaying in a 150-minute period. So the initial approach is correct.

Hence, the correct answer is option A) 44%.


The problem involves calculating the probability that a radioactive atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law and is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in a given time interval depends only on the current time and the decay constant, not on the time already elapsed.

### Key Information:
1. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which corresponds to the fraction of atoms that decay in that time.
2. The decay constant, \( \lambda \), can be determined using the formula:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   where \( P = 0.32 \) and \( t = 100 \). Solving for \( \lambda \), we find:
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{-\ln(1 - P)}{t} = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
   \]

3. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-\lambda t},
   \]
   where \( t = 150 \). Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \), we calculate:
   \[
   \lambda t = 0.0038566 \times 150 \approx 0.57849.
   \]
   Using \( e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5608 \), the probability becomes:
   \[
   P = 1 - 0.5608 \approx 0.4392 \, \text{or} \, 43.92\%.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (44%)**: Matches the calculated probability of approximately 43.92%.
- **Option B (40%)**, **Option C (52%)**, and **Option D (48%)**: Do not match the calculated probability.

### Conclusion:
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, making **Option A** the correct answer.
