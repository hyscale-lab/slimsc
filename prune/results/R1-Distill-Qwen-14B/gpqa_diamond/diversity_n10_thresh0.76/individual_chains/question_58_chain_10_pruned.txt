Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies? The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems because you can't have an infinite result in a physical measurement. Regularization helps to make these infinities manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to control them, and then you can subtract or renormalize them later.

So I need to think about which of these theories don't have such issues, meaning they don't require regularization. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it's supposed to be a more complete theory that doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, particles are not point-like but are extended as strings, which might change how divergences occur. I remember that in string theory, some of the problems with high energies (like the Landau poles in QED) are possibly avoided because it's a different framework. But wait, do they still need regularization? I'm not too sure, maybe not because the theory is background-independent and maybe doesn't have the same divergences in the same way.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I know that QCD does require regularization because it's a quantum field theory that has loop diagrams which can lead to divergences. These need to be handled through renormalization. So QCD definitely requires regularization, so B is not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. It does have divergent loop diagrams, especially in processes like electron self-energy and photon vacuum polarization. Because of these, QED requires regularization methods like introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization. So C isn't the right answer because it does need regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't involve quantum effects, so they don't have issues with renormalization or regularization. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical E&M, you don't have divergences in the same way, or at least not in the same quantum sense. So this theory might not require any regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, in classical E&M, there's the problem of self-energy and the infinite charge of point charges, but those are more philosophical issues and not handled by regularization. In classical theory, you just accept the mathematical results, even if they lead to infinities. So D might be the correct answer because it doesn't require regularization in the quantum sense.

So putting it all together, the
