Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Y, and the products formed. The goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A to D, so I'll need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me read through the problem again to understand all the clues.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. That means the molecule is made of an element where the number of neutrons equals the protons. Wait, wait, the same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. Hmm. So if the molecule is, say, H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps W is a molecule of a diatomic gas where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: elements where protons equal neutrons would be the ones with atomic number equal to their neutron number. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Not equal. Helium: 2 protons, 2 neutrons—so He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So He could be a candidate for W. Or maybe other elements. Wait, but the molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons in each molecule. So each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me clarify: the molecule's composition is such that the total neutrons equals total protons.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says, "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So each molecule has equal total protons and total neutrons. So for example, if it's H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So two Hs would give 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. If it's O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen-16 is the common isotope). So O2 would have 16 protons (8 each × 2), 16 neutrons (8 each ×
