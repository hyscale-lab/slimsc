Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step. 

The question is about genes involved in resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. They did an experiment where they knocked out three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double mutants, so all possible pairs. Then they tested how resistant these mutants are compared to the wild type.

The data they have is the resistance percentages. Let me jot them down:

- g1: 75% of control
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so the control is 100% resistant. When a mutant has a lower percentage, it's more susceptible. So a 0% means they can't resist the pathogen at all.

The question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of these genes is a TF, and it's regulating others.

Looking at the options, the options talk about which is the TF, and whether the others are showing pleiotropy or gene redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A. Like, if you have a double mutant A and B, it might have the same phenotype as A alone. That suggests that A is acting upstream of B, so the pathway is A â†’ B.

So let's think about what each single mutant looks like. 

G2's resistance is 0%, which is the lowest. So in the single knockouts, g2 is the most compromised. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that's necessary for the other genes to function. Because if G2 is knocked out, all downstream genes can't be activated, leading to no resistance.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. But g2 alone is 0%, so the double mutant isn't worse than g2. That would suggest that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if you knock out G2, the function of G1 doesn't matter anymore.

Similarly, g2g3: 0%. Since g2 is already 0%, adding g3 doesn't change it. Again, indicating G2 is upstream of G3.

Now, what about g1g3? Their double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That suggests that maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but perhaps they work in parallel pathways. Or maybe they have additive effects.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then in single mutants, g1 and g3 would have less resistance than wild type. That's what we see: g1 is 75% (so some resistance left), g3 is 50%. So without G2, but with G1 or G3, the plant still has some resistance. 

So, G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, so resistance drops to 0% for g2. But when only G1 is knocked out, G3 is still active, giving some resistance (g1 at 75%). When only G3 is knocked out, G1 is active, giving 50% resistance.

Now, for the double mutants:

g1g2: since G2 is upstream, and G1 is downstream, knocking out both G1 and G2 would have the same effect as just G2 knockout, which is 0% resistance. Which matches the data.

g2g3: same as above, 0%.

g1g3: both are downstream of G2. So without G1 and G3, but G2 is present (since in g1g3, only G1 and G3 are knocked out). Wait, no, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is wild type. So G2 is active, but since both G1 and G3 are gone, the overall resistance is 10%. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and work together, their combined knockout would be worse than either alone.

Wait, but the data says g1g3 is 10% which is
