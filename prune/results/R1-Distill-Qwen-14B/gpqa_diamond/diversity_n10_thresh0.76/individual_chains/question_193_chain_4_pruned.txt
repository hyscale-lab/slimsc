Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. Hmm.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The given information is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are various functions of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I think is that parallax plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, is it d = 1/plx? Yeah, because as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if d is in parsecs, then plx in arcseconds is 1/d.

So the problem says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to d, plx = 1/d. So replacing that, N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe it's the differential number of stars with distance. Like, how many stars are there per unit distance interval. Hmm. Because the way the question is phrased, it's about "per unit range of distance, r."

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dr would be the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by dr. Or, more accurately, the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr.

So N ∝ d^5. So dN/dr would be 5d^4. Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase. If N is proportional to d^5, then N = k d^
