Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about epoxidation of alkenes and subsequent analysis using HPLC. 

So, let me start by recalling what mCPBA does. I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically involves adding an oxygen atom across a double bond to form an epoxide. 

The question involves two reactions: Reaction 1 with (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. So, first, I need to figure out what the products of each reaction are.

Epoxidation of alkenes can result in different stereochemistry depending on the starting geometry. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxidation with mCPBA would form different epoxide products. Wait, but mCPBA is a peracid that adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to the formation of an epoxide without necessarily changing the stereochemistry of the substituents around the double bond. Or does it?

Wait, no. Wait, in epoxidation, the peracid adds across the double bond. The double bond is in a specific geometry, and the epoxide forms with the two new oxygen bonds in a certain way. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Oct-4-ene is a symmetrical molecule. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are CH2CH2CH2 groups. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps I should draw it better. Oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Oh wait, oct-4-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me get the structure correct. 

Octene is C8H16. Oct-4-ene would have the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think in terms of the actual structure. 

Ok, oct-4-ene is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. The formula is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that can't be right because that's all single bonds. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the
