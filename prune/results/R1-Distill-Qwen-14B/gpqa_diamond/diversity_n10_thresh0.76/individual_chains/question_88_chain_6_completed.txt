Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a process that's taking place in the immune system after some observations. Let's see.

The scenario: They tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and give it to mice orally. When they do in vivo imaging, some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, others get stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Then they looked at the fluorescent Peyer's patches, isolated the proliferating cells, and sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

Wait, what's happening here. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens in the gut. So when rotavirus is taken orally, the antigens would be processed there.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. So when the rotavirus is ingested, the stomach acid might break down some parts. That's why some fluorescence is destroyed. Others might have made it through the mucus (like the intestinal mucus) but perhaps didn't reach the lymphoid organs? Or maybe some did reach, like the Peyer's patches.

In Peyer's patches, the antigens are presented to the immune system. There, B cells would take up the antigens and present them via MHC II, leading to T cell activation, and then the B cells would start proliferating. So in the isolation, they took the proliferating cell population—which I think are activated B cells.

High variability in the variable heavy chain genes—that suggests that something is causing the diversity in the B cell receptors. The variable regions of the heavy chains are where the antigen-binding site is, right? So when B cells are activated, they undergo some process that increases diversity.

Wait, the options are about different processes. Let's look at the options.

Option A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially after T cell activation. It's a process where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to more diverse antigen binders. This happens in the germinal centers, which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs.

Option B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, leading to opsonization or direct lysis of pathogens. But I don't think it's directly causing variability in the B cell receptors.

Option C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibodies (like from IgM to IgG), but it's a switch in the constant region, not the variable. So it doesn't create variability in the variable regions themselves.

Option D) VDJ recombination: That's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. But this happens during the initial formation of B cells, not during the immune response. So this would give a diverse initial set, but the question is about high variability found after activation.

So the process happening after the B cells are activated and have started proliferating would be somatic hypermutation. That makes sense because once the B cells are in the germinal centers, they undergo hypermutation to increase diversity, leading to a varied variable region. This allows for a more effective immune response, as different B cells might target different epitopes of the same antigen.

So in the experiment, the high variability in variable heavy chain genes suggests that each B cell has a slightly different receptor, which is the result of somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering it to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some is entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are specialized for antigen sampling in the gut, and when rotavirus is ingested, its antigens are processed there. The GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins likely serve as antigens for B cells, which proliferate in response. High variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases diversity in the B cell receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors after T cell activation, increasing diversity. It occurs in germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs, and fits the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibodies (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chains.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes initial diversity but does not explain the observed variability after activation.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers. This process increases the diversity of B cell receptors, allowing for a more effective immune response.

Answer: A
