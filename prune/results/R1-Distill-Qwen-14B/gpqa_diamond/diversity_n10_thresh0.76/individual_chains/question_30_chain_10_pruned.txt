Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question about dyes and the colors they absorb. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. So the color we see is the one it doesn't absorb; the one it emits is the complementary color of what it absorbs, right?

Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. Actually, I think that when a substance absorbs light, it's because its electrons are excited to a higher energy state. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the energy gap between the states. Then, when it emits light, it's usually at a different wavelength, maybe lower energy because it's going from higher to lower state. But I'm a bit confused about how that relates to the color emitted versus the color absorbed.

So, the energy given here is 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Alternatively, another version is E(eV) = 1240 / λ(nm), right? Because 1240 eV·nm is approximately hc in eV and nm units.

So if E is 2.3393 eV, I can plug that into E = 1240 / λ. Let's calculate λ: λ = 1240 / 2.339
