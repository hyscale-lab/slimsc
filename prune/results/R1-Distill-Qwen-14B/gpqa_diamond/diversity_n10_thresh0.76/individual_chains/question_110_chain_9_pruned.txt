Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. The question is asking which stars can be observed using both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to 16. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude (that's the brightness as seen from Earth) that's less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, actually, the wording is stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed by ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, when it comes to magnitudes, lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than (i.e., magnitude less than) 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag. So the apparent V magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, no, the way it's phrased is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" â€” wait, magnitude scale is inverted. So a brighter star has a lower magnitude. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means the apparent magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V mag must be less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, must be less than 16.

So, a star must be bright enough (apparent V mag <17) for ESPRESSO and even brighter (apparent V mag <16) for HIRES. So, it must be apparent V mag <16, because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So any star that can be detected by HIRES can also be detected by ESPRESSO. But wait, no: because the question is asking for stars that can be detected with both. So a star must be bright enough for both. So,
