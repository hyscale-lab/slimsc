Okay, so I’ve got this question about Maxwell’s equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. And that's related to one of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell’s equations are four in total, right? Let me think about each one. The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field. Oh right, Gauss's law for electricity: the divergence of E is rho over epsilon zero. That one relates to electric charge. So if the universe allows isolated magnetic poles, does that affect this equation?

I think not. Because Gauss's law for E deals with electric charges. Magnetic monopoles would affect the magnetic fields, not directly the electric fields. So maybe that equation stays the same.

The second equation is Faraday's law of induction. It's about the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. I think that equation would still hold because it's about how changing B fields create E fields. So that might not change either.

The third equation is Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of B is zero. In our universe, this is true because magnetic monopoles don't exist. But in this alternate universe, if you can have isolated North or South poles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So that equation would change.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. That's about the curl of H being equal to the time derivative of D plus the current density J. Wait, but if the universe has magnetic monopoles, does that affect Ampère's law? Or maybe the other equations are more directly affected.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, there's another term. I remember that if magnetic charges exist, then both the divergence of B and the curl of E would change. Let me think: normally, div B = 0. If there are magnetic monopoles, div B would be rho_m (like the magnetic charge density) divided by some constant, maybe. So that equation definitely changes.

What about Faraday's law? In our world, it's curl E = -dB/dt. But with magnetic currents, I think the equation might have an extra term. Like, maybe curl E would also have a term involving the magnetic current density or something. Wait, so Faraday's law would change as well.

So which equations are different? Let me list the four equations:

1. div E = rho / epsilon0 (electric Gauss)
2. curl E = -dB/dt (Faraday)
3. div B = 0 (magnetic Gauss)
4. curl H = dD/dt + J (Ampère-Maxwell)

In the scenario of isolated magnetic poles, equation 3 would change because div B would not be zero anymore. Also, equation 2 (Faraday's law) would get an additional term related to the magnetic current.

Wait, I remember that if you have magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So in that case, both electric and magnetic versions of Gauss and Ampère laws apply.

So the modified equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. curl E = - dB/dt - J
