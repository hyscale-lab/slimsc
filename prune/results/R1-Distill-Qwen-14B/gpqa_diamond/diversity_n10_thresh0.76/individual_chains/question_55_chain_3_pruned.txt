Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is. Let's see, the options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans. Hmm. I remember that the structure of these compounds has an ester group, so the acetate part is OAc, and then the propenyl or butenyl group attached.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet).

Wait, the singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group from the acetate. Because in acetates, the OCH3 would typically show up around 2.1 as a singlet, right? So that fits.

Now, the other signals. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J=16 Hz). That's a big coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling. Because when two protons are on adjacent carbons but on opposite sides (trans), they can have larger coupling constants, like in an alkene. So maybe this is a vinyl proton, part of a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets, or perhaps a doublet with some splitting. I'm not exactly sure about the 'dq' notation, but doublet could imply two neighboring protons. Wait, a doublet of quadruplets would mean it's split by two different sets of protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet because of coupling with one proton and a quartet from another. Hmm, not entirely clear, but let's think about the structures.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H. So that's a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 or a CH?

Let me try to draw the structures. The options are about propenyl or butenyl acetates. Let's think about each.

Cis-propenyl acetate would be something like CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, actually propenyl would be CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, propenyl would have three carbons, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, I think I might be mixing up the structures.

Wait, no. Let's think. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but the ester would be OAc attached to the end. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. But wait, the question is about cis or trans. Oh, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that's a three-carbon chain. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc
