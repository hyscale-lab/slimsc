Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be solved by separation of variables or by recognizing them as known systems like harmonic oscillators.

Wait, the potential here has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks familiar. Oh right, that's the potential for a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Let me think, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait no, wait. Let me do that correctly. The original second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, we get (3/2)k r² * (1/2)*(1 + cos2θ) which is (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So expanding that, it's (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

So the entire potential V(r, θ) is the sum of the two terms. So:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, adding the terms: (1/2) + (3/4) = (2/4 +3/4 )=5/4. So,

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, maybe this isn't the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the potential as a sum of terms that can be separated in polar coordinates. Let me write V(r,θ) as:

V(r,
