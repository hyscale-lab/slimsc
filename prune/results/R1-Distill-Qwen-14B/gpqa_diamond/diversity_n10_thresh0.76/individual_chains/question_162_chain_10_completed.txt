Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and in this case, it's probably a 2-dimensional space since there are only two coordinates, x and y. Oh wait, no, wait—pseudosphere usually refers to a 2D surface, but in GR, metrics are often for 4D spacetime. Wait, maybe this is a 2D metric, like a 2-dimensional Lorentzian manifold? Or perhaps it's a static slice in 3D? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere is a term I associate with hyperbolic geometry, but in GR, a pseudosphere can also refer to a surface with negative curvature. Alternatively, a pseudosphere might refer to a 2-sphere with imaginary radius, which would give an infinite area. But wait, the radius given is r=2, which is a positive real number. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). The numerator is 32, so the overall coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So, this looks like a conformal metric, meaning it's a conformally flat spacetime. The line element is conformally related to the flat metric.

In conformal coordinates, the area element is important. The general area element in 2D is dA = (1/g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the coefficient of dx dy in the metric. Wait, but in this metric, it's diagonal, so g_xy = 0. So the area element would be sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But for a diagonal metric, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. Since both terms are multiplied by the same factor, 32/(4 - x² - y^2), the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y^2)]^2. So the square root of that is 32/(4 - x^2 - y^2), and the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but the metric is written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same, and g_xy=0. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Then the square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but I'm trying to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Radius r=2. So maybe the pseudosphere is defined in such a way that the metric corresponds to a sphere with negative radius squared or something like that.

Wait, in Minkowski space, a pseudosphere can refer to a sphere with a timelike radius, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps this metric describes a 2D Anti-de Sitter space or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is that of a sphere with radius related to 4. Wait, let's see: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that suggests that the region where 4 - x² - y² > 0 is allowed, so x² + y² <4. So the spatial coordinates x and y are confined within a circle of radius 2, because 4 is (2)^2. So the spatial region is a disk of radius 2.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this is a way of embedding a pseudosphere in this metric.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should compute the area of the surface defined by this metric. Let's imagine that this is a 2D surface. Then the area would be the integral of the area element over the surface.

But what's the surface? The metric is defined in terms of x and y, which suggests it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space? Or perhaps it's a 2D Lorentzian manifold, which would make it a spacetime, not a sphere.

Wait, but the question asks about the area of the pseudosphere. So perhaps it's a 2-sphere embedded in this metric. Alternatively, maybe the metric itself is that of a pseudosphere.

Wait, another thought: in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given here might have such a property.

Wait, let me compute the Gaussian curvature of this metric. Since it's conformally flat, the curvature can be found using the formula for conformal metrics. I think the Gaussian curvature K for a conformal metric ds² = e^{2f} (dx² + dy²) is given by K = -e^{-2f} [Δf], where Δ is the flat-space Laplacian.

Wait, in our case, the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, e^{2f} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So f = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - x² - y²)) = (1/2)(ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²)).

Then, the Laplacian of f in flat space is the sum of the second derivatives. Let's compute the Laplacian of f. Let me denote u = 4 - x² - y². So u =4 - r², where r² = x² + y².

So f = (1/2)(ln(32) - ln(u)).

The Laplacian of f would be the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y.

First, compute the first partial derivatives:

df/dx = (1/2) * (- ( -2x ) / u ) ) = (1/2) * (2x/u) ) = x/(u).

Similarly, df/dy = y/(u).

Second derivatives:

d²f/dx² = [ (u * 1 ) - x*( ( -2x ) ) ] / u² = [u + 2x² ] / u².

Similarly, d²f/dy² = [u + 2y² ] / u².

So the Laplacian Δf = (d²f/dx²) + (d²f/dy²) = [ (u + 2x²) + (u + 2y²) ] / u² = [ 2u + 2(x² + y²) ) ] / u².

But x² + y² = 4 - u, so substituting:

[ 2u + 2(4 - u) ] / u² = [2u +8 - 2u ] / u² = 8 / u².

So Δf =8/(u²) = 8/( (4 - x² - y²)^2 ).

Then, the Gaussian curvature K is -e^{-2f} Δf.

e^{-2f} = 1/ e^{2f} = (4 - x² - y²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - x² - y²)/32 ] * [8/(4 - x² - y²)^2 ].

Simplify:

(4 - x² - y²) cancels out, leaving:

K = - (8) / (32 (4 - x² - y²)) ) → K = -1/(4 (4 - x² - y²)).

Hmm, so the Gaussian curvature is negative, which is consistent with a pseudosphere (which has constant negative curvature), but in this case, it's not constant—it depends on x and y. So perhaps the metric describes a surface with varying negative curvature, which complicates things.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the pseudosphere in this metric is a coordinate sphere, like x² + y² = (2)^2 =4. But wait, looking at the denominator in the metric, 4 - x² - y² would become zero when x² + y² =4. So the metric would have a singularity at the boundary of this disk. So the area enclosed by x² + y² =4 would be problematic because the metric blows up there.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere is the entire spatial part described by the metric. Wait, but the metric is defined on the disk x² + y² <4. So the area would be the integral over this disk of the area element.

So the area A is the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Let me change to polar coordinates, since the integrand is radially symmetric. x² + y² = r², so r goes from 0 to 2 (since 4 is 2^2). The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. So:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The integral becomes:

A = 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r dr ] / (4 - r²).

Let me substitute u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr. So 32 r dr = 32 * (-du/2) = -16 du.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr] / (4 - r²) = ∫ (-16) / u du.

Which is -16 ln |u| + C.

Substituting back, u=4 - r². So:

∫ from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2, u=4 -4=0.

Wait, wait, this is a problem. Because when r approaches 2, u approaches zero, and ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-16)/u du.

Which is (-16) * [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] = (-16)( (-infty) - ln4 ) → which is (-16)( -infty ) → positive infinity. So the integral diverges. Thus, the area A is infinite.

Wait, so the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

But let me double-check. The area element is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ. As r approaches 2 from below, the denominator approaches zero, so the integrand blows up. So the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

So the answer should be D) +infty.


The metric provided is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D conformally flat spacetime. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute this, we first note that the metric is defined for \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) becomes singular when \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \). This suggests that the spatial region is confined within a disk of radius 2.

The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor. For a diagonal metric, the determinant is the product of the diagonal components. Here, the determinant is:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Switching to polar coordinates (\( r, \theta \)), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), which gives \( du = -2r \, dr \) or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), leading to:

\[
-16 \left( \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right) = -16 \left( -\infty - \ln(4) \right) = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the integral diverges, and the total area is infinite. This result is consistent with the fact that the metric becomes singular at \( r = 2 \), causing the area to diverge near the boundary.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D) \( +\infty \)**.
