Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. Then, each product is formed through specific reactions, and finally, we're supposed to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are from A to D, with numbers 6, 8, 10, or 7.

Alright, let me break down each reaction step by step. I'll start by writing down what each step does.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.

Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone. When ketones react with bromine, what happens? I remember that bromine can add to carbonyl groups. Oh right! It's a bromination reaction. The ketone group (C=O) would react with Br2. So, cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Adding bromine would probably lead to a dibromide. How?

Ah, right. Cyclohexanone has the structure (CH2)5CO. When Br2 is added, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen is attacked by a bromide ion, but wait, Br2 is a dienophile? Or perhaps it's an addition across the carbonyl. Wait, no, more accurately, in a ketone's case, bromine can add to the carbonyl group via a mechanism where Br adds to the carbonyl carbon and the other Br to the oxygen, but wait, that might be more like for esters or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxybromide formation.

Wait, another thought: I'm a bit confused. When a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's likely undergoing a ketone bromination. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder type reaction, but wait, cyclohexanone isn't a diene. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the reaction of cyclohexanone with Br2 under certain conditions. Oh, right! I think that when ketones react with bromine, particularly in a protic solvent, they can form a bromohydrin. But wait, in the case of cyc
