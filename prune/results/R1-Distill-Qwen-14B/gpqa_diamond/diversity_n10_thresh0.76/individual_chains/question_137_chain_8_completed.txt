Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators, but synchrocyclotrons are a type of them, right? I think they use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate particles. 

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on synchrocyclotrons. I remember that in cyclotrons, the particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field that's applied in a way that synchronizes with their motion. Synchrocyclotrons are like more advanced versions, maybe handling relativistic speeds better. 

The voltage given here is time-dependent, oscillating. So the acceleration isn't constant, which makes sense because in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction as the particles circle around. 

The key here is probably relating the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of revolutions. Since the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, all its energy comes from the work done by the electric field over multiple revolutions. 

I think the kinetic energy (T) of the proton is related to the number of revolutions (N) it makes in the synchrocyclotron. The energy per revolution would be the voltage multiplied by some factor, maybe the charge of the proton.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t), but in each acceleration, the proton gets a kick from this electric field. The energy added each time depends on the voltage. Since it's a time-varying voltage, the effective voltage might be the average or perhaps the peak value.

The proton goes through two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Oh wait, two accelerations? So perhaps each acceleration happens once per revolution? Or each time it goes around, it gets a certain energy boost.

Wait, no, the problem states it undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe that's not directly relevant. Let me read the question again. Oh, the voltage is applied, and the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, perhaps each time it goes through the electric field, it gains energy once. So maybe each revolution corresponds to one acceleration? Or two? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in cyclotrons, each time the particle goes around, it passes through the electric field twice (because the field alternates direction as the particle's velocity changes direction). So maybe each revolution gives two energy kicks. But wait, in the question, the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps each acceleration is a single energy addition. Maybe each acceleration happens once per something.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton makes a certain number of revolutions. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the basic equations for cyclotrons. The cyclotron frequency is given by ν = (qB)/(2πm). The time for one revolution is T = 2πm/(qB). But in a synchrocyclotron, especially when dealing with high energies where relativistic effects are significant, the mass increases, so the frequency changes. But wait, the problem gives us U(t) as a function of time, but with ν(α), which probably accounts for the relativistic changes. But I don't think I need to get into the details of that for this problem.

The kinetic energy gained by the proton is related to the number of times it's accelerated. Each acceleration event adds some energy. The total energy is 950 MeV, so if I can find how much each acceleration gives, I can find the number of accelerations, which may correspond to the number of revolutions.

The voltage U(t) has a peak value U0 = 190 kV. Since the proton has charge e, each time it goes through the potential difference, it gains energy e*U. But wait, the voltage is alternating, so it's maximum value is U0. So each time it goes through, it might gain e*U0 each half-cycle or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, the voltage is applied as a cosine, so the maximum voltage is 190 kV. The energy gained per revolution would be e times the voltage. But how does the phase Φ0 affect this?

Alternatively, maybe the average voltage matters, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the kinetic energy gained per revolution is e * U0, because the maximum potential difference is U0. Since each revolution corresponds to one acceleration, the number of revolutions N would be approximately T / (e * U0), where T is the total kinetic energy.

Wait, but the total kinetic energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 eV. Because each acceleration gives e * U0 (190,000 eV) energy.

Wait, so N = T / (e * U0) = (950e3 eV) / (190e3 eV) ) = 5. So that's 5. But wait, that's way smaller than the options given. So that can't be right.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Because the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. Wait, no, the question says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV." Oh wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The actual wording is "A proton is injected ... undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." So the two accelerations are the steps the proton goes through. So perhaps each acceleration step brings the proton to a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps each time it goes through the electric field, it gets a certain energy boost. Let me think again. The voltage is applied, and each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains energy based on the voltage.

In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the electric field, it gains energy e * U. The maximum energy is when the voltage is maximum, so maybe each time it's e * U0.

But since the voltage is sinusoidal, the effective energy transfer per revolution might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the effective energy per revolution is (e * U0)/2, because it's the average over a full cycle.

Wait, but the question gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν α t + Φ0). So the maximum is U0. So each time the proton goes through the accelerating gap, it gains e * U0. But how many times does it do that to reach 950 MeV?

Wait, the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 eV. Each acceleration gives e*U0, which is 190,000 eV. So the number of accelerations N is (950,000) / (190,000) = 5. So, 5 accelerations. But the question is asking for the number of revolutions. 

Wait, in a cyclotron, each revolution corresponds to one acceleration. Because each revolution brings the particle around the magnetic field once, and during that time, the electric field has changed phase. So each revolution, the proton goes through one acceleration. So 5 revolutions.

But wait, the options don't have 5. The options are all in the thousands. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is much higher. Because in reality, a cyclotron's maximum energy is given by E_max = (e U0) N, where N is the number of times the particle goes through the electric field. But wait, wait, maybe each revolution corresponds to two accelerations because the electric field is applied twice per revolution? Or maybe each time the proton goes through a gap, that's one acceleration. But in a standard cyclotron, each revolution includes two acceleration events because the electric field alternates direction as the particle's velocity changes direction. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. In a cyclotron, the magnetic field causes the particle to move in a circular path. The electric field is applied across the gaps in the dees. The electric field alternates direction each half-period, so each time the particle passes through the gap, it gets a kick in the direction of the field. So each full revolution (which takes time T) consists of two acceleration events. Because as the particle moves clockwise, then counter-clockwise, each time it passes through the gap once per half-revolution.

Wait, so each revolution includes two acceleration steps. So if each acceleration step gives e * U0, then each revolution gives 2 * e * U0 energy. Then the number of revolutions N would be T_total / (2 e U0).

Wait, in that case, T_total is 950,000 eV. Each revolution gives 2 * 190,000 eV = 380,000 eV. So N = 950,000 / 380,000 ≈ 2.5. But again, that's not matching any options, and it's way too small.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the point about the phase and the number of times the proton is accelerated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about cyclotron steps but about how the frequency of the accelerating voltage relates to the particle's motion.

Wait, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is given as ν(α), which I think is the frequency at which the voltage oscillates. In a cyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage has to match the cyclotron frequency for the particles to be accelerated efficiently. So ν(α) is probably the cyclotron frequency, which depends on the relativistic mass. But in this problem, perhaps we can ignore the details of ν(α) because it's given.

Wait, the number of revolutions would be related to the time the proton spends in the accelerator. But how?

The time taken to reach 950 MeV would be the number of revolutions multiplied by the time per revolution. But the time per revolution depends on the magnetic field and the energy of the proton, which is increasing as it gains kinetic energy. So this might get complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think about the energy per revolution. The problem states that each time the proton goes through the accelerating voltage, it gains e*U0. But how many times does it go through this?

Wait, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so T ≈ 0. Then after two accelerations, it reaches 950 MeV. Wait, the problem says it undergoes two accelerations, but wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

"A proton is injected ... undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV." So perhaps the two accelerations are the steps needed. So each acceleration gives some energy, and the total is 950 MeV.

Wait, but that would mean two accelerations, each giving 950/2 = 475 MeV. But the voltage is 190 kV, which is 190,000 eV. So 190,000 * e per acceleration. Wait, but 475,000 eV is much larger than 190,000. That doesn't add up. So I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the two accelerations refer to the process of going through the synchrocyclotron twice. Each time, the proton gains energy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is related to the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. Let's think about the energy per revolution.

Each time the proton makes a full revolution, it's accelerated once. So each revolution contributes e * U0 energy. So the total number of revolutions N would be T / (e U0).

But T is 950 MeV, which is 950,000,000 eV. U0 is 190,000 eV. So N = 950,000,000 / 190,000 ≈ 5000 revolutions. Looking at the options, option B is 5300, option C is 3536, and so on. So 5000 is close to option B, which is 5300. Hmm.

Wait, but why is it 950 MeV instead of 950,000 eV? Oh, wait, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. So 950 MeV is 950e6 eV. Oh, right, I messed that up earlier.

So let's recalculate. N = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) ) = (950e6) / (190e3) = (950 / 190) * (1e6 / 1e3) )= 5 * 1000 = 5000. So N=5000. So the answer would be approximately 5000, but looking at the options, none is exactly 5000. The closest is option B (5300) and option C (3536). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. In a synchrocyclotron, each revolution doesn't just give e*U0 energy because of the way the electric field is applied. Alternatively, perhaps it's the peak voltage that's applied each half-cycle. Let me think again about how the energy is added.

In a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction every half-period. So each time the particle goes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So each revolution consists of two acceleration events. So each revolution adds 2 * e * U0 energy.

Wait, but that would change the calculation. So if each revolution gives 2 * e * U0, then the number of revolutions N would be 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 950e6 / 380e3 = (950 / 380) * 1e3 = (2.5) * 1e3 = 2500. So N=2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. So that's a possibility.

But why would each revolution give two accelerations? Let me think. The cyclotron has two D-shaped electrodes. The electric field alternates direction each time the particle passes through the gap. So for each full revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice, each time getting an acceleration. So each revolution gives two accelerations.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1. So perhaps each revolution gives two accelerations. So to get 950 MeV, how many accelerations are needed?

Each acceleration gives e*U0. So total accelerations N_a = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000. But each revolution gives two accelerations, so the number of revolutions N = N_a / 2 = 5000 / 2 = 2500.

Ah! That makes sense. So the total number of revolutions would be 2500. So the correct answer is D) 2500.

Wait, but why does the phase Φ0 come into play here? The problem gives Φ0 as π/4. I didn't use that in the calculation. That's concerning. Did I miss something?

Alternatively, perhaps the phase affects the timing of when the proton is accelerated, but not the total number of revolutions. Or perhaps it's a red herring in the problem, as the number of revolutions depends only on the energy gained and the voltage. Since the problem gives the phase, but it doesn't affect the number of revolutions, perhaps it's irrelevant here.

So the answer would be D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the relationship between the proton's kinetic energy and the energy gained per revolution. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The accelerating voltage is given as \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy \( e \cdot U_0 \) during each acceleration event. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, the proton passes through the electric field twice per revolution, corresponding to two acceleration events per revolution. Thus, the energy gained per revolution is \( 2 \cdot e \cdot U_0 \).

The total number of revolutions \( N \) can be calculated by dividing the total kinetic energy \( T_1 \) by the energy gained per revolution:

\[
N = \frac{T_1}{2 \cdot e \cdot U_0}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \),
- \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV} \),

we get:

\[
N = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{2 \cdot 190 \times 10^3} = \frac{950}{380} \times 10^3 = 2.5 \times 10^3 = 2500.
\]

Thus, the proton makes \( 2500 \) revolutions. The phase \( \Phi_0 \) does not affect the number of revolutions, as it only influences the timing of the acceleration events.
