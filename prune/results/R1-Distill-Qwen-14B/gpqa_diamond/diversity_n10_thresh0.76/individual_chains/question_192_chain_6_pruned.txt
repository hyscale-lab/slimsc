Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's going on.

So, the setup is a spherical conductor with radius R. Inside this conductor, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because it's inside the conductor. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity.

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so the options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a charge is inside a conducting shell, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces get induced charges. But wait, wait, no. In this case, the conductor itself is uncharged. So the initial conductor is neutral. So when we place a charge inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, but wait another thing. The conductor itself is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. If we place a charge +q inside the cavity, which is surrounded by a conductor, then the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out.

But wait, the conductor is a spherical shell, right? No, wait, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity inside. Hmm, maybe I should model this. So, the setup is similar to having a hollow conducting sphere, but the cavity is offset from the center, not concentric. Oh, that's probably important.

Wait, the conductor is a solid sphere with a cavity. The cavity is not at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor, and s is probably a non-zero value. So the cavity is shifted within the conductor.

So, when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface (cavity's inner wall) will have
