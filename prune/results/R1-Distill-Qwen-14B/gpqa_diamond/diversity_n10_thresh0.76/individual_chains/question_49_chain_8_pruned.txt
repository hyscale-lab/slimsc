Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and trying to figure out each reaction one by one.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a different reaction. I need to match them with the options provided. Let's tackle each reaction separately.

Starting with Reaction A:
The reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Hmm, so that's like an ethanamine where both hydrogens on the nitrogen are replaced by methoxy groups. So the structure would be CH2N(OCH3)2, I think. Then, the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2OHCH2CH3? No, wait, butenol. Let me clarify: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but wait, the double bond is between C3 and C2. Oh wait, for but-3-en-2-ol, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2, but that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. Let me draw it:

But-3-en-2-ol: positions 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4? Wait, but that's not possible for a four-carbon chain, because the double bond between C3 and C4 would make it but-1-ene. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Oh, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that can't be right. Alternatively
