Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity is spherical too, with radius r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and r is less than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Got it.

Now, some positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Oh, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, but now has some charge inside the cavity, I think the charges will redistribute. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor must induce some charges.

Oh right, when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to it. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged. So the inner cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. But what about the outer surface? Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor's net charge is zero. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge remains zero. So, the inner surface has -q, outer surface +q.

But then, for a point outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field should be due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Wait, point P is outside the conductor, so the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor. The total charge enclosed would be the sum of the inner and outer charges. But wait, the inner charge is -q, and the outer is +q. So total is zero. That would imply E is zero, but that's not matching any of the options except maybe some other considerations. Hmm, but wait, wait a second. Am I missing something?

Wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. The charge +q is placed inside the cavity, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. So the total charge inside any Gaussian surface outside the conductor is the sum of the conductor's charges. Let me see: the conductor's own charge is zero, but the inner and outer surface charges are -q and +q. So the total enclosed charge is (from the conductor) zero plus the charge inside the cavity, which is +q. Wait, no, the conductor's inner surface has -q. So when you take a Gaussian surface outside the conductor, the total charge inside is the conductor's own charge (which is zero) plus any enclosed charges. But the conductor's own charge is zero, so the Gaussian surface would include the charge inside the cavity, which is +q. Oh wait, no, wait. The conductor's inner surface has -q. So the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose the total charge +q (from the outer surface) and the inner -q but since the conductor's total is zero, the Gaussian surface would have a net charge of +q? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So when you're outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses all the charge inside, which is the conductor's charge (zero) plus the charge inside the cavity, which is +q. Because the conductor's inner surface is -q, that's part of the conductor, so it's included in the conductor's total charge. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges on the inner and outer surface are what matter. The inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So for a point outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface charge, which is +q. Because the inner surface's charge is inside the conductor's material, so the field outside is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. So the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / r², where Q_enclosed is the charge outside the conductor. Which in this case is the outer surface's +q.

Wait, but the conductor's Gaussian surface outside would have a charge of +q. So P is outside the conductor, so the electric field would be as if all the +q is at the center of the conductor. So the distance from P to the center is L. So E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Hmm, looking at the options, option B says that. So that's the electric field.

But wait, what about the position of the cavity's center? Because the charge is placed at a point inside the cavity, which is offset from the center of the conductor. So the field at point P would depend on the position of the charge, but wait, no. Because once the charge is inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface adjusts to have the induced charge. So the electric field outside the conductor is due to the charges on the outer surface, which are symmetric. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, the outer surface's charge distribution remains symmetric. So the field outside depends only on the total charge of the outer surface, which is +q.

Wait, but wait, if the charge inside the cavity is placed asymmetrically, would that affect the outer surface's charge distribution? No, because the conductor is a sphere. The outer surface must remain symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. The inner surface's charge distribution would be different because of the position of the cavity's center, but the outer surface's charge would still be uniformly distributed.

Wait, but in this problem, the point P is outside the conductor, and the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field at P due to the outer surface is as if all the +q is at the center of the conductor. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center to P. So that would match option B.

Wait, but let's think about the setup again. The cavity's center is shifted by a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at distance l from the cavity's center, with an angle theta between l and s. Would that affect anything? Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's Gaussian surface would include all its charges, which are zero. But the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface is -q, and outer is +q. So the field outside is due to the +q on the outer surface. So regardless of where the +q is inside the cavity, the outer surface distributes as a uniform shell. So the field outside would be as if +q is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, in the problem, the charge is placed inside the cavity, but the cavity's center is off the conductor's center by s. So the charge's position relative to the conductor's center is s plus the position within the cavity. But in any case, the conductor's induced charges would still make the field outside depend only on the total outer charge, which is +q.

So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the setup. Because the point P's position is given with reference to the cavity's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the distance from the conductor's center to the cavity's center is s. So the distance from P to the conductor's center is L, which is sqrt(s² + l² - 2 s l cosθ), perhaps? But in the problem statement, L is given as the distance from the conductor's center to P, so L is known.

But in any case, the electric field outside the conductor is due to the outer charge, which is +q, and the field depends only on the distance from the conductor's center, which is L.

So the correct expression is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D says E is proportional to 1/l². That would be if the field was due to the charge inside the cavity, but since P is outside the conductor, the field is due to the conductor's charge, so D is incorrect.

Option A has (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. Option C has (l + s cosθ)^2. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, perhaps if the charge were inside a non-conducting shell, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface is +q, so the field is as if it's a point charge at the center. So regardless of where the cavity is, the field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center, so the position of the cavity doesn't affect the external field, only the external charge distribution.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conductor Properties**: Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the inner surface of the conductor (at the cavity's surface) will have an induced charge of $-q$ due to the presence of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a point outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. The conductor's net charge is zero, but the outer surface of the conductor has a charge of $+q$. The field outside the conductor is due to this $+q$, which is uniformly distributed on the outer surface of the conductor.

3. **Symmetry Considerations**: The position of the charge $+q$ inside the cavity (and the offset $s$ of the cavity's center) does not affect the symmetry of the outer surface charge distribution. The field outside the conductor is as if all the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Distance to Point $P$**: The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$. Therefore, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ suggests a dependence on the relative positions of $P$, the cavity's center, and the conductor's center. However, the field outside the conductor depends only on $L$, not $l$ or $s$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The field outside the conductor is due to the $+q$ on the outer surface, and the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$ is $L$.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant to the field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the field is proportional to $1/l^2$, this would only be valid if $P$ were inside the conductor or interacting directly with the charge inside the cavity, which is not the case here.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The correct expression is:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]
