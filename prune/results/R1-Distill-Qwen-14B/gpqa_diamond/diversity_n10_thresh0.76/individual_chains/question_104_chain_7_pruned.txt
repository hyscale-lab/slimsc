Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think. 

Alright, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data points given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines of their host stars. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star moving towards or away from us. So a larger shift would mean a higher velocity. 

The formula I think is connected to this is the one involving the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, I remember that the RV shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which in turn depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, no, let's get back. The RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is given by ( (2Ï€ G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/ something? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula, but maybe it's better to think about the relation between the velocity and the orbital period.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is higher when the planet's mass is larger, or when the orbital period is shorter. Because a planet with a shorter period would cause more frequent and larger velocity shifts, right? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, actually, the formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something) )
