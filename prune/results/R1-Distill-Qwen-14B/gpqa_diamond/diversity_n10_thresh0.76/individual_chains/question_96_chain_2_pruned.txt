Okay, so I've got this problem here about a supermassive black hole and finding the order of magnitude of its entropy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that entropy for a black hole is related to its area somehow. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula! It says that the entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon divided by the Planck area.

Wait, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * k_B, where A is the area, l_p is the Planck length, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But maybe for order of magnitude calculations, the constants can be approximated or even ignored because we're focusing on the powers of ten.

First, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius, R_s. The Schwarzschild radius is given by R_s = (2 G M) / (c^2), where M is the mass of the black hole. But maybe I can find R_s another way using the angular size provided.

The problem gives the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, right, the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance, when θ is very small. So θ ≈ R_s / d.

Wait, let me think about units. Oh yeah, θ should be in radians. The given θ is 1e-17 degrees. I need to convert that to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 * (π/180). But since 1e-17 is such a tiny number, maybe I can approximate this as θ ≈ 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ (3e-19) radians. Wait, because pi is about 3.14, so 3e-19 is roughly right.

Wait, let me calculate it more precisely. 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π/180) radians. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416/180 is about 0.01745 radians per degree. So 1e-17 degrees is 0.01745e-17 radians, which is 1.745e-19 radians. Close enough, but for order of magnitude, maybe 1e-19 is sufficient? Hmm, but perhaps I should just proceed with the exact expression without approximating yet.

Anyway, R_s = θ * d. So R_s = θ * d. But wait, no, θ is the angular size, so R_s = d * θ. So if θ is small, R_s ≈ d * θ.

But wait, wait. The actual formula is θ (in radians) = R_s / d, so R_s = θ * d. So that's correct.

So R_s is equal to θ multiplied by d
