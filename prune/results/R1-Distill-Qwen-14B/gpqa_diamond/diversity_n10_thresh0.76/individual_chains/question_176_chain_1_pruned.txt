Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second, those are three elements. Oh, right, so it's a 3x1 column vector. That makes sense since the matrices for operators P and Q are 3x3. So the system is in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space.

The operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them down to visualize better.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, the question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the order is measure P first, then Q. So I need to find the probability that the first measurement of P gives 0 and the subsequent measurement of Q gives -1.

But wait, quantum mechanics measurements can affect the state of the system. So when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So after measuring P, the system's state will be in an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q in that new state will give a different outcome.

So the approach should be:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the state will collapse into one of the eigenvectors of P, and the probability is determined by the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

2. For each possible eigenvalue of P (like 0), find the corresponding eigenvectors. Then, compute the probability of collapsing into that eigenvector.

3.
