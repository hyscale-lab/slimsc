Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The question is about how the star's brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet. We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm. So, the setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness. These changes can look similar to the dimming caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star. The question is asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would the planet's radius need to be to cause the same brightness variation.

I remember that the light curve's amplitude depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star. For an exoplanet, the change in brightness is the area of the planet divided by the area of the star. But I think this might also involve the temperature because the spots are cooler, so they contribute less light when facing us.

Wait, the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spot side moves towards and away from us. The dark spots would absorb less light, so when they are on the side facing us, the total brightness would dip. But their lower temperature would mean they emit less light.

Wait, no. When a spot is on the near side (facing Earth), it's blocking part of the star's surface. So the star emits less light because a cooler part is facing us. So the brightness variation is due to the star's surface being partly covered by these cooler spots.

But how does this compare to an exoplanet? An exoplanet causing a transit would block some starlight, so the dip depends on the planet's area over the star's area. So the key is to find the equivalent size of the planet that would cause the same dip.

Wait, but the star's spots are not just a single spot; they cover a filling factor of 20% of the hemisphere. So, perhaps the total area of the spots is 2
