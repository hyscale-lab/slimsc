Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows something called an exponential decay law. But wait, how exactly does that work? Let me think.

The question says that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So, if I have an atom, there's a 32% chance it'll decay in that 100-minute window. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, what's the chance it'll decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, 150 minutes after what? Oh, wait, I think it's 150 minutes from the current time, which is 50 minutes in. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But does that matter? Or is it the next 150 minutes from now?

Wait, no, the question says 150 minutes after the existing 50 minutes. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. But I'm a bit confused about how the probabilities work here.

I remember that in radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of the time elapsed so far. Like, it's memoryless. So whether the atom has been around for 50 minutes or 5, doesn't change its probability of decaying in the next period. So the probability for the next 150 minutes should be based on the same decay constant, but multiplied by the time.

Wait, but the given probability is for 100 minutes. So maybe I should find the decay constant first. Let's recall the formula. The probability of decay P is 1 minus the exponential of (-λt), right? So P = 1 - e^(-λt). Or wait, no, wait. The decay equation is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining, N0 initial. So the probability of decay is 1 - N(t)/N0 = 1 - e^(-λt).

So given that P=0.32 at t=100 minutes, we can find λ. Then, using that λ, find the probability for t=150 minutes, but wait, no, because 50 minutes have passed already. Oh wait, no, if 50 minutes have passed
