Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The compounds are A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. The problem describes some reactions and properties of these compounds, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me break down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oxidation state percentages might be tricky. Alternatively, oF could stand for something else, but I'm more familiar with oxidation states. So oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, maybe that's the percentage composition by mass of fluorine in A2?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The notation is a bit unclear. Maybe ɷF stands for the oxidation state of F in A2? But oxidation states are typically integers. 31.96% sounds more like a percentage composition, like mass percent. So, in A2, fluorine makes up 31.96% by mass.

So, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2 when heated at 293 K.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so this suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

A3 can also interact with xenon. So A3 is another compound that can oxidize xenon, probably a weaker oxidizing agent than A1.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So Y is the other element in A3. So Y is combined with fluorine to form A3. So A3 is YF something.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5.
