Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate which one it is.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, a rhombohedron is a three-dimensional figure formed by six congruent rhombi. In crystallography, the rhombohedral system is one of the seven crystal systems. It's similar to a cube but with all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So, in this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I'm guessing that refers to the edge length, a, of the rhombohedral unit cell. So a = 10 Å.

The interplanar distance, d, for a given set of Miller indices (hkl) is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(θ) ), where θ is the angle between the edges? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit different.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times the structure factor. But for a rhombohedral system where all a, b, c are equal (a=b=c=a0, maybe) and the angles are equal (α=β=γ=θ), the formula simplifies.

I remember the formula for d_{hkl} when the lattice is rhombohedral is:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ]

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. No, wait, the general formula for d_{h
