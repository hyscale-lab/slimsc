Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when a certain time passes in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So that means we can probably use special relativity here. Because when frames are inertial, special relativity applies.

The given data is that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed. But I need to find the distance the ejecta travels from the Galaxy's point of view after some time.

Wait, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So the time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I remember that time dilation comes into play when you switch frames. Because moving clocks run slower in other frames.

So, when the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, each frame will perceive the other's time differently. Oh, right! The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) happen at the same place. But wait, in this case, the events are the start and end of the journey... but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait a second. Let me think. In the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow.

Wait, no. Wait, the direction of motion is towards each other. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, which is moving towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame. So the relative speed is 60,000 km/s.

But wait, the speed is given as 60,000 km/s. That's a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh, because the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that, which is significant but not extremely relativistic.

So, I need to account for time dilation. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is related to the time in the eject
