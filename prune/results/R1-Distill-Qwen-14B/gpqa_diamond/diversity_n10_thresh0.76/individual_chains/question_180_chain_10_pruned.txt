Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, we've got 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge, which is 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And the question is about the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, so the 13th charge is at P, and the others are 2 meters away from P. Oh, right, so the 12 charges are each 2m away from P. So the setup is that one charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all located at 2 meters from P.

Wait, but what's the configuration of those 12 charges? Are they all at the same point 2m from P, or are they spread out in some way? The question says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe they can move around, but always stay 2 meters away? Hmm, but for the purpose of calculating potential energy, perhaps we can consider them as being placed at a distance of 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other could affect the potential energy of the system.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we just need to find the total potential energy. The system consists of the 13 charges. So the potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

But wait, the charges are identical and have the same sign, so they repel each other. So the potential energy will be positive, and the minimum energy would be the configuration where the potential energy is the least (since for like charges, the potential energy is higher when they are closer together, but here the configuration is fixed except for the 12 charges being constrained to 2m from P. Wait, but the problem says each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the distance between the 12 charges could vary, but the problem might be considering that they are all at a fixed distance from P, but perhaps they can be arranged in any way as long as they're 2m from P
