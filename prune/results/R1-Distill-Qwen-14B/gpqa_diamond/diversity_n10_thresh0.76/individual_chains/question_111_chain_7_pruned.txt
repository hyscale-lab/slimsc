Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts: reactions A and B, and I need to choose the major products from the options given.

First Reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) --> Product A

Second Reaction: 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O --> Product B

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The structure of cyclohexanone derivatives can be a bit confusing, but let me try to draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have ethyl and methyl groups, respectively. Wait, no, wait: the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So positions 2 and 6 each have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So position 2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl? No, wait: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (so two substituents), and position 6 has a methyl. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numbering: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. That can't be right because that would imply position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl. Alternatively, maybe 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Or maybe I'm misreading it. Let me re-express the structure.

The IUPAC name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone (position 1 ketone) ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and another methyl group (since 2,6-dimethyl; no, wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would mean that position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl. Wait, is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one the same as 2-(ethyl)(methylcyclohexanone at 1), but wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at carbon 1. Carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and also 2,6-dimethyl). So position 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. Position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ket
