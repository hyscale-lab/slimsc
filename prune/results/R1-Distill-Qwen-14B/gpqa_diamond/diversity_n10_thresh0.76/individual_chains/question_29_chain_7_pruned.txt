Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in this barley cultivar. Let me break this down.

First, the problem says that the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. So, the gene is split into exons, which are the coding regions, and introns, which are non-coding and spliced out. The anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene, so if we mutate the gene to stop making the compound, that's what we want.

The question is about EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations—usually substitutions of a single nucleotide. So each mutant probably has a point mutation somewhere in the gene.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the intact gene, I see that in the first part: the intact is TTTCTCGCT, and mutant 1 has TTCTACGCT. So, let me count the letters. Wait, the first seven letters of the intact are ATGTTTC. Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are.

Wait, the target gene's sequence is given, and the mutants show changes in the first exon area. Since exons are the parts that are expressed, any mutations there could affect the protein.

The sequence comparison:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC
So let me line this up.

Intact: positions 1-20 maybe? Let's see:

Intact starts ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to compare each segment.

Looking at the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to count the nucleotides.

Wait, let me look at the initial part:

Intact: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: 5' ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so the first part is ATG followed by three Ts (TTT) for the intact, but in Mutant1, the next three are TTC. So that's a change from TTT to TTC.

Wait, but what's the exact change? Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
