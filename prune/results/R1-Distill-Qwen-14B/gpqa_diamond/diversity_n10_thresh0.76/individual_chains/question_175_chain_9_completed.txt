Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that accelerating charges radiate energy, and this is a case about an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with its symmetry along the z-axis.

The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of wavelength λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees and the form of the function f(λ, θ).

Wait, I think this relates to the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something similar. Because oscillating charges can be modeled as dipoles when they're oscillating. Oh right, a dipole radiator has a radiation pattern that depends on the angle θ.

The radiation from a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the dipole. So, in this case, the dipole is along the z-axis, so the maximum radiation is in the xy-plane, which is θ=90 degrees. But wait, the problem is asking about θ=30 degrees, which is less than 90, so it's somewhere between the equator and the poles.

Wait, the radiation pattern for an ideal dipole is given by the formula P is proportional to (sinθ)^2, right? So the power per unit solid angle, which is the radiation intensity, is proportional to sin²θ. That makes sense because at θ=0 (along the dipole axis), sinθ is zero, so no radiation. And at θ=90, sinθ is 1, so maximum radiation.

So if the maximum power is A, that would correspond to θ=90 degrees. So the function f(λ, θ) would have a maximum at θ=90. But wait, the question says in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is f of λ and θ. So f should be a function that peaks at θ=90 and falls off elsewhere.

Now, considering the problem's specifics: the oscillating charge distribution is spheroidal. Wait, a spheroid is like an ellipsoid, but maybe it's a prolate spheroid? Or an oblate one? But I think the radiation pattern for a dipole would still be similar, with the maximum in the equatorial plane.

Wait, but the question is about the form of f. The function could have a dependence on λ as well. For an oscillating charge, the radiation would have a wavelength related to the oscillation frequency. The power radiated is also dependent on the square of the acceleration or the charge's oscillation parameters.

In terms of radiation, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is given by the Larmor formula. The average power is ( (e^2 a^2 )/(6πε₀ c^3) ), where a is the acceleration. But in this case, since it's oscillating, the acceleration a is related to the angular frequency ω, which is linked to the wavelength λ through c=λ f, and since f = ω/(2π), so ω = 2π c / λ.

But how does this tie into the function f? The power per unit solid angle would depend on the radiation pattern. So the total power is A, and the function f(θ) must integrate over all solid angles to give A. So the maximum at θ=90 would be when sinθ is 1, so f is proportional to sin²θ, but scaled by some factor involving λ.

Wait, but the question also asks about the dependence on λ. The options suggest that f has a λ factor, like λ^-4 or something. So the function f would have a form that includes λ dependence.

Wait, the radiation from an oscillating dipole is also dependent on the polarization. But in the far field, the radiated electric field has a component that is transverse and depends on the dipole's orientation. But perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

So, for the function f, the power per unit solid angle would be proportional to (something involving λ) multiplied by sin²θ. Wait, but the Larmor formula's power is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which in turn is proportional to (ω²), since a = d²x/dt² = -ω² x. So a² is ω^4, so the power is proportional to ω^4. Since ω is 2π c / λ, that makes ω^4 proportional to λ^-4.

So the total power A is proportional to λ^-4. Now, since the function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, if the total power is A, then the intensity at any point (θ) is A multiplied by the fraction given by the radiation pattern.

So the function f would be proportional to λ^-4 times sin²θ. But wait, let's think: the power per solid angle (intensity) is f(λ,θ) = (some constant) * (sinθ)^2 * λ^-4.

Wait, but the function f is f(λ,θ). So in the options, the function f is given as something multiplied by a λ factor. So for example, option A is λ^-4. So the function f would be (something) * λ^-4 multiplied by sin²θ.

But wait, the maximum power A is the total power radiated, which would be the integral over all solid angles of f(θ) dΩ. The integral of sinθ dθ dφ over 0 to π and 0 to 2π would give 4π. But the function f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ, so the integral of sin²θ over the sphere would be 2π, because ∫0^π sin²θ dθ = π. So each point contributes sin²θ, and the integral is 2π. So the total power A is (some constant) * λ^-4 * 2π.

But the maximum intensity at θ=90 is sin²θ=1, so f_max = (constant) * λ^-4. But A is the total power, which is (f_max) * 2π (because ∫ f dΩ = f_max * ∫ sinθ dθ dφ over the sphere. Wait, no: Wait, f is the intensity, so dP = f dΩ, so P = ∫ f dΩ. If f = k λ^-4 sin²θ, then P = k λ^-4 ∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ. The ∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ from 0 to π is ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π. Let me compute that integral: ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3. Because sin^3θ = (1 - cos²θ) sinθ, substitution u=cosθ, du=-sinθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫ (1 - u²) du from 1 to -1, which is [u - u^3/3] from -1 to 1. Let's compute: (1 - (1/3)) - (-1 - (-1/3)) )= (2/3) - ( -1 + 1/3 )= (2/3) - (-2/3) = 4/3.

So the integral of sin^3θ dθ is 4/3. So the total power A is k λ^-4 * (4/3) * ∫ dφ from 0 to 2π. The ∫ dφ is 2π. So A = k λ^-4 * (4/3) * 2π = k λ^-4 * 8π/3.

But the question says the maximum power radiated is A. So the maximum f is at θ=90, which is f_max = k λ^-4 * (sin^2 90) = k λ^-4. So, A = (8π/3) k λ^-4. Therefore, k λ^-4 = (3 A)/(8 π). 

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me rephrase. For the function f(λ,θ) = (some factor) * λ^-4 sin²θ. The maximum f is when sinθ=1, so f_max = (factor) * λ^-4. The total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles: A = ∫ f dΩ. Substituting, A = ∫ (factor λ^-4 sin²θ) sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over φ is 2π, as before. The integral over θ is ∫0^π sin^3θ dθ = 4/3. So A = factor λ^-4 * 2π * (4/3) = factor λ^-4 * (8π/3).

But the maximum f is f_max = factor λ^-4. So f_max = (3 A)/(8 π) ) * 8 π/3 )? Wait, no. Let me see: factor λ^-4 = f_max.

Wait, A = factor λ^-4 * (8 π / 3).

So factor λ^-4 = (3 A) / (8 π).

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe the point is that the maximum occurs at θ=90, and the fraction at θ=30 is (sin^2 30) / (max sin^2θ), because the maximum is at θ=90.

Wait, yes! Because the function f is proportional to sin²θ. So the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 would be (sin²30)/(sin²90) ) = ( (1/2)^2 ) / 1 = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but in that case, the fraction would be 1/4, so the fraction of A at θ=30 is 1/4 of A. But wait, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30", would that be 1/4? Because the intensity is 1/4 of the maximum, but the power at that angle is f(θ) dΩ, which is (1/4 A) * (dΩ), but wait, no. Because A is the total power, which is the integral of f over all dΩ. So f_max is A_max. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things.

Wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle (intensity) is A, or is A the total power? Let me reread the question.

The question says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees and a possible form of f are, respectively".

Oh wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. Wait, no: the problem says the maximum power radiated is A. Wait, no, the question says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. No, wait, no. It says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A": that would be the maximum power, but the maximum power per unit solid angle (intensity) would be higher. Because, for example, the maximum intensity is when the power is concentrated into a single direction.

Wait, no, the question says: "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ, along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30°..."

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So A is the maximum value of f. Because f is the power per unit solid angle. So f_max = A.

But that can't be right, because the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So if f_max is A, then the total power would be the integral of f over all angles, which would be higher than A. But the question says that the maximum power is A. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the maximum power radiated is A, meaning the maximum of the total power. But that can't be, because the question says "radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So f is the power per unit solid angle.

Wait, maybe the maximum of f is A. So f_max = A. So the function f peaks at θ=90°, and at that point, it's A. So the total power is the integral of f dΩ. So the total power would be ∫ f dΩ = ∫ A sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ. Because f is proportional to sin²θ, so f= A sin²θ. Wait, no, because the maximum is A, so f = A (sinθ)^2.

Wait, no. Because if f is the intensity (power per unit solid angle), and at the maximum (θ=90), f= A. So f = A (sinθ)^2. Because at θ=90, sinθ=1, so f= A. Then, the total power is ∫ f dΩ = A ∫ sin²θ sinθ dΩ. Wait, but dΩ is sinθ dθ dφ, so ∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ = ∫ (sin^3θ) dθ ∫ dφ. The integral over φ is 2π. The integral of sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3, as calculated before. So total power P = A * (4/3) * 2π = (8π/3) A.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power radiated is A. So that would be the maximum of the function f. So the total power is (8π/3) A, which is much larger than A. But the question says the maximum power is A. So I'm getting confused about what A refers to.

Alternatively, perhaps A is the total power, and the maximum f is the maximum per unit solid angle. Then, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ times some function of λ. Let me try that approach.

If the total power is A, then A = ∫ f dΩ. If f = k λ^n sin²θ, then A = k λ^n ∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ. So A = k λ^n * (4/3) * 2π = k λ^n (8π/3). So k λ^n = (3 A)/(8 π).

The maximum value of f occurs at θ=90°, so f_max = k λ^n * 1 = (3 A)/(8 π) ) * (1/λ^(-n))? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f has a form that's proportional to (sinθ)^2 times λ^{-4}, as I thought earlier. Because the power depends on λ^{-4}. So f = C λ^{-4} sin²θ.

In that case, the maximum f is C λ^{-4} (at θ=90), which is the maximum power per solid angle. So the total power A is ∫ f dΩ = C λ^{-4} ∫ sin²θ sinθ dθ dφ = C λ^{-4} * (8π/3) ).

So A = (8π/3) C λ^{-4}.

The question says the maximum power is A. So the maximum of f is A. But f at θ=90 is C λ^{-4} = A.

Therefore, C λ^{-4} = A. So C = A λ^4.

But then the total power would be A λ^4 * λ^{-4} * (8π/3) ) = A (8π/3).

Wait, that can't be because the maximum power is A, but the total power is larger. I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should approach it differently. The function f(θ,λ) is the intensity, which is the power per unit solid angle. The function is proportional to sin²θ and to λ^{-4}.

So f = k λ^{-4} sin²θ.

The total power is ∫ f dΩ = ∫ (k λ^{-4} sin²θ) sinθ dθ dφ = k λ^{-4} ∫ sin^3θ dθ ∫ dφ.

The integral over φ is 2π, and the integral of sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3. So total power is P = k λ^{-4} * (4/3) * 2π = (8π/3) k λ^{-4}.

But the maximum intensity is at θ=90, so f_max = k λ^{-4} (1^2) = k λ^{-4}.

The problem states that the maximum power thus radiated is A. So A = f_max = k λ^{-4}.

So, k λ^{-4}=A. So k = A λ^4.

Substituting back into the total power P: P = (8π/3) * A λ^4 * λ^{-4} = (8π/3) A.

But the problem doesn't mention anything about the total power being A. It says the maximum power is A. So I think I've mixed up what A is. Maybe A is the maximum of the intensity, so A = k λ^{-4}.

Then the total power is (8π/3) k λ^{-4} = (8π/3) A.

But the problem doesn't specify what A is. It says the maximum power is A. So perhaps A is the maximum intensity.

Wait, the question says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So the maximum intensity is A, meaning f_max = A.

So in that case, the total power is (8π/3) A.

But the question is asking for the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees. Wait, but A is the maximum intensity, so the intensity at θ=30 is f(30) = A * sin²(30) = A*(1/2)^2 = A/4.

So the intensity at θ=30 is A/4. So the fraction of the maximum intensity is (A/4) / A = 1/4.

But the question says the fraction of A that will be radiated at θ=30. Wait, but A is the maximum intensity. So the power per unit solid angle at θ=30 is A/4, so the fraction of the maximum is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, the function f would be f(λ,θ) = A (sinθ)^2 / (something), but wait, earlier we saw that the function f is proportional to λ^-4.

Wait, no: earlier, we had f = k λ^{-4} sin²θ, and k λ^{-4} = A. So f = A sin²θ. But that's only if the maximum value is A. So in this case, the function f is A sin²θ. So the form of f is proportional to sin²θ, but in terms of λ, since we determined that f is proportional to λ^{-4}.

Wait, no—the function f is given as f(λ, θ), and the function is a function of λ and θ. So we have f(λ, θ) = [something involving λ] * sin²θ.

As per the earlier analysis, f is proportional to λ^{-4} multiplied by sin²θ. So the form is f ~ λ^{-4} sin²θ.

So the function f has a dependence of λ^{-4}.

So looking at the options, the function forms are:

Option A: λ^-4.

Option B: λ^-3.

Option C: λ^-4.

Option D: λ^-6.

So the function form is either A or C.

Now, we have the fraction of A as 1/4, and the function form is λ^-4.

Looking at the options, option C has 1/4 and λ^-4. Option A has 1/2 and λ^-4.

Wait, but the function form is f = (something) * λ^-4 sin^2θ. So the function f depends on λ^-4. So the form is λ^-4 multiplied by a function of θ.

So the options that have λ^-4 are options A, C. So the correct function form is λ^-4, and the fraction is 1/4. So looking at the options, option C has 1/4 and λ^-4.

So the answers would be 1/4 and λ^-4, which is option C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The maximum power radiated is given as \( A \), and the task is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   The radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). At \( \theta = 90^\circ \), the radiation is maximum, and at \( \theta = 0^\circ \), it is zero. The intensity at any angle \( \theta \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power at \( \theta = 30^\circ \)**:  
   At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \). Since the maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \)), the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

3. **Dependence on \( \lambda \)**:  
   The radiated power is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). This arises because the power radiated by an oscillating charge is proportional to the square of the acceleration, which scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \) (since \( \omega^4 \propto \lambda^{-4} \)).

4. **Function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \)**:  
   The function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \). This matches the form \( \lambda^{-4} \), as given in the options.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \)  
  The fraction \( 1/2 \) is incorrect, as the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

- **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \)  
  The fraction \( 1/4 \) is correct, but the dependence \( \lambda^{-3} \) is incorrect; the correct dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

- **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \)  
  Both the fraction \( 1/4 \) and the dependence \( \lambda^{-4} \) are correct.

- **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \)  
  The fraction \( 3/4 \) is incorrect, and the dependence \( \lambda^{-6} \) is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it provides the correct fraction \( 1/4 \) and the correct dependence \( \lambda^{-4} \).

Answer: C
