Okay, so I have this question about planets and their transits. Hmm, the goal is to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should observe that one first. 

Alright, the question says both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are interesting. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would evolved stars have the same radius? Oh, maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something, but same size as the main-sequence star of Planet_1. Well, that's a bit confusing, but for the calculation, I guess the radii are the same.

The probability of a planet transiting depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. I remember that the probability (P) is related to the size of the planet's orbital distance compared to the star's radius, and the inclination. But wait, the exact formula... I think it's something like P = (R_star) / (a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) * (something else? Maybe considering the orbital plane's alignment.)

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since Earth-like planets have much smaller radii than stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So we can approximate P ≈ (R_star / a).

But wait, another thought: the probability also depends on the inclination of the planet's orbit. For a transit to happen, the orbit must be edge-on. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit would cause a transit to the total possible area. Wait, maybe that's a different way of thinking. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P = (R_s / a)²? No, wait, that's not correct. Oh, wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R_s / a) because it's a geometric probability. The planet has to pass directly in front of the star, so the chance is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance (in the plane of the sky) the planet can be from that line.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_* + R_p) / a

Assuming R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

But I think I might have it wrong. Wait, another approach: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned within a certain angle of our line of sight. The probability is proportional to (R_* / a) because that's the maximum angle (in terms of distance from the star's plane) for which a
