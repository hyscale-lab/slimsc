Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X, which is lithium with 3 neutrons, is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The options given are A) 18.475 GeV, B) 23.069 GeV, C) 20.132 GeV, D) 21.419 GeV. I think the correct answer is one of these, but I'm not exactly sure which one. 

Hmm, so first, I need to remember the basic concepts here. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider accelerates heavy ions to a certain speed, and the question is about finding the energy required for a specific speed. I know that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use relativistic mechanics, so classical formulas won't cut it here.

Let me think about the nucleus X. It's defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So each nucleus has a mass of about 6 atomic mass units (u), right? But wait, the exact mass might be needed for precise calculations. I should probably look up the atomic mass of lithium-6, but maybe I can approximate it. Wait, the problem says 'the precision of the energy is at 1e-4,' so I need to be precise, but for now, maybe I can proceed with the approximate mass.

The speed given is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I should use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So the formula
