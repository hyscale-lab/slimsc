Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me read it again.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ here represents the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each of which are 2x2 matrices. 

Wait, so σ · n would be the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. That would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

I think the eigenvalues of a matrix like σ · n might depend on that. Oh wait, I remember something about eigenvalues of Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a linear combination like a·σ, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues would probably be something scaled by the magnitude of a, right?

Wait, more generally, if you have a matrix that's a sum of scaled Pauli matrices, like (a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z), the eigenvalues should be ±|a|, where |a| is the magnitude of the vector a. Because each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are ±1 each. When multiplied by a coefficient, the eigenvalues would scale accordingly. So if the vector a has magnitude |a|, then the eigenvalues of the matrix a·σ are ±|a|.

In this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε times (σ · n). Since n is a unit vector, σ · n has a magnitude of 1, because n is a unit vector. So let me compute the eigenvalues. Let me think: If vector a is (ε, 0, 0), then the eigenvalues would be ±ε, right? Because |a|=ε. So more generally, the eigenvalues would be plus and minus the magnitude of the vector a. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator is H = ε (σ · n).
