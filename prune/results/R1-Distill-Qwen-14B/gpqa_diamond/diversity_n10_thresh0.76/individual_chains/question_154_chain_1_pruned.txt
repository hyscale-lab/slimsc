Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question gives me spectral data for an unknown compound and I have to choose between four options. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest, 100%. There's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. That makes me think there's a chlorine in the molecule because Cl has an atomic mass around 35.5. So the molecular formula likely includes Cl. The molecular weight is 156. Let me calculate possible molecular formulas. 

Wait, molecular weight is 156. If I consider Cl, which is about 35, so 156 - 35 = 121. Then, what's 121 in terms of possible structures? Maybe a benzene ring with some substituents. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see, that's chloro, hydroxy, and aldehyde groups on benzene. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight. Carbon is 12*7=84, H is 5=5, Cl=35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding up: 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Close enough, considering rounding. So molecular weight about 156.5, which matches the 156 peak. But the other peak is at 158, which is 2 more. That could be Cl-35 and one Cl-37, so the M+2 peak would be about 32%, which is typical for Cl. So that's consistent.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight as option A, 156.5. But wait, benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group. So the IR would show a broad peak from the -OH of the acid. The NMR would have the -OH as a broad peak, but in the 1H NMR given, there's a singlet at 11 ppm. That's a strong deshielded proton. For benzoic acid, the -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the singlet at 11 is sharp, maybe indicating something else. Wait, but in the IR, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. A carboxylic acid usually has a peak around 1700 cm^-1, but the carbonyl in an acid might be a bit lower, depending on the environment. Or maybe it's an ester or amide. Wait, 1720 is a bit higher than a typical carboxylic acid. Maybe it's an ester
