Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I don't know if that detail is relevant for solving the problem. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses, and I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's. All have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth.

The given ratios are:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is ~1.4. So T1/T2 ≈ 1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4.
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 is ~2.3. So T2/T3 ≈ 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3.

Mass ratios:
- M1/M2 ≈ 1.15 → M2 = M1 / 1.15.
- M2/M3 ≈ 1.35 → M3 = M2 / 1.35 → substituting M2 from above, M3 = (M1 / 1.15) / 1.35 = M1 / (1.15 * 1.35). Let me calculate that. 1.15 * 1.35 is 1.5525. So M3 ≈ M1 / 1.5525 ≈ 0.644 M1. So M3 is about 0.644 times M1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if mass is needed for this problem. Because the question is about orbital period. Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the star's mass. Hmm, maybe I can relate the planets' temperatures to their distances from the star, and then use that to find the periods.

So, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L*(1 - A))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, A is albedo, D is the distance, and σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all planets have the same albedo, and the star's luminosity is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures will be related to the inverse square of their orbital distances. 

Wait, because T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) → so T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) → T ∝ 1/D^(0.5). So T is proportional to 1 over the square root of D. So, if T1 / T2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(0.5) = 1/1.4 → D2/D1 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.51. So D2 ≈ 0.51 D1.

Similarly, for T2/T3=2.3 → (D3/D2)^(0.5) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈5.29. So D3 ≈5.29 D2.

But D2 is about 0.51 D1. So D3 =5.29 * 0.51 D1 ≈2.708 D1. So the distance of Planet3 is about 2.7 times that of Planet1.

Now, using Kepler's third law: P² ∝ (D³)/(M) → but wait, Kepler's law for a planet orbiting a star is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * D³. But if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which I think is the case, then M + m ≈ M, the star's mass, which is constant for all planets. So P² ∝ D³ / M. So, the ratio of P3 to P1 would be sqrt( (D3³ / M3) / (D1³ / M1) ) ) = sqrt( (D3³ * M1) / (D1³ * M3) ) )

Wait, because (P3² / P1²) = (D3³ / M3) / (D1³ / M1) ) → so sqrt( (D3³ * M1) / (D1³ * M3) ) )

From earlier, D3 is about 2.7 D1 → D3/D1 ≈ 2.7, so D3³/D1³ ≈ (2.7)^3 = 19.683.

And M3 is about 0.644 M1, so M1/M3 ≈ 1 / 0.644 ≈1.552.

So multiplying them: 19.683 * 1.552 ≈ let's compute that. 19.683 *1.5 is about 29.5245, 19.683 *0.052≈ 1.024. So total approx 30.548.

So (P3/P1)² = 30.548 → so P3/P1 = sqrt(30.548) ≈5.527 ≈5.5.

Wait, that's about 5.5 times. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~4.4 or option A) ~10.4, or other.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, D3 is 2.7 D1. So D3/D1 is 2.7. So (D3/D1)^3 = 19.683.

M1/M3 is approx 1.552.

So (D3^3 * M1) / (D1^3 * M3) = 19.683 * 1.552 ≈ 30.55.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(30.55) ≈ 5.527, which is about 5.5.

But none of the options is 5.5. The options are A: ~10.4, B: ~3.2, C: ~4.4, D: ~33.4.

Hmm, maybe I messed up a step. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio for M3 wrong. Let me recheck the mass ratios.

M1/M2 is 1.15 → M2 = M1 /1.15.

M2/M3 is 1.35 → M3 = M2 /1.35 = (M1/1.15)/1.35 = M1/(1.15 *1.35).

Calculating 1.15 *1.35: 1.15 *1 = 1.15, 1.15 *0.35 = 0.4025 → total 1.5525.

So M3 = M1 / 1.5525 ≈ 0.644 M1.

Wait, but in Kepler's law, the mass in the denominator is the mass of the star, right? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is P² = (4π² G M_star)^(-1) * D^3 (M_planet + M_star). But when M_planet << M_star, it's approx (4π² G M_star)^(-1) D^3.

Wait, but wait, Kepler's third law states that P² is proportional to (D³)/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about the star's mass. Hmm. So unless all planets are orbiting the same star, but the question doesn't state that. Wait, but in reality, for a system of three planets, they all orbit the same star. So the star's mass would be the same for all. So M in Kepler's law is the same for all three planets.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I used M3 as the planet's mass, which is incorrect. Ohhh! Oh wait, no. In the formula P² = (4π²/(G(M_star + M_planet))) * D^3. Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the M in the formula is the mass of the star, which is same for all planets. Therefore, when I compute P3/P1, the M in the denominator is the same (the star's mass), so it cancels out.

Wait, wait. Let me see. Let me restate Kepler's law correctly.

The correct formula is P² = (4π² G M_star)^(-1) * D^3 (M_planet + M_star) ≈ (4π² G M_star)^(-1) * D^3 * M_star → so P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * D^3.

Wait, no. Wait, let me get the exact expression. Kepler's third law in the context of planets orbiting a star (with M >> planet mass) is:

P² = (4π² G M_star )^(-1) * D^
