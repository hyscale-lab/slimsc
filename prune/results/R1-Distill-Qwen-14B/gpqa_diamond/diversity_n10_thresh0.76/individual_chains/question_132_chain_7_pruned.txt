Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question involves a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options involve different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

First, I'll think about the molecular formula. C10H14. For benzene derivatives, the formula for a mono-substituted benzene is C7H8, so if we have a di-substituted, it's C8H10, tri-substituted is C9H12, and tetra-substituted would be C10H14. Oh, wait, but the molecular formula here is C10H14 for each compound because each is a tetramethylbenzene. Or wait, no, because the mixture has two aromatic compounds each being C10H14? Wait, no. Wait, the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14, right? Because the mixture is 1:1, so the total would have C20H28, but I don't think that's relevant here. Each compound is C10H14.

So each is a tetramethylbenzene, so four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Except for option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, diethyl would be two ethyl groups, so each ethyl is (CH2CH3), so two of them would add 2*(2 carbons) = 4 carbons. The benzene is 6 carbons, so 6+4=10. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14. So all the options are correct in terms of molecular formula.

Now, the NMR spectrum: two singlets around 6.7 ppm. Each aromatic protons would give signals, but if the structure is symmetric, the protons might be equivalent and give fewer signals.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has two singlets in a 1:1 area ratio.
