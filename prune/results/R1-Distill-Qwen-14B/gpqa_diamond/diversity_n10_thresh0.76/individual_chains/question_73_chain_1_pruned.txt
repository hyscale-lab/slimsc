Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Wait, but when dealing with relativity, I remember that velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So, first, I need to find the relative speed between them. Let me recall the formula. The relative speed v_rel between two objects moving at velocities u and v, as seen from the rest frame, is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, wait. Actually, the formula depends on the frame of reference. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I should subtract their speeds, but considering the relativistic effects.

Wait, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or is it the other way around? Actually, the question asks for the relative speed, but I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So probably, it's the speed of B relative to A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the difference in their speeds in the same frame, but that's not correct because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. So I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction. So if object A is moving at u relative to the rest frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the rest frame, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Wait, or is it (u - v)? Wait, let me double-check. The formula for u' (velocity of object B in A's frame) is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), assuming A is moving at u relative to the rest frame and B is moving at v (same direction). So if u is A's speed and v is B's speed, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/c²).

Wait, let me get the formula right. The velocity of B from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). So in our case, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c, but wait, no. Wait, wait, no: if the rest frame sees A moving at 0.6c, and B moving at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get the sign right. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, B is moving in the negative direction. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute the numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.14286 c. The negative sign indicates direction. So the magnitude is 0.143c approximately.

Wait, but the options have 0.14c as option C and D. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, but in the opposite direction. But the question just asks
