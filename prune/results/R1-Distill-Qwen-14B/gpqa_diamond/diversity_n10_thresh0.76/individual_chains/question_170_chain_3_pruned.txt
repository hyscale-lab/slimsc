Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the operator and the state vector. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector. So the state vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. Oh wait, or is it (3i,4), so first component is 3i, second is 4. Right, that's how spin states are usually represented.

The operator for spin along y is given as σ_y, which is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Right, that's the Pauli Y matrix. So, to find the expectation value of S_y, I need to compute χ† σ_y χ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

Wait, let me make sure I remember how expectation values work. The expectation value <S_y> is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again. So <S_y> = χ† σ_y χ.

First, I need to compute χ†. The state χ is a column vector (3i,4), so the conjugate transpose would be a row vector [ -3 , 4i ], because the conjugate of 3i is -3 (wait, no, wait
