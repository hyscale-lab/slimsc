Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think this is a Yukawa-type interaction because it involves a scalar field (X) coupling to fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

So, the first thing I remember is that for a boson like X to decay into fermions, the energy provided by the boson's rest mass must be enough to create the fermion-antifermion pair. That is, the mass of the boson should be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since each fermion gets half the energy, right? Or maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and the invariant mass).

Wait, but in particle physics, the mass of the boson needs to be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion for the decay to be possible. Because the fermion and antifermion each need some energy to exist. So the minimal case is when both have zero momentum, but their rest masses add up.

But wait, the fermions have rest masses themselves. So
