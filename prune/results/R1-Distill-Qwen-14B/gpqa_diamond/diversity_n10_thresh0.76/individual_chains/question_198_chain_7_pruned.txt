Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution, and the stability constants of their complexes. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Alright, so first, I need to recall what stability constants are. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure how stable a complex is. A higher β (beta) value means the complex is more stable because it requires a higher concentration of products to dissociate.

The problem gives me four stability constants for different complexes. Let me jot them down: β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, and β4 is 16. Wait, so that's for the Co(SCN) complexes? I think they correspond to different numbers of thiocyanate ligands attached. Like, maybe β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, and so on up to β4 for Co(SCN)4. But wait, the question mentions blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, so that's the Co(SCN)2 complex. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ species is the one we're interested in.

The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M. Wait, that's the total concentration of all cobalt species, right? So [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^2- + [Co(SCN)4]^3- = 1e-2 M. And the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. So [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

I think the way to approach this is using the concept of log K and the distribution of metal complexes. The general idea is to calculate the fraction of the Co^2+ that forms each complex and then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (which is the second one in this case, with β2=40).

But wait, the stability constants are given in order—so β1 is for the first complex (monothiocyanato
