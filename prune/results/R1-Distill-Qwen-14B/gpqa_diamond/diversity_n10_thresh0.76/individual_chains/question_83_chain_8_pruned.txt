Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titration and pH. Hmm, let's see. The question says that we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute solutions, you can use the formula C1V1 = C2V2. So the initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³.

Calculating the new concentration: C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2. So that's (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's compute that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. But for concentration calculations, this is just its initial concentration after dilution.

Next step is the titration with NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's find the volume of NaOH needed for that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity is 0.025 M, volume 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So moles NaOH needed is same as moles acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and equivalence point.

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Let me think about both scenarios: the 25% point and the equivalence point.

First, the 25% titration point. At this point, half of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and half remains. Because NaOH is a strong base, it will react with the weak acid as follows: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So when 25% of the equivalence volume is added, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added is 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. So it's neutralizing 0.00025 mol of acetic acid. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. So remaining acid is 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is about 1.85 x 10^-5, so pKa is around 4.735 (since 1e-5 is pH 5, and 1.85 is a bit higher, so about 4.73 or 4.74).

So plugging into the equation: pH = 4.735 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258. So approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A's first pH is 4.26, but let's see the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The sodium ions are spectator ions, so the pH depends on the hydrolysis of CH3COO^-.

The concentration of acetate comes from 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in the total solution volume, which is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (A^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is very small, so the hydrolysis is minimal, and we can approximate.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial: [A^-] = 0.02, [HA]=0, [OH^-]=0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: [A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[HA] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

Kb = x² / (0.02) = 5.405e-10.

Solving for x: x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, the concentration at equivalence point is 0.001 mol in 0.05 L (50 cm³), which is 0.02 M, correct.
