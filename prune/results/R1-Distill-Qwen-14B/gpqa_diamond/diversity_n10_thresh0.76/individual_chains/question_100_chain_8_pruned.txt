Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each part does.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or propane. Wait, propane's formula is C3H8, so A must be propene, which is C3H6. Propene is an alkene, right? So when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, I think that's an addition reaction. Propene would add bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane. That would be compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH would likely form propene again? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, would lose HBr twice. So first, maybe it forms 1-bromopropane, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent bromines. When you eliminate twice, you might form propene again, but wait, perhaps it's a different product. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclopropane? No, that would require a different structure. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding bromine (Br2) would add across the double bond, so it becomes CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you add bromine, it's an anti addition, so it would become CH2Br-CHBrCH3. So structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When bromine adds, each Br adds to opposite ends of the double bond. So it's CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CH2BrCH3? Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no. For propene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the addition would give Br on adjacent carbons. So structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, we'll have elimination. Since there are two Br atoms adjacent, we can eliminate two HBr
