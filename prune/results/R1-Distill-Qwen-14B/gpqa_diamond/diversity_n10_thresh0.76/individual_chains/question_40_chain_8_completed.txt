Okay, so I just came across this chemistry question, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about two chemists talking as they leave a lab. The second chemist says, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." The question is asking what this statement most likely refers to, with four options provided.

Hmm. Let me think about the context. They're in a synthetic organic chemistry lab, so they're probably working with some organic compounds. The phrase "compounds are on top of each other" sounds familiar. I think it's a term used in chemistry, probably in the context of how substances behave when they're in a mixture or when trying to separate them.

Wait, maybe it's about chromatography? Because in chromatography, when you try to separate compounds, if they interact a lot with the stationary phase, they'll move slowly and might "elute" together. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, I remember something about how when two substances have similar properties, like similar polarities or boiling points, they might not separate well in a process like distillation. Oh right! In distillation, if two compounds have close boiling points, it's hard to separate them because they vaporize around the same temperature. So when they're on top of each other, it's hard to get them apart.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Similar polarities. Polar substances tend to interact more, so if two compounds have similar polarities, maybe they stick together in some methods. But I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option B: Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions. Van der Waals forces are intermolecular forces. If the compounds are bonding through these, maybe they stick together physically. But the phrase "on top of each other" suggests they are in the same area, perhaps during a separation process.

Option C: Similar boiling points. That rings a bell. If two compounds have similar boiling points, during distillation, they might come over together, making separation difficult. So the chemist can't get them apart because they're too close in boiling points. So the compounds are "on top" in the same mixture, not separating.

Option D: Similar optical rotations. Optical rotation refers to how a compound rotates plane-polarized light. Similar optical rotations wouldn't necessarily cause them to stick together or be on top of each other. That's more about their physical properties in terms of how they interact with light, not their physical interactions with each other or separation techniques.

Putting it together: When a chemist says "compounds are on top of each other," it's likely they're having trouble separating them because they have similar properties that affect separation. The most common scenario is similar boiling points, which makes distillation difficult. So the answer should be C.


The phrase "my compounds are on top of each other" likely refers to a situation where the compounds are difficult to separate due to a shared property that affects their behavior during a separation process. Among the options, the most plausible explanation is that the compounds have similar boiling points. When compounds have close boiling points, they vaporize at nearly the same temperature, making it challenging to separate them using techniques like distillation. This aligns with the idea of the compounds being "on top of each other" in the same mixture. Other options, such as similar polarities, non-covalent interactions, or optical rotations, do not directly explain the difficulty in separating the compounds as clearly as similar boiling points do.

Answer: C
