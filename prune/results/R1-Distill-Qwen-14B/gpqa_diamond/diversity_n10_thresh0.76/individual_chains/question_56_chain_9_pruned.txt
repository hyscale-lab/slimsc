Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me think about what those are.

The state given is |3,0,0⟩, which I think means n=3, l=0, m=0. And it's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n goes from 3 to 1. But the process is via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... so each transition must follow the dipole selection rules.

I recall that for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the l value changes by ±1 each time. Also, the transition can only happen if the change in m is -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is l=0. If it's a dipole transition, the next state's l has to be l=1 because 0 +1 is 1. So from 3,0,0, the first transition must go to a state with l=1.

Wait, so from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition could go to a state with n=2 or maybe n=4? But wait, n has to decrease because it's decaying, so probably from 3 to 2 or 3 to 1. But since it's a two-step process, maybe 3→2→1.

So first transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩. What could m be? The initial state has m=0. For dipole, m can change by -1, 0, +1. So m could be -1, 0, +1 in the first step.

But the final state after two steps is |1,0,0⟩. So the second transition must take the intermediate state from l=1 to l=0, because the final state's l is 0.

Wait, so the first transition is from l=0 to l=1. Then the next transition from l=1 to l=0. So the intermediate state must have l=1 and n=2, since 3→2, then 2→1.

So the possible first transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |
