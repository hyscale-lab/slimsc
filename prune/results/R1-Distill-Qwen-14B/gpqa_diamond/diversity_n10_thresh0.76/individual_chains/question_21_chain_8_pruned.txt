Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual question is broken into two parts, A and B. So I need to tackle each part separately and then see which option matches.

Part A: Which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does NOT show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

Hmm. Let's start with part A.

First, what is tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structural isomers due to the movement of hydrogen and electrons. It's similar to keto-enol tautomerism in ketones and aldehydes. Tautomerism usually requires the presence of a conjugated system with adjacent double bonds or lone pairs. For example, in aromatic compounds, if there's a conjugated diene or something that allows for resonance, tautomerism might be possible.

So, looking at the two compounds:

1. Benzoquinone: This is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Wait, I think there are two types: para and ortho. But regardless, the structure has two ketone groups in a conjugated system.

2. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the ring is fully substituted with ketones in every other position. So the structure would have three adjacent carbonyl groups? Or are they alternated?

Wait, no. 1,3,5 positions are every other carbon, so in a six-membered ring, they are adjacent across the ring. So the structure would have three carbonyl groups, each separated by one carbon. So the ring has three keto groups in a conjugated arrangement.

Now, tautomerism: for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it needs to have a structure where a hydrogen can move, causing a shift in double bonds. For example, in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, you can have keto-enol tautomerism. But in benzoquinone, it's a benzene ring with two ketones. Benzene is already conjugated. Can tautomerism occur?

Wait, benzoquinone is O= C6H4-C=O. So the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. The ring is fully conjugated, but can the hydrogen shift? Wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is such that the two carbonyls are on adjacent carbons? No, wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 2, right? Or wait, no. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. There are two possible structures: para and ortho. Oh, but wait, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-diketone on the benzene ring. So positions
