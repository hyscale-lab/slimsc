Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, or sometimes called the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings plus double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That sounds a bit complicated. Let me break it down. The base structure is a cyclohexene ring, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The positions are numbered 1 to 6. At position 2, there's a formyl group (-CHO). Position 5 has a vinyl group, which is a CH₂CH₂ group but attached in a way that has another double bond, right? And there's a carboxylic acid group at position 3 or maybe another position? Wait, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond starting at carbon 3. So the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps.

So let me draw this in my mind. The cyclohexene ring has double bond from C3 to C4. Then, at C2, there's a formyl group attached. At C5, there's a vinyl group. And the carboxylic acid is at position 3, but wait, the formula is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the carboxylic acid is at C1? Or maybe C3? Wait, the naming is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the substituent (carboxylic acid) is at position 3. So the numbering would be such that the double bond starts at position 3, and the substituent is also at position 3. That would make sense because substituents with higher priority (like -COOH) take the lower number.

Wait, no, wait. The substituents like carboxylic acid are given the lowest possible number. So the cyclohexene ring is numbered starting from the carboxylic acid as position 1. So, the ring is cyclohexene, with the double bond in position 3. Let me clarify:

The structure is cyclohex-3-ene with a carboxylic acid group at position 3. Wait, that's not possible. Because the double bond in cyclohexene is from C3 to C4, and the substituent is at position 3. So the carboxylic acid would be attached to the same carbon where the double bond starts. Hmm, maybe that's correct.

But perhaps the structure is such that the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl at position 2, and the vinyl at position 5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the molecular structure. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enec
