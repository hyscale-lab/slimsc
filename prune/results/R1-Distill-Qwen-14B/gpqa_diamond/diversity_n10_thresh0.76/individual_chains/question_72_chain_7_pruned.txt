Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's happening. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. This gives product 1.

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to give product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Hmm. Okay, let's start by figuring out each step.

The first reaction: combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and under elevated temperature, perhaps an elimination or substitution reaction is happening. But wait, the dibromomethyl groups are present. Dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So maybe this is a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo compound with a tert-butoxy group. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups on cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Oh wait, maybe this is a diels-alder reaction? Because the bicyclo structure might act as a diene or dienophile.

Wait, the starting material has conjugated double bonds. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene would have two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's a dienophile. The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a diene
