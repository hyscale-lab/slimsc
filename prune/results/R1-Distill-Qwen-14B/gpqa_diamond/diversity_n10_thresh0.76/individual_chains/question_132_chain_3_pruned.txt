Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these things. But let's take it step by step. 

The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. The molecular formula is C10H14 for each. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out what these signals mean. The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) having two singlets suggests that each compound has a set of equivalent protons that are all in the same environment. Since the integration is 1:1, each of the two singlets in the spectrum must come from each of the two compounds. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but wait. Each singlet in the aromatic region corresponds to a certain number of protons. If each is a singlet, the protons must be in a symmetrical environment, so maybe para-substituted or something like that. Or perhaps they're part of a di-substituted ring with symmetry.

Now, looking at the other signals at 2.2 ppm. These are likely from CH3 groups attached to something. Since it's around 2.2, maybe they're attached to an electrondonating group like OMe, but wait, the molecular formula doesn't have oxygen. Oh, right, the formula is C10H14, so maybe they're attached to a benzene ring as substituents. Like methyl groups on the ring.

The three signals in 2.2 ppm are singlets, with a 2:1:1 ratio. So, perhaps three different types of CH3 groups, each appearing as a singlet, and the total integration would be 4 equivalents (2 + 1 +1 = 4). Wait, but each molecule has how many methyl substituents?

Wait, each molecule has a certain number. Let me think: the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents contribute 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens. Wait, 4 carb
