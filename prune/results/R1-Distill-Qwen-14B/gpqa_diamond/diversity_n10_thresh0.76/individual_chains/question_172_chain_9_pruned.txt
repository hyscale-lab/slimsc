Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's see.

The question says that iron atoms in star 1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star 2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where photosynthesis happens, wait no, wait—no, photosphere is the layer emitting light, right? And when they say the atoms are more excited, that probably relates to their energy levels. So higher excitation means more atoms are in higher energy states.

And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Okay. The problem is under the assumption of LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means we can apply the Boltzmann equation for the populations of these energy levels.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. In this case, which level is higher? The question says the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So assuming E2 is higher than E1, then n2 = (n1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

But in the problem, it's observed that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_high) for star_1 is twice that for star_2. So n1_high/n1_low = 2 * (n2_high/n2_low), wait no. Wait, actually, I think the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n1_high / n1_low = 2 (n2_high / n2_low) ? Or perhaps more accurately, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the question says iron atoms in star 1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. So, perhaps the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms is twice as high
