Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is at one end, and the hydroxy group and methyl are on the same carbon. So it's like CH2(CO2H)(CH3)CN? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, perhaps butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, probably a substitution.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. Reacting ketones with NaCN usually leads to cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin is when a nitrile and a hydroxyl group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So the reaction would be: ketone
