Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I need to find is the relative speed between them. Oh right, when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the effects of special relativity.

I remember that the formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction is given by (v1 - v2) divided by (1 minus the product of their velocity ratios over c squared). Or wait, more accurately, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me get that right. So v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So plugging those in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator: (0.6 * 0.5) * c² / c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7. Let's calculate that. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That should match one of the options. Looking at the choices, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, the second part is finding the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. The relativistic energy for each is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (
