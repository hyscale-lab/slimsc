Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, looking at the IR data. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 likely correspond to N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, those are broad peaks, so maybe they're from an amide or an amine. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide.

Moving on to the NMR. Let's break down each peak:

1. 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That triplet is probably a CH3 group attached to something, maybe an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or something like that.

2. 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for two protons. This could be an OCH2 group, like in an ester. Or maybe an NH2 group, but I'm not sure because the IR had some strong N-H stretches, but this is a broad singlet. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, but I'm not certain.

3. 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet with two protons. A quartet usually implies coupling with two neighboring groups. If the chemical shift is around 4.5, that's typical for an OCH2 group, like in an ester. The quartet might be due to coupling with another CH2 group. So maybe this is the OCH2CH3 part of an ethyl ester. Wait, but the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, which is the CH3 in an ethyl group. So perhaps the 4.5 ppm is the OCH2, and the 1.20 is the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen somewhere, like in an ester.

4. 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (each a doublet, 2H each): So two doublets, each integrating for two protons. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) could be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl. So maybe the aromatic ring has a substituent with a carbonyl group attached.

Putting this together: The molecule probably has an ethyl group (from the triplet at 1.20 ppm), an ester group (from the 4.0 and 4.5 ppm peaks), and a para-substituted benzene ring (from the aromatic NMR peaks).

Looking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. For C9H11NO2: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an ester (1 DoU from the carbonyl) and maybe a double bond or something else.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (amide), and the ethoxy would have OCH2CH3. But the NMRâ€”where would the ethoxy be? The ethoxy in para would split into two doublets. Wait, but the aromatic peaks here are two doublets, which fits a para substitution. But benzamide would have an NH group. The IR would have N-H stretch, which the given data shows. But the NMR
