Okay, so I have this physics problem about the potentials in the electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described by scalar and vector potentials. 

The question gives me a scenario where a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and at some earlier time tr, the charge was at a position such that the vector d points from that position to r. The velocity of the charge at time tr is v. I need to find the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, right, the scalar potential is usually related to the electric field, and the vector potential to the magnetic field. The potentials are used in Maxwell's equations, right? The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field via B = ∇×A.

But wait, for a moving charge, how do these potentials look? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right, when charges are moving, especially non-relativistically, we can use the retarded potentials approach. Retarded because the fields depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time, considering the time it takes for the influence to propagate at the speed of light.

So the general expression for the scalar potential is something like V = q/(4πε₀) * [1/(r)] where r is the distance at the retarded time. Similarly, the vector potential A would involve the velocity of the charge. But wait, the problem is giving me different forms in the options, so I need to think about the exact expressions.

Wait, let me think about the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time it takes for the effect of the charge's motion to reach the observation point r. So the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the vector d is r - s(tr). So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

In the case of the potentials, the scalar potential V(r, t) is given by the charge divided by (4πε₀) times 1 over the distance from the charge at the
