Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I should remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. These are also called enantiomers. So, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, they can have other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism, but I think for this question they're asking about chiral centers leading to enantiomers.

Let me look at each of the four compounds given:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
Hmm, this one has a biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can have constitutional isomerism but what about stereoisomerism? Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless there's a substituent that can lead to a chiral center, or perhaps some kind of axial chirality. Biphenyls with different substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality, which is a form of stereoisomerism. But I'm not sure if this compound has any chiral centers.

Wait, the structure is dimethyl, so two ester groups attached to the biphenyl. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, the 2 and 6 positions are on each ring where the substituents are attached. The 2,2' positions have the dicarboxylate groups, and the 6,6' have dinitro groups.

Wait, but the arrangement around the single bond between the two benzene rings could lead to different conformations. But axial chirality, like in biphenyls, requires that the substituents on each ring are in such positions that they create a lack of a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on each ring are in the meta positions relative to the connecting
