Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 1e-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea was to get rid of gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there are fewer gas particles to interfere.

But even with that, some gas particles remained, and the mass spectrometer detected them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1 using factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed something strange. The mean free path changed—it wasn't λ1 anymore, but λ2. And the temperature remained the same, so that shouldn't be a factor.

The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are A to D.

Hmm, what do I remember about mean free path and electron microscopes? Mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, the MFP is longer because there are fewer gas molecules to collide with.

In this case, the vacuum is already ultra-high, so λ1 is probably a large value because the pressure is so low. But when the electron beam is turned on, something must be affecting the gas molecules.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at a high speed. I think the beam can cause various effects. Oh, right, the electrons can interact with the residual gas molecules. Maybe the gas molecules are getting ionized or excited by the electrons.

Wait, another thought: At high voltages like 1000 kV, the electron beam is very energetic. So electrons hitting the gas molecules might cause them to gain energy—like ionization. So when the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles would behave differently in the electric fields of the microscope.

In a vacuum, the gas molecules are neutral, so their mean free path is λ1. But when ionized, they might have a different mean free path because they might interact more or less with the environment.

Wait, but how does ionization affect the MFP? If a molecule is ionized, it becomes a charged particle. In a vacuum, charged particles are influenced by electric fields, but the electron microscope's design includes various lenses and fields. Alternatively, even without external fields, charged particles might have more interactions—like Coulomb interactions with others.

Wait, but in a vacuum, the main interactions are with the walls or other gas molecules. If the gas molecules are ionized, they might stick to the walls of the sample compartment more because charged particles are attracted to the walls if they're conductive. Or they might be repelled if the walls are positively charged. But in reality, the walls are probably conductive, so any ions would be quickly neutralized or pulled to the walls, effectively removing them from the gas phase.

So if ionization happens, the ions could be removed from the gas phase, thereby reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. Wait, but the original pressure was already very low, so the
