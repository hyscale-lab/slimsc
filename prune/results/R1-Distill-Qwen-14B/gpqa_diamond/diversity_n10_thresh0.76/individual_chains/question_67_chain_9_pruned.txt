Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. The problem says to consider their coupled angular momentum state, which is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are 1 for each electron, and when coupled, the total l is 2 and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ each. Wait, L1z and L2z are the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of each electron, right? So each Lz can have eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1.

But wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this is a coupled state, meaning the total angular momentum is considered together. The state is an eigenstate of L² and Lz, where L is the sum of L1 and L2. So L = L1 + L2.

In such a coupled state, each electron's individual angular momentum states are entangled. So to find the probability, I need to expand this coupled state into the product states of individual states. The product states would be |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, where m1
