Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's see what the target molecule is and how I can approach this.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Breaking it down, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde), and then another cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. So the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a CH2CHO group and a CH2OH-cyclohexyl substituent connected to it.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond between two cyclohexane rings. So it's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (which is like a CH2-C≡CH, but actually, ethynyl would be CH2C≡C- attached to the cyclohexane).

I need to find out how to convert this starting material into the target. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, let's outline what needs to happen to the starting material to get to the target. The starting ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Triple bonds can be functionalized in various ways. One common method is hydroboration, but I'm not sure that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH. That suggests some kind of oxidation or perhaps a conjugate addition followed by oxidation. Or maybe a dihydroxylation followed by some rearrangement.

Alternatively, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's CH2(cyclohexyl-OH). Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a CH2 group, which is connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So it's CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). And also, the same cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde group, CHO.

Wait, so the main cyclohexane has two substituents: one is a CH2 group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl, and the other is a CHO group. So the structure is cyclohexane with two substituents: one is CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl), and the other is CHO, attached at the 1-position.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane is probably 1-ethynylcyclohexane, meaning the triple bond is attached to the cyclohexane at position 1. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached.

So how can I get from CH2-C≡CH-cyclohex
