Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let's read the problem again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Wait, okay, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually via substitution. Oh right, the nucleophilic substitution on ketones. But wait, ketones are not typically good at that. Oh wait, maybe it's a ketone undergoing some kind of addition reaction. Or wait, perhaps it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh, yes! Cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) is reacting with NaCN. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. The reaction is likely forming a cyanohydrin, which would add both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense because the carbonyl group would become a CH(OH)CN group.

So the reaction for the first part is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The reagent A here is probably an acid catalyst. H3O+ is a common acid, like from HCl or H2SO4. So A would be H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And the reagent is B, which is H2O, right? So what's happening here? The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does that happen? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed into carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either acidic or basic. For acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, you might need something like HCl, and maybe heat. But wait, the reagent B is H2O. Oh, but perhaps the reagent B is the acid, like HCl, and the water is part of the reaction. Let me think.

Alternatively, the reaction could be hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. I think that generally, nitriles hydrolyze in acidic conditions to give carboxylic acids. So the reagent B would be an acid. So in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Looking at the options, option A says B is HCl. Option B says B is CH3COOH. Option C and D have B as HCl and CH3COOH, respectively.

Wait, the reagent B is given as (H2O), but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Or is reagent B something else, and the reaction is with H2O? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, looking again: the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) â†’ product. Oh, so the reagent B is H2O, and the reaction is hydrolysis. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in the presence of H2O and some conditions.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis usually requires acid or base. So if it's acidic conditions, it's H+ and water. So maybe B is an acid, like HCl, which would protonate the nitrile and help in hydrolysis.

So for B, the reagent is HCl. Looking at the options, which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? Let's check the options.

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl. That's possible.

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl. Hmm, no, I think in the first reaction we need an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the second reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Another approach is using a strong acid and water. So for the second step, B could be HCl. So
