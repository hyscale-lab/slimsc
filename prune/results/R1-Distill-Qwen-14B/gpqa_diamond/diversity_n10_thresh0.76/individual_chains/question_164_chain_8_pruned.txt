Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, we have two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then there's some data about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? And the mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to detect the masses of the stars. The idea is that each star orbits the common center of mass, so their velocities cause Doppler shifts in their spectra. The amplitude of these velocity variations relates to the mass of the other star.

Wait, the formula I think I need is something like the mass function. Oh right, the mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I think the formula involves the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period. The mass function for each star in the binary system is (v1^3 * P) / (2πG), or something like that. Or maybe it's (v^3 * P) divided by something else. Alternatively, maybe the mass ratio comes into play.

Wait, I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? And their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because F = ma, so a = F/m. Since both are orbiting the same center, their accelerations are the same, so the more massive one has a smaller velocity.

So, for a binary system, the velocity amplitudes (v1 and v2) are related to the mass ratio. The mass ratio q = m2/m1. And the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, v1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * V, where V is the orbital speed of the combined system. Or wait, maybe it's v1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * (2πa1 / P), and similar for v2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each star's velocity amplitude is proportional to the mass of the other star. So, v1 is proportional to m2, and v2 is proportional to m1. Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity. So, v1 / v2 = m2 / m1.

Wait, if that's the case, then for each system, the ratio of the two velocities would give the inverse of the mass ratio.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So the ratio is 10/5 =
