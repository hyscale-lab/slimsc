Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from my QFT classes.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I know that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably for electromagnetism since it's F and not something else.

Wait, what's the dimension of each field here? I think for fermions, like the ψ in the Dirac spinor, each ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac equation requires the fields to have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? The field strength tensor is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A, right? F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A has dimension 1, because A is a gauge field which is like a vector potential, so dimension 1. Then F, being derivatives of A, would have dimension 2? Because each derivative is dimension 1.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, so their commutator doesn't contribute any mass dimension. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the product of two gamma matrices, but since they're just matrices, it's dimensionless.

Wait, but wait. When you have terms in the Lagrangian, each term must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of energy^4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

So, let's look at L_int: κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Breaking it down, the product ψ̄ σ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then, F is dimension 2, so the entire term (without κ) has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

But the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, so κ must compensate for that. So the dimension of κ is 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M is -1.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me count each part:

- ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.
- σ_{μν} is dimensionless, as it's a commutator of gamma matrices.
- ψ has 3/2.
- F has dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ * σ * ψ is (
