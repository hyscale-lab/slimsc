Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, right? So in solution, the Ca^2+ ions are bound to EDTA, forming this complex. 

I recall that the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So in this case, Kf is 5e10, which is pretty large, meaning the complex is very stable.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because EDTA binds Ca^2+, the free Ca^2+ concentration in solution should be quite low, I think. Because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

So the setup is that the solution is 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA. Let me denote the complex as [CaEDTA]^2- maybe. So the concentration of this complex is 0.02 M. 

In solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (or some form, depending on pH). But given the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its correct form (like Y^4-), so the dissociation can be written as:

[CaEDTA]^2- ⇌ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is given by Kf = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

But wait, no, the formation constant is actually for the formation reaction. The formation reaction is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-

So the Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But sometimes people use the reverse reaction, so I should be careful.

Wait, in the problem, they gave K_ca-EDTA as 5e10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = 5e10.

So if the solution has 0.02 M of the complex, then the initial assumption is that all the Ca is in the complex, but due to dissociation, some will be free.

Let me set up the variables. Let's let the concentration of [Ca^2+] be x. Then, since each complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- is also x. The concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA]^2-, would then be 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e
