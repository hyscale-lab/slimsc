Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D.

Each option describes a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. Oh wait, but volume is related to radius as well because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if a planet's radius changes, the volume changes, which affects density.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same mass and radius as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet has that density. So option a has density 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question is asking which has the highest density. So if this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth, then that's the same as option a. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, the question says the planet has a density of 5.5. Hmm, so its density is 5.5, same as a and Earth.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Same composition implies same density because composition
