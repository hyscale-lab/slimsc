Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about nuclear fission and calculating the kinetic energy of one of the fragments, considering relativistic effects versus the classical approximation. Hmm, I need to think carefully.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, wait: If M is the initial mass, the sum of the two fragments' rest mass is 0.99M. That means the mass lost is 1% of M, which probably goes into kinetic energy or other forms like binding energy, but maybe that's negligible? No, in fission, some energy is released, so probably the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the one calculated classically.

Okay, let's break this down. First, find the masses of the two fragments. Let me call the two fragments m1 and m2, with m1 being the more massive. So, m1 = 2 * m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99M.

So substituting, 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M → m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M. So m1 is 2 * 0.33M ≈ 0.66M. Wait, but 0.33 *3 is 0.99, right. So m1 is 0.66M, m2 is 0.33M.

Wait, no: 0.99M divided by 3? 0.99/3 is 0.33, which is 0.33M. So m1 is 0.66M, m2 0.33M. Got it.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum must be zero after fission. So the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum. So, their momenta p1 and p2 must satisfy p1 = -p2.

In the center-of-momentum frame, which is the rest frame of the original nucleus, the two fragments will have opposite momenta. But in this case, the nucleus is at rest, so that's the frame we're working in.

Now, for the kinetic energy, I need to calculate relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment. But wait, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the non-relativistic approximation.

I remember that in non-relativistic mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But relativistically, it's (gamma - 1)mc².

So, to find the correct T1 and the classical T1, then take their difference.

But how do I find the velocities or
