Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's go step by step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, forming an alkene. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, right, sometimes elimination can form an allene if the structure allows. Or maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, KOH in such conditions usually leads to elimination, not epoxidation. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the molecule has two bromines on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure.

When KOH is used, it's likely an elimination (dehydrohalogenation) to form an alkene. But wait, for elimination, we need a base to abstract a proton and the halide leaves. So 1,3-dibromo would eliminate to form 1,3-didehydroadamantane or something like that. But looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Oh, and IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, so maybe it's not elimination but a substitution reaction?

Wait, wait. KOH and dibromide. Another possibility is a double substitution. If both bromides are replaced with hydroxyl groups, but that would give a diol. But the IR here shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxide would have an oxygen with two adjacent CH2 groups, but the IR would show an epoxide
