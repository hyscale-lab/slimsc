Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But let's try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, waitâ€”I remember that states should be normalized, right? So maybe I need to check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the magnitude squared of each component and sum them up.

So the state vector is a 3x1 matrix: [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not normalized. That could complicate things because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector. Hmm, but maybe the problem assumes it's normalized or I have to normalize it first.

Wait, perhaps I should normalize it. The normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(6), right? So the actual state vector would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Alright, moving on. We have two observables, P and Q, each represented by a matrix. The question is about measuring P first, then Q. And we need the probability that P gives 0 and Q gives -1.

Wait, no. Wait, the order is important. The question says if someone measures Q just after measuring P.
