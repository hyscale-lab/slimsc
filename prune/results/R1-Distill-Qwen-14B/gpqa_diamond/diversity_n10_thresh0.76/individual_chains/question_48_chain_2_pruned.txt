Alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Okay, so the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. Hmm.

Let me break down each step one by one.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine forms product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine in a specific condition, it's usually an addition reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Bromine addition to a carbonyl could be via the enolate, but wait, another possibility is that it's an alpha substitution. Or wait, no, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh! Bromine might add to the carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienol bromination?

Wait, no, another thought: When ketones react with bromine (like in a haloform reaction?), but wait, the haloform reaction is with excess X2 and under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a bromination via the enol. So, cyclohexanone can form an enol, and then bromine adds to the double bond. So, the product would be 3-bromo cyclohexanone? Or wait, maybe it's an alpha bromination.

Wait, another approach: The reaction of ketones with bromine in a solution like H2O with H2SO4 might lead to dibromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 in, say, a non-polar solventâ€”maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl, forming a bromo derivative. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's a Bromination at the alpha position. So, cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl). Adding bromine could lead to substitution at the alpha position. Oh right, when ketones react with Br2 in presence of a base, it's the alpha-bromination. Wait, but wait: Alternatively, in the presence of light, it could be free radical substitution, but I don't think that's the case here. So, product 1 would be 2-bromo-cyclohexanone.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. Cyclohexanone
