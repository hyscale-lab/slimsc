Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

So, there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the Pz operator.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔPz, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then compute sqrt of their difference.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So to find the expectation values, I'll have to compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| Pz² |ψ⟩. But since the basis is of Pz's eigenvectors, maybe there's a shortcut.

Let me write down the given matrices. Let me note them:

Px matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

Py matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

Pz matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

The state vector ψ is given as a column [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]^T. So it's a 3-component vector.

Since the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz, each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue of Pz. The eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective basis states |1>, |2>, |3>.

So let me denote the state ψ as a linear combination of these basis vectors. But wait, ψ is already expressed in this basis. So each component is the amplitude for each eigenstate of Pz. That is, the first component is the amplitude for |1> (eigenvalue ħ), the second for |2> (0), and the third for |3> (-ħ).

Wait, but when I compute the expectation value of Pz, ⟨Pz⟩, since each basis state |i> has eigenvalue p_i, the expectation value is Σ |c_i|² p_i, where c_i are the coefficients. Because when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is just the weighted average of the eigenvalues with probabilities |c_i|².

So, let's compute that. The coefficients are:

c1 = -1/2
c2 = 1/√2
c3 = -1/2

So |c1|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|c2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|c3|² is 1/4

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ + 0 = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨Pz²⟩? Since Pz is a diagonal matrix in this basis, Pz² is just the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues of Pz squared are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is Σ |c_i|² (p_i)^2. Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

So now the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches this result.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Because sometimes in quantum mechanics, the expectation values can be tricky, especially when the state isn't an eigenstate of the operator.

Wait, in this case, the state is an eigenstate of Px, which is not the same as Pz. But since the basis is Pz's eigenbasis, the state is written as a combination of |1>, |2>, |3>, which are eigenstates of Pz. So the method I used is correct because each component's square modulus gives the probability of each eigenstate.

So the calculation steps seem correct. So I think the correct answer is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $\psi$, given as a column vector $[-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2]^T$, expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. The coefficients of $\psi$ in this basis are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are $|c_1|^2 = 1/4$, $|c_2|^2 = 1/2$, and $|c_3|^2 = 1/4$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
Since $\psi$ is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the weighted average of the eigenvalues of $P_z$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum |c_i|^2 \cdot p_i = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum |c_i|^2 \cdot (p_i)^2 = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
