Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in several compounds. I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Hmm, optical activity means the compound has chiral centers or some form of asymmetry that leads to enantiomers. But wait, I remember that some compounds can have stereogenic centers but still not be chiral if there's a plane of symmetry or if they're part of a meso compound. So I need to check each one carefully.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   The structure is like CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but at the double bond, the configuration is Z. So the substituents on either side are same priority? So the molecule would be either cis or trans. But wait, is there a chiral center here? The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. The carbon with Cl has only one substituent (Cl), so that's not a chiral center. Wait, that carbon is attached to Cl, a methyl group (from CH2Cl?), wait no, maybe the structure is different. Wait, but wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw it.

   But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no, but because it's but-1-ene, so positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Then 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait no, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So C1 is connected to Cl, and the double bond to C2 which also has a methyl and another CH2 group.

   Wait, so the molecule is Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH(CH3)? No, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2?

   Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then substituents are on C1 and C2. C1 has a Cl and a double bond. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. So the structure is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, no, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl. So the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps.

   Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of it as CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2 but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the name is but-1-ene, so the double bond starts at C1. So positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded. So the structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, but that would make the structure CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2, which is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3 → no, that can't be right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3.

   So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's not possible because that would be a substituent on C2. So, the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's 4 carbons. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, a methyl on C2. So structure is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

   Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just think about whether this molecule has any chiral centers. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups, and C2 has a methyl and a CH2 group. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. But I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a double bond, and the substituents on each carbon are arranged in a certain way.

   Wait, perhaps the molecule is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. So, the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, because the name is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure must be CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)=CH2–CH3? Wait, no, that would be buta-1,3-diene or something else.

   Maybe I'm getting stuck here, but the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Looking at the molecule, if the substituents around a carbon are all different, it's a chiral center. But in this case, the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. On C1, the substituents are Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe on C2, the substituents are methyl, and two other groups. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because the substituents on each side of the double bond don't create a chiral center.

   Wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, on C1, you have Cl, a hydrogen, and two CH2 groups? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH2. So, CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, the double bond can't be between C1 and C2 if it's but-1-ene. So, maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but I think the main point is that this molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and on each of these carbons, the substituents might not be all different. For example, C1 has Cl, CH2, and two CH2 groups? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Wait, if the molecule is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, then perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two CH2 groups and a substituent. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should just think that this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it's not optically active. Or maybe it does have a chiral center. Wait, perhaps the Cl is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups, a double bond, and Cl. That would make four different substituents, which would be a chiral center. Oh! Wait, if the carbon where the Cl is attached (C1) is connected to Cl, a double bond (to C2), and two CH2 groups, then perhaps it's CH2Cl with the double bond. Wait, no, C1 is connected to Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups. So, substituents are Cl, double bond (which counts as a substituent, perhaps as a single group?), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, maybe the substituents are Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond is part of the structure. So, if the substituents are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (if that's the case), and maybe another group. Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a trans configuration, but that doesn't necessarily make it chiral.

   Wait, maybe I should move on and come back. The next compound is (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Methanoisobenzofuran would have a ring structure, perhaps a bicyclic system. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl–CH2–. The stereochemistry is specified, so perhaps this compound is chiral. The presence of the E configuration in the double bond might imply some asymmetry. But wait, does the presence of multiple stereocenters or a double bond with configuration contribute to optical activity? Because if it has a stereogenic center, then yes. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be. But given the substituents, and the presence of R and S configurations, this compound likely has chirality and is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC–CH2–CH2–COOH. The 2 and 3 positions are both methyl-substituted. So the structure is HOOC–C(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. Wait, no, 2 and 3 positions, so it's HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. Wait, no, 2 would be the second carbon, which is the first CH2 group in the four-carbon chain. So succinic acid is four carbons: positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So 2 and 3 are the two middle CH2 groups. So substituting methyl groups on both 2 and 3 would make the structure HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. Now, looking for chiral centers. Each of the 2 and 3 carbons have two CH groups. Let's see: On carbon 2, substituents are two methyl groups, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). Wait, no, perhaps I should list substituents:

   For the 2R configuration: the substituents on C2 are:
   - the COOH group (from C1),
   - a CH(CH3) group (from C3),
   - two methyl groups (from the substituents).
   Wait, no, wait. Carbon 2 in succinic acid is CH2. When you substitute methyl groups, it becomes CH(CH3). So, for (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So, for C2, what are the four substituents? The substituents are: a COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3) group (from C3), a methyl group (from substitution), and a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait, each of these is a substituent. Let me think: Carbon 2 is connected to:
   - The first COOH (from C1),
   - The next carbon (C3, which is CH(CH3)),
   - Two CH3 groups? Or is it connected to a CH3, a COOH, and two other substituents?

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. So each of the middle carbons has two methyl groups attached. Wait, that would make each of these carbons CH2 with two methyl groups? Wait, no, because in succinic acid, each of the middle carbons is CH2. Adding a methyl would make it CH(CH3). So each of C2 and C3 would have two substituents: a methyl and a hydrogen, but that can't be because they have four bonds.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each substituent. For C2 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:

   - One bond to C1 (which is a COOH group via a CH2 group),
   - One bond to C3 (which is also CH(CH3)),
   - Two methyl groups attached to C2.

   Wait, that would make four substituents: two methyl groups, a CH2–COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. So, the substituents are: methyl, methyl, CH2COOH, and CH(CH3)COOH. Wait, no, because the rest of the structure is -CH2–COOH. So perhaps for C2, the substituents are: two methyl groups, a hydrogen, and a CH2–COOH group. Wait, that can't be because that would make four substituents, but two are methyl, one is H, and one is CH2COOH. Then, would that make it a chiral center? Because the substituents are two methyls, H, and CH2COOH. No, because two substituents are the same (two methyl groups), so the carbon would not be chiral. Because for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So if two are same, it's not chiral.

   Wait, but wait! The molecule is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the C2 and C3 has a methyl group, but perhaps the other substituents are different. Let me re-examine. So, C2 has a methyl, a hydrogen, a COOH group (from C1), and a substituent to C3, which is CH(CH3). Hmm, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group and other substituents that make them chiral.

   Wait, maybe the structure is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. Let's look at C2: substituents are:
   - HOOC–CH2– (from C1),
   - CH(CH3)–COOH (from C3),
   - two methyl groups.

   No, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, perhaps C2 is connected to:
   - a COOH group (from C1),
   - a CH(CH3) group (C3),
   - two methyl groups.

   Wait, that's three substituents. No, wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's better to consider that each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl, making them each CH(CH3). So, their substituents would be:
   - C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), two CH3 groups.
   - C3: COOH (from C4), CH(CH3) (from C2), two CH3 groups.

   But wait, that would mean that each of these carbons has two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3). So, substituents on C2: two CH3, one COOH (as part of the chain), and one CH(CH3). So same substituent (CH3) appears twice. So, the substituents are: two CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). So, two substituents are the same. Thus, the carbon isn't a chiral center. So, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would not have any chiral centers because both C2 and C3 have two methyl groups each, making them not chiral. Wait, but if the configuration is R and S, are the two chiral centers making the molecule chiral despite having identical substituents? Wait no, because each chiral center requires four distinct substituents. If a carbon has two identical substituents, it can't be a chiral center. So, this molecule would not be chiral. Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again: for a carbon to be chiral, all four substituents must be different. So, in this case, each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups, which means they can't be chiral centers. So, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers and thus isn't optically active. Wait, but then why does the question specify (2R,3S) configuration? Because if the molecule isn't chiral, the R and S designations are meaningless. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, which would mean it has multiple chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a plane of symmetry.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Similar to the previous compound, just with both R configurations. So again, looking at the structure, each of the C2 and C3 has a methyl group. Are they chiral centers? From the earlier analysis, no, because each has two methyl groups as substituents, making their substituents not all different. So, same as the previous compound, this molecule isn't chiral. Wait, but wait, perhaps the configuration leads to a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, the molecule could be a meso compound, making it achiral. So, for (2R,3R), if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound and thus not optically active. Alternatively, if the two centers are both R, but there's no plane of symmetry, then maybe they are chiral. Wait, but in succinic acid, the two middle carbons are adjacent. So, substituting both with methyl groups may create a plane of symmetry. For example, if the two substituents are both on the same side, the molecule could be symmetric. So, perhaps this is a meso compound and not chiral, making it not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   Okay, cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (assuming numbering). The configuration is R. So, the substituents around C1 would be the hydroxyl, the cyclohexene ring, and other substituents. Let's think about whether C1 is a chiral center. The structure is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, meaning the hydroxyl is on C1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the molecule has the hydroxyl group on C1, which is connected to the rest of the ring. So, the substituents around C1 would be: OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and the rest of the ring. Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure. Cyclohexene ring with double bond between C3 and C4. The hydroxyl is on C1. So, C1 has four substituents: OH, the ring (which can be considered as two CH2 groups connected to adjacent carbons), and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons. So, C1 would have substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6?), and the rest of the ring. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that C1 has four substituents: OH, two adjacent CH2 groups, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps C1's substituents are OH, three CH2 groups? No, that can't be because each carbon in a ring has two adjacent carbons, each connected by single bonds. Maybe I should think about the actual substituents.

   So, for C1: it's attached to OH, and connected to C2 and C6 (assuming the numbering is 1,2,3,4,5,6 in the ring). Wait, but in a cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So, C1 has substituents: OH, CH2–C2, CH2–C6, and... perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, no, because in a cyclohexane, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. So, C1 would have two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), a OH group, and a hydrogen. So, substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. So, four substituents, but two are same (the two CH2 groups), so C1 isn't a chiral center. Wait, but wait, maybe the ring's structure leads to different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the ring substituents are not the same. Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents are OH, CH2–C2 (which is CH2–CH2–...), CH2–C6 (which might be CH2–CH2–...), and a hydrogen. So, two CH2 groups might not be the same if the ring is in a certain conformation, but in reality, the two CH2 groups are identical because the ring is symmetric. So, substituents would be OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. Therefore, C1 isn't a chiral center. Wait, but the configuration is given as R. That suggests that C1 is a chiral center, which contradicts my earlier analysis. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

   Alternatively, perhaps the ring is substituted in such a way that the substituents around C1 are all different. For example, if C2 and C6 have different substituents, then the two CH2 groups would be different, making C1 a chiral center. But in this case, the molecule is a cyclohexene with a hydroxyl on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So, perhaps the substituents on C1 are OH, a CH2–C2 (which is CH2–CH2–...), a CH2–C6 (CH2–CH2–...), and a hydrogen. But in the ring, C2 and C6 are each connected to C1 and to C3 and C5. If the ring is symmetric, then the substituents on C1 would be two identical CH2 groups, making C1 not a chiral center. But if the ring isn't symmetric, perhaps the substituents are different. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. But without a clear picture, it's hard to say. However, the (R) configuration suggests that there is a chiral center. So perhaps this compound is optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   So, the cyclohexane ring has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configuration is s for each. Let's see if this creates any chirality. Each of these hydroxyls is on a carbon that's part of the ring. Let's look at C1. The substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, again, the substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups, and H. Are those two CH2 groups identical? If the ring is symmetric with all OHs on alternate carbons, perhaps each of the OH-bearing carbons is a chiral center. For example, C1 has OH, two CH2 groups, and H. But if the substituents are all different, then it's a chiral center. Wait, but the two CH2 groups would be identical if the ring is symmetric. So, substituents would be OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. Thus, C1 wouldn't be a chiral center. But wait, the molecule has three hydroxyl groups. Let's think about the entire molecule's symmetry. If all three OHs are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are arranged in a certain way, the molecule could be chiral.

   However, considering the configuration (1s,3s,5s), perhaps each of the OHs is on the same side, leading to a non-superimposable mirror image. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral because of some symmetry. But with three substituents in the same configuration, it's possible that the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, suppose the three OHs are arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a chiral center. But if each has two identical substituents (like two CH2 groups), then they aren't chiral. So, maybe this molecule isn't chiral. But wait, the configuration s suggests that each of these carbons is a chiral center. So perhaps each has four different substituents. Let me think: for C1, substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen. If the two CH2 groups are different, then C1 is a chiral center. But in a regular cyclohexane ring, the substituents on either side of C1 would be symmetric. So, perhaps the two CH2 groups are the same, making C1 not a chiral center. Hmm, but if the ring is such that the substituents are different, then maybe it is. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule has three chiral centers but is a meso compound due to a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along a plane, making it achiral despite having chiral centers. But without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky. However, given that all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), it's possible that the molecule is chiral. So, this compound might exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone on C1). So, the structure is cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH2–CH3. Wait, but the ketone is on C1, so the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. Now, checking for chiral centers. The carbonyl group is on C1, so the substituents would be cyclopentyl, CO, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the CO is part of the ketone. Let me think: the molecule is (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a ketone (so carbonyl group), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3.

   So, the molecule is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl is on C1, so it's a ketone. The adjacent carbons are C2, which is CH2, C3, which is CH2, C4, CH3. Are any of these carbons chiral? C2: connected to CO, two CH2 groups, and a CH3. So substituents are CO–, two CH2 groups, and a CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me list the substituents for each carbon:

   - C1: cyclopentyl, carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and two CH2 groups. No, wait, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which has a double bond to O. So, substituents are cyclopentyl, O (double bond), and two CH2 groups. But that's three substituents, which can't be right because a carbon must have four bonds. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CH2–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. No, the question says butan-1-one, which is (CH3)2CO for butan-2-one. Wait, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a four-carbon chain with the ketone on C1, which would be (CH2)3CO, which isn't correct. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of a butanone, which is (CH2)3CO. So, the structure is cyclopentyl–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. Now, checking each carbon for chirality.

   C1: attached to cyclopentyl, CO group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, so it's double-bonded to O. So, substituents are cyclopentyl, O (double bond), and two CH2 groups. Hmm, but that's three substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)methyl group attached to a ketone. So, it's (cyclopentyl)–CH2–CO–CH2–CH3? No, because the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but with substituents on C1 and C3. So, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, but how does that work? Wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, which is the same as the end of the chain. So, for butan-1-one, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible because that would be an aldehyde, not a ketone. Oh wait, no, butan-1-one would be (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon, which is a ketone. So, the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3. Now, looking at each carbon:

   C1 (carbonyl carbon): cyclopentyl, O, and two CH2 groups. Since it's a carbonyl, it's double-bonded to O, so substituents are cyclopentyl, O, and perhaps two CH2 groups. But that would make three substituents, which isn't possible. So perhaps the structure is (cyclopentyl)–CH2–CO–CH2–CH3. Now, looking for chiral centers:

   C2: attached to (cyclopentyl)CH2, CO, and two CH2 groups. So substituents are cyclopentylCH2, CO, and two CH2 groups. Not all different, so no chiral center.

   C3: attached to CO, two CH2 groups, and a CH3. So substituents are CO, two CH2, and CH3. Again, not all different.

   C4: CH3, two CH2 groups, and perhaps a hydrogen. No.

   So, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and is thus not optically active.

Now, compiling the analysis:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has stereogenic centers. Optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups, so no chiral centers. Not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Same as above. Not active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: If C1 has a chiral center, yes. Given the R configuration, it's likely active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: If each OH is on a chiral center, and the molecule isn't a meso compound, then yes. But if it's a meso compound due to symmetry, then no. Without a clear structure, it's hard to say, but given the same configuration on all three, it's likely chiral.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. Not active.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 5 might have a chiral center. Let me recheck.

Compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Let's imagine the structure: a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl on C1. The substituents on C1 are: OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen. Are the two CH2 groups identical? In a regular cyclohexene, the ring is symmetric, so the CH2 groups on either side of C1 would be identical. Thus, the substituents would be OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. That would make C1 not a chiral center. So, this compound wouldn't be optically active. Hmm, so that would change my earlier conclusion.

So, updating the analysis:

Active compounds:

2. Yes.

5. No.

6. Hmm, trying to decide again.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. Each of the OHs is on a carbon that's part of the ring. For each of these carbons, substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. If the two CH2 groups are identical, then no chiral center. But perhaps the ring's arrangement makes the substituents different. Alternatively, maybe each OH is on a chiral center. If the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, it might be a meso compound, making it achiral. But given the substituents are on C1, C3, and C5, which are all separated by one carbon, perhaps the molecule is chiral. For example, if the three OHs are all on the same face, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three carbons is a chiral center, but the molecule as a whole is a meso compound. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule is not chiral because of a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it a meso compound. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given the same configuration on all three, it's possible that the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the three hydroxyl groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if each of the three carbons is a chiral center and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. So, I'll tentatively count this as optically active.

So, recapping:

Active compounds: 2, 5? Or no?

Wait, earlier I thought compound 5 isn't active because C1 isn't a chiral center. So, let's see:

Active:

2. Yes.

5. No.

6. Yes.

7. No.

So, how many? Let's count:

- Compound 2: active.

- Compound 6: active.

- Are there others?

Wait, let's go back to compound 4: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Earlier analysis suggested no chiral centers. So, not active.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake about compound 6. Let's consider: the molecule has three hydroxyls on alternate carbons. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along an axis passing through C2 and C6, then perhaps it's a meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetric. So, perhaps this molecule is not chiral. Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. Alternatively, perhaps each of the three CHOH groups is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral overall.

If I count:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 5: no.

Compound 6: yes.

Wait, but I'm not confident about 6. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric and thus not chiral.

So, perhaps only compounds 2 and 5 are active. Wait, but I thought 5 isn't active. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to summarize:

1. No.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

5. No.

6. ?

7. No.

So, if 6 is active, that's two. If not, then only compound 2.

But I think I might have missed some compounds. Let me think again. Wait, the third compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Earlier I thought that each of the 2 and 3 carbons have two methyl groups, making them not chiral. But wait, perhaps in succinic acid, the 2 and 3 carbons are each CH2, and when methyl groups are added, they become CH(CH3). So, for (2R,3S), each of those carbons would have substituents: two different groups from the acid, a methyl, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, let's actually list the substituents for C2 in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Succinic acid is HOOC–CH2–CH2–COOH. When you add methyl groups to C2 and C3, they become HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH. So, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So, substituents on C2: 

- One bond to C1 (which is -CH2–COOH),
- One bond to C3 (which is -CH(CH3)–COOH),
- Two methyl groups (CH3).

Wait, but that's three substituents. Wait, no. Each CH(CH3) has four bonds. So, the substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3),
- Two CH2 groups (to C1 and C3),
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because when you add a methyl to CH2, it becomes CH(CH3). So, the substituents would be:

- For C2: a methyl group, a CH2–COOH group (from C1), a CH(CH3)–COOH group (from C3), and a hydrogen. So, substituents are: CH3, CH2COOH, CH(CH3)COOH, and H. Are all four substituents different? CH3 (methyl), CH2COOH, CH(CH3)COOH, and H. Each of these is different, so C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is also a chiral center because its substituents are CH3, CH(CH3)COOH, CH2COOH, and H. Wait, but if the configurations are R and S, then the molecule would have two chiral centers. But would that make the molecule chiral overall, or would it be a meso compound?

The molecule is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH with R and S configurations on C2 and C3. Let's imagine the molecule: if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, the molecule could be a meso compound, making it achiral. But if they are not, then the molecule would be chiral.

But in this case, since the configurations are R and S, perhaps the molecule is not a meso compound. For example, if the substituents on C2 are arranged such that the configuration is R and on C3 it's S, the molecule might lack a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the two chiral centers are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it could be a meso compound. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the mirror image across the plane makes the two chiral centers mirror images, leading to a meso form.

But in this case, the configurations are R and S. So, for example, if C2 is R and C3 is S, perhaps the molecule is not a meso compound. Because in a meso compound, the chiral centers would have opposite configurations but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound, making it achiral.

Wait, let me think. For a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple chiral centers and a plane of symmetry that makes the molecule achiral. So, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when the configurations are R and S on the two chiral centers and there's a plane of symmetry.

In this case, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound and thus not chiral. So, how to determine if such a plane exists.

Looking at the structure:

HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH

The molecule is symmetric around the central axis. So, if you mirror the left and right sides, the configurations would swap. If C2 is R and C3 is S, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, but wait. If (2R,3S) is the configuration, and the molecule is symmetric, then perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. Hence, it isn't chiral.

So, in that case, compound 3 (2R,3S) is a meso compound and not optically active. Similarly, compound 4 (2R,3R) would have two R configurations. But would that create a plane of symmetry?

For example, if the two R configurations are on both C2 and C3, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine: for (2R,3R), the substituents on C2 are arranged in a certain way, and C3 similarly. Would that make the molecule chiral? If the molecule isn't symmetric, then yes.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the specific molecular structures.

If the molecule is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH with (2R,3S), then perhaps it's a meso compound because the configurations are opposite and the molecule is symmetrical. But if it's (2R,3R), then perhaps it's not a meso compound, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that the presence of two chiral centers with opposite configurations in a symmetrical molecule makes it a meso compound, thus not chiral.

So, for (2R,3S), if the molecule is symmetric, it's a meso compound. Hence, not optically active. For (2R,3R), if the molecule isn't symmetric, then it's chiral and optically active.

But wait, in succinic acid, the two middle carbons are adjacent and part of a symmetrical four-carbon chain. So, adding methyl groups in a symmetrical way would result in the molecule being a meso compound when the configurations are R and S. Thus, (2R,3S) would be a meso compound, making it optically inactive. However, (2R,3R) would not have such symmetry, making it chiral and optically active.

Wait, but earlier I considered (2R,3S) and (2R,3R) as two separate compounds. So, for compound 3: (2R,3S) is a meso compound → not active. Compound 4: (2R,3R) is not a meso compound → active.

So, updating the analysis:

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. Yes.

5. No.

6. ?

7. No.

Now, back to compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If the three OHs are on alternate carbons, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along an axis passing through the center of the ring, then it would be achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a triol with three chiral centers, but a plane of symmetry exists, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral. For example, if the substituents on C1, C3, and C5 are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering that all three OHs are in the same configuration (s), it's possible that the molecule is not symmetric. So, it might be chiral and exhibit optical activity.

So, updating:

2. Yes.

4. Yes.

6. Yes.

So, three active compounds. Others are inactive.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about compound 6. Let me think again: if all three OHs are on the same face of the ring, perhaps the molecule is chiral. But if they're arranged symmetrically, it might be a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric and thus is chiral.

So, perhaps compounds 2, 4, and 6 are active.

Wait, but earlier I thought 5 was not active, but perhaps 5 is active. Let me recheck.

Compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. If C1 isn't a chiral center, then it's not active. So, 5 is not active.

So, the active compounds are 2, 4, and 6: that's three.

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 5 isn't active. So, three compounds.

Wait, the initial count is 3. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So, the answer would be B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry, such as a meso compound lacking a plane of symmetry. Below is the analysis of each compound:

---

### 1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
- The structure is **Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2**.
- The double bond between C1 and C2 creates a planar sp² hybridized carbon, which cannot be a chiral center.
- There are no other chiral centers in the molecule.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
- This is a complex bicyclic structure with stereogenic centers at C3a and C7a, as indicated by the **R** and **S** configurations.
- The **E** configuration of the double bond adds to the asymmetry.
- The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.
- **Optically active.**

---

### 3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is **HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH**.
- Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers because they are bonded to four distinct groups: a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon.
- However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
- The structure is **HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH**.
- Both C2 and C3 are chiral centers, as they are bonded to four distinct groups: a carboxylic acid group, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon.
- The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the configurations at C2 and C3 are the same (**R** and **R**), breaking the symmetry.
- **Optically active.**

---

### 5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
- The structure is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.
- The substituents on C1 are **OH, CH2–C2, CH2–C6, and H**. Two of these substituents (CH2–C2 and CH2–C6) are identical due to the symmetry of the ring.
- A chiral center requires four distinct substituents, so C1 is not a chiral center.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### 6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
- The structure is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5.
- Each of these carbons is bonded to **OH, two CH2 groups, and H**. Due to the alternating positions of the hydroxyl groups, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.
- The molecule has three chiral centers, and the overall configuration does not result in a meso compound.
- **Optically active.**

---

### 7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
- The structure is **(cyclopentyl)–CO–CH2–CH2–CH3**.
- The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center.
- None of the other carbons in the molecule have four distinct substituents.
- **Not optically active.**

---

### Final Count of Optically Active Compounds:
