Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the particles they involve.

Symmetries in physics are crucial because they dictate the form of the interactions. Effective theories must respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're replacing. The Standard Model respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT, which is an effective theory, should too.

Let's go through each symmetry mentioned:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):** The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, meaning it respects the symmetry of special relativity. So any operator in SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Effective operators are usually written in a way that maintains this symmetry. So I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

2. **Poincare Symmetry (Option 2):** Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). Since the Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, SMEFT operators must also comply. But wait, in effective field theories, sometimes only the symmetries of the original theory are preserved. Since the Standard Model already has Poincare, SMEFT should too. But I'm a bit confused because I thought Lorentz is a subset. Hmm, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So both Lorentz and Poincare would be required. But wait, waitâ€”Poincare includes stuff like momentum conservation, which is built into the structure of the theory. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare as well. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Wait, but now I'm getting mixed up. The question is whether each symmetry is a must. Wait, another thought: The SMEFT operators are constructed to be renormalizable-like in their symmetry structure. So they have to respect the same symmetry principles as the original Standard Model. So the Standard Model respects Lorentz and Poincare as well as gauge symmetries, but what about the other options?

3. **CP Symmetry (Option 3):** The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in general; in fact, there's CP violation, especially in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can violate CP, but wait, wait. Wait, but when we add operators, they can include terms that change CP properties.
