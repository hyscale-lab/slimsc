Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Alright, first, I should probably start by understanding the problem. So, we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

Wait, right. When you mix two solutions, the total volume is just the sum. So after dilution, the concentration of acetic acid will change. Let me calculate that. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the titration process. Acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll react in a 1:1 mole ratio: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The first part of the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So what's 25% of the equivalence point volume? To find that, I need to find how many moles of NaOH are needed to reach the equivalence point. 

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. The diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH for equivalence is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. 

25% of that volume is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. 

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles of NaOH. That's correct. 

So, in the solution, some of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is 1:1. So moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution: 0.001. Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025. So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution volume now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (2.
