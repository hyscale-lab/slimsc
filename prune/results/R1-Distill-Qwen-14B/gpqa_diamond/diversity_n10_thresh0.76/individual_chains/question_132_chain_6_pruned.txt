Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, let me start by understanding the molecular formula. C10H14. For benzene derivatives, the molecular formula would be C6H6 plus some substituents. So C6H6 has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to C4H8. Because 6 +4 =10, and 6*(2) + 4*2 =14 (wait, C6H6 is 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Adding 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens from substituents would make C10H14. So each substituent would be adding a certain number of carbons and hydrogens. 

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a methyl group. Because methyl is -CH3. So two substituents would add 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Wait, but original is C6H6. So substituents would be 4 carbons. Hmm, wait, maybe each substituent is two methyl groups? No, because 4 substituents each as methyl would be 4 carbons (since each is one C), that makes sense. Because 4 methyl groups on benzene would give C6H6 + 4*(CH3) = C10H14. Because each CH3 adds a C and 3 H's. So 4 CH3 groups would add 4 C and 12 H. So C6H6 + 4CH3 = C10H16? Wait, that can't be right because the formula is C10H14. Oh wait, maybe some substituents are ethyl groups. Because an ethyl is -CH2CH3, which is two carbons and five hydrogens. So perhaps some substituents are ethyl.

Wait, but looking at the options, the available compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes or diethylben
