Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a spin-half particle in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values... I think that's the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So the operator is a combination of σz and σx. I know that σz is the Pauli z-matrix and σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Each of these has eigenvalues for their respective eigenstates. Oh right, for σz, |↑⟩ is +1 and |↓⟩ is -1. For σx, I think the eigenstates are a bit different, but wait, maybe I don't need that right now.

The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state. Since the operator is a sum, I can split the expectation value into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I need to calculate ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for this state, then multiply each by 10 and 5 respectively, and sum them up.

Let's start with σz. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the expectation value should be straightforward. The state is a linear combination: 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and √3/2 for |↓⟩. 

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. The eigenvalue for |↑⟩ is +1, and for |↓⟩ is -1. So:

⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + ( (√3/2)^2 ) * (-1)
Calculating each term:

0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 1 is 0.25.

√3/2 squared is (3/4), multiply by -1 gives -0.75.

So 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. That's a bit trickier because σx's eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it directly using the expectation value formula.

The operator σx is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ψ† σx ψ.

The state ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T because |↑⟩ is the first basis state and |↓⟩ is the second. So the conjugate transpose (bra) would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Alternatively, I can compute it as:

ψ† σx ψ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + sqrt(3)/2*(0.5). Because σx flips the basis, so the off-diagonal terms will involve the cross terms.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So expanding this:

= (0.5)(⟨↑|) + (sqrt(3)/2)(⟨↓|) ) * σx * (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩) )

Because σx is a matrix, when applied to |↑⟩, it becomes |↓⟩ and vice versa. So let's compute each term.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as the sum of terms:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑| σx |↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓| σx |↓⟩.

But I remember that σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Also, the inner product ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ is ⟨↑|↓⟩ which is zero. Similarly, ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ is zero because ⟨↓|↑⟩ is zero. Wait, no. Wait, σx acts on |↓⟩ to give |↑⟩, so ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = ⟨↓| ↑ ⟩? No, wait, σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so when you have σx acting on |↑⟩, then when you take the inner product with ⟨↓|, it's ⟨↓| σx |↑⟩ = ⟨↓| ↓ ⟩ = 1. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↑| σx |↓⟩ is ⟨↑ |
