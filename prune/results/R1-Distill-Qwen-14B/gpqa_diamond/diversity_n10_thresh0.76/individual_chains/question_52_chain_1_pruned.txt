Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it carefully and think it through.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of star spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that starspots are darker, cooler regions on the surface of a star. So when a star has spots, part of its surface is cooler than the rest.

The star's parameters are given: radius 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. Wait, that seems like a big drop. I wonder how effective temperature works here. Oh right, the effective temperature is related to the total luminosity. But when spots cover part of the surface, the observed temperature changes.

The problem focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots versus when there are spots.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k T)). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the ratio being considered is (n1)/(n2) when there are no spots (Teff =6000 K) and when there are spots (Teff=5500 K). The problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = ?

Wait, but the ratio itself is n1/n2. So we'll compute each ratio and take the quotient. Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2). Then R = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

But wait, the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's 1448 angstroms, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but maybe it's just context.

Wait, since the photon emitted corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels, E2 > E1 because the photon is emitted when an electron drops from higher to lower energy. So E2 - E1 = hc/lambda. Or wait, the energy difference is E2 = E1 + hc/lambda. So E2 is higher than E1.

So E1 - E2 would be negative. So the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = - (E2 - E1)/(k T) = - (hc/lambda) / (k T). So the ratio R becomes (g1/g2) * exp( (hc/lambda)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So in our case, E_i is E1 and E_j is E2. So E_i - E_j = E1 - E2 = -(E2 - E1) = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive. So the exponent is (- (-ΔE))/(k T) = ΔE/(k T). So R = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, that depends on whether E1 is higher or lower than E2. Oh wait no, sorry, because when a photon is emitted with wavelength λ, it's because an electron transitions from a higher to a lower energy level. So E2 (upper level) is higher than E1 (lower level). So E1 - E2 = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive. So substituting into the exponent, we get -(E1-E2)/(kT) = ΔE/(kT). So the exponent is positive.

So the ratio R is proportional to exp( ΔE/(k T) ). But since T is changing, this will affect the ratio.

Wait, but the problem states that the ratio R decreases when the star has spots. Which implies that when T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), R goes down. So R is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). Since ΔE is fixed (since the transition wavelength is fixed), when T decreases, the exponent increases because ΔE/(k T) gets larger. So exp(something larger) is larger. So R would increase as T decreases? But the problem says that R decreases when there are spots, which lower T.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let's re-examine.

Wait, no. Let's think about it again. The ratio R is (n1)/(n2). If the temperature of the photosphere decreases, does R increase or decrease?

If T decreases, the denominator in the exponent becomes smaller. Wait, wait, the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k T) = (negative number) / (k T). So the exponent is negative. So exp( negative number ). So as T decreases, (E1-E2)/(k T) = (-ΔE)/(k T) becomes more negative. So exp( more negative ) is a smaller number. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when T is higher, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is larger, so R increases when T increases. So when T decreases, R decreases. Which matches the problem statement. So when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K, so R decreases.

So the ratio R is inversely proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T is higher, R is larger.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1 / R2, where R1 is when no spots (T=6000 K), and R2 is when spots (T=5500 K).

So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
Then R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] )

So the factor is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, more precisely, the exponent is (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (ΔE/k) (1/55
