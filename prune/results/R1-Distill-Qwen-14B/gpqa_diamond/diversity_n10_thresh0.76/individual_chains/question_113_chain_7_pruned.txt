Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the answer is. Let's see what the question is about. It's about identifying an unknown compound using its IR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The question gives me four possible formulas, and I need to pick the right one based on the spectral data provided.

Alright, let's break down the information step by step. First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around there usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid since those tend to have broader O-H stretches compared to alcohols. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but the broadness could also suggest something else.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. What functional groups show peaks around those regions? The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe a carbonyl in an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ketone or an ester.

Wait, if there's a peak at 1650, could it be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Like maybe a benzene ring with substituents that have carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but that's less likely since I don't see any NMR peaks suggesting amide protons.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule probably has an alkene group. So structures with double bonds, maybe something like an ester with an alkene, or a ketone with an alkene nearby.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak
