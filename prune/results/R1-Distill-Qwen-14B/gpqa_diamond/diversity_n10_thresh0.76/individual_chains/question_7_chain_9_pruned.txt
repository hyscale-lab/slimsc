Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. Hmm, I need to figure out which energy level that would be.

Wait, the reaction is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. So, gamma gamma -> e+ e-. I remember that this process is a way for high-energy gamma rays to lose energy. Because the CMB is everywhere, these gamma-rays can interact with CMB photons, and this interaction would limit how long they can travel, hence their lifetime.

The problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. So, each CMB photon has about that energy on average. The gamma-rays are high-energy, so we're talking about gamma-rays with much higher energies than the CMB photons.

I think the key here is to calculate the energy where the interaction rate becomes significant enough to limit the lifetime of the gamma-ray. So, I probably need to use some formula related to interaction cross-sections and the photon density of the CMB.

Wait, the process is pair production, right? Because when a high-energy photon interacts with a lower-energy photon (like a CMB photon), it can produce an electron-positron pair. But for this to happen, the combined energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame needs to be at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron, which is about 1.02 MeV (since the electron mass is ~0.511 MeV each).

Wait, no, the center-of-mass energy squared s must be at least (2m_e c²)^2. So s ≥ (2m_e c²)^2. The rest mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 2m_e c² is about 1.022 MeV.

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Wait, but since the photons are moving in opposite directions (as a head-on collision), their momenta are opposite, so the spatial part would subtract. But in the lab frame, the CMB is isotropic, so maybe we can model the interaction in that frame.

Alternatively, in the rest frame of one of the photons. Wait, let me think. Let’s consider the frame where one photon (the CMB photon) is at rest. Then the other photon (gamma) would have energy E, and the CMB photon would have energy ε. But wait, in the rest frame of the CMB photon, the photon is at rest? No, because photons are massless, they can't be at rest. Hmm, maybe I should think about the frame where the photon from the CMB is moving opposite to the gamma photon.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the center-of-mass energy. The condition for pair production is that the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c². So, maybe I should calculate the minimum energy of the gamma-ray photon required for this to happen when interacting with a CMB photon of energy ε.

The CMB photon has energy ε, and the gamma has energy E. The total energy squared in the center-of-mass frame is (E + ε)^2 - (E c / (f1) )^2 + (ε c / (f2) )^2, but since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Hmm, maybe using the formula for the center-of-mass energy squared, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, photons have E = pc for each. So, for two photons moving in opposite directions, p1 = E1/(c) in one direction, p2 = E2/(c) in the opposite direction. So, the total momentum is p1 - p2 = (E1 - E2)/c.

Wait, no, in reality, the vectors are opposite. So, if I'm in a frame where the gamma is moving to the right, and the CMB photon to the left, then the momenta are opposite. So, in the lab frame, the gamma has momentum p1 = E1/(c), and the CMB photon has p2 = E2/(c), but in the opposite direction. So, the total momentum is p1 - p2 = (E1 - E2)/(c).

So, the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/(c). So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c * c )^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Expanding that: (E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²) - (E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²) = 4 E1 E2.

So, s = 4 E1 E2. And for pair production, we need s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → 4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 ≥ m_e² c^4.

So, E1 * E2 ≥ m_e² c^4.

In this problem, E2 is the energy of the CMB photon, which is given as 1e-3 eV. And E1 is the energy of the gamma-ray photon we're considering.

So, E1 * (1e-3 eV) ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. Wait, 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. So (511,000 eV)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.611e11 (eV)^2.

Then, E1 * (1e-3 eV) ≥ 2.611e11 eV² → E1 ≥ (2.611e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) → E1 ≥ 2.611e14 eV.

Wait, but wait, 1e-3 eV is E2.

Wait, E1 * E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2.

So, E1 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / E2.

E2 is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, let me convert units correctly.

0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV. So, (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 (eV)^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 eV² = 2.61e11 eV².

E2 is 1e-3 eV.

So, E1 ≥ (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) → E1 ≥ 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 TeV. Because 1 TeV is 1e12 eV. Wait,
