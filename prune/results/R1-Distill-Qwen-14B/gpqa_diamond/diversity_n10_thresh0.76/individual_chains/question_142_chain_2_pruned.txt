Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, I remember that the density matrix for a qubit can be represented in a three-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere. Right, the Bloch vector or the point in space corresponds to the parameters of the qubit state.

Density matrices for qubits are 2x2 positive semi-definite matrices with trace 1. The general form is something like ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three dimensions. Oh right, r is the Bloch vector, and its components determine the state's position on the Bloch sphere.

So, for the given ρ, let me expand it. Let's compute each term:

|0⟩⟨0| is the outer product of |0⟩ with itself. That's a diagonal matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the bottom-right and 0 elsewhere.

So adding them together, |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is a 2x2 identity matrix. Because the first term has [1,0;0,0] and the second [0,0;0,1], adding gives [1,0;0,1], which is the identity matrix I.

So ρ is (1/2) * I. Which simplifies to (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Comparing, that would mean (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. So subtracting I/2 from both sides, (r·σ)/2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero, which implies that r is the zero vector.

Hm, so the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the completely mixed state. Because when the density matrix is diagonal and all the off-diagonal terms are zero, that corresponds to no qubit state—wait, no, actually, it's the maximally mixed state. So the qubit isn't pointing in any direction on the Bloch sphere; it's at the origin, which is the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. The density matrix ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So each diagonal term is 1/2. The off-diagonal terms are zero. So it's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. That's the maximally mixed
