Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, so I guess that means they're spread out evenly in some way. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax... right, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax, and one that's farther away has a smaller parallax.

So, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let me think about how the number of stars relates to distance. Since parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by the formula d = 1/p (in parsecs, I think), as p increases, the distance decreases. So closer stars have higher p.

But the stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean uniform in space (like same density everywhere) or uniform on the sky (like same number per unit area)? Or perhaps uniform in some other sense. Oh wait, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, I think that usually when people say stars are uniformly distributed, they mean in space—so their actual positions in 3D space are uniform. But if they're on the sky, it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky," which I think refers to their angular distribution. But maybe the distribution in space is uniform, not on the celestial sphere. Or perhaps it's a translation into the parallax space.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this. Let's consider that the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on the volume they occupy. Because stars are spread uniformly in space, the number of stars in a shell between distances d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars N in that shell would be proportional to r² dr, assuming uniform density.

Now, since parallax p is 1/d (in parsecs), d = 1/p. So, r is d, and dr is the change in distance. Let's express N in terms of p. So, if
