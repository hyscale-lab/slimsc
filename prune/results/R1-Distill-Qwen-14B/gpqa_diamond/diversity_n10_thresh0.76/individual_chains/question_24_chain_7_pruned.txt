Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then think through each part.

So the question says that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture X can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine usually means that the substance has double bonds, right? Because alkenes can react with bromine in a process called addition, which would remove the color from bromine water.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. The key here is that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever is formed in Y must not have any double bonds or maybe they're saturated.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Also, Z is a component of Y and is widely used as a solvent. And importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's already saturated—so it's an alkane.

Wait, so Z is an alkane since it doesn't react with H2. Let's calculate its molecular formula. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So the molecular formula would have H as 1/7 of the total mass. Let me think, for a hydrocarbon, the formula is C_nH_m. The mass of hydrogen is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28.

14.28 is about 1/7, so m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Rearranging: 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m=2n. So m is twice n. So the formula would be C_nH_2n, which is an alkene. Wait, but wait, Z is an alkane? No, wait, wait—no, because if Z is an alkane, H would be 2n+2. Wait, I'm confused now.

Wait the problem says Z is a hydrocarbon, and it doesn't react with hydrogen. So it must be an alkane (saturated). So, then, the formula would be CnH2n+2. So let's recompute the mass fraction.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) ) *100 = (2n+2)/(14n +2)*100 =14.28%. Let's compute:

(2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2n+2 = 0.1428*(14n +2).

Compute RHS: 0.1428 *14n = 1.9992n, and 0.1428 *2 = 0.2856.

So 2n +2 = 1.9992n + 0.2856 → 2n -1.9992n = 0.2856 -2 → 0.0008n ≈ -1.7144. Wait, that can't be right because n can't be negative. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute 14.28% exactly. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 1/7 is 0.142857...

So, (mass of H) / (mass of molecule) = 1/7.

Let me let the molecule be CnHm. The mass of H is m*1, carbon is 12n. So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So H is 2n. So the formula is CnH2n. Wait, that's an alkene, not an alkane. But Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react with hydrogen, implying it's saturated. Hmm, maybe I got this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, which is also saturated. For instance, cyclohexane is C6H12. Let's check its H fraction.

(12)/(78 + 12) = 12/90 = 13.33%, which is close but not exactly 14.28. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait, 14.28% is 1/7. Let me try to find n where m=2n and Z is an alkane.

Wait, but if Z is an alkane, then m=2n+2. So,

(2n+2) / (12n + 2n +2) = 1/7.

So, (2n+2) / (14n +2) = 1/7 → cross multiply:7*(2n+2) =14n +2 →14n +14=14n +2 →14=2. That's impossible. So perhaps Z isn't an alkane but a di-substituted alkene? But then, why wouldn't it react with hydrogen? Because it's already a single double bond? Wait, no, because in that case, adding H2 would hydrogenate it.

Wait, but perhaps Z is something else. Let's try another approach. Let's think about the possible hydrocarbons with 14.28% H.

14.28% is 1/7, so H is 1/7 of the molecule's mass.

So, for a molecule CnHm, m / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m=12n + m →6m=12n→m=2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. So that's an alkene. But earlier, the problem says Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react with H2. But alkenes would react with H2. So perhaps Z is a cyclopropane derivative? Or maybe it's a cyclic compound that doesn
