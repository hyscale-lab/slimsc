Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael reaction and some related organic chemistry concepts. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

The question has three parts, each involving a Michael addition reaction. I need to determine the reactants and major products for each and then match them with the given options A, B, C, D.

First, let me recall what the Michael reaction is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond and results in the formation of an enolate intermediate. The nucleophile usually comes from a compound that can generate an enolate, like a ketone or aldehyde under basic conditions.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, the reagent NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating the alpha position of the malonate ester to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. Its structure is O=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. When treated with a base, like NaOEt, the alpha hydrogens (on the central CH2) are deprotonated, forming a strong nucleophilic enolate ion. The enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon, which can attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituents arranged in the E configuration. Wait, no, wait. The formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH2-(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so positions are 1 and 2 carbons. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group attached to the alpha position? No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tol
