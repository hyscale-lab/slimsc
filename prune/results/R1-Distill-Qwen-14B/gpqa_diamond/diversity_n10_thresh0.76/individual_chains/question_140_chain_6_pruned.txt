Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's start by trying to identify what substance X might be. The reaction with liquid Y produces a gas W where protons equal neutrons. That makes me think of something like H2O2 perhaps, but wait, another thought: Gas W has same number of neutrons and protons per molecule. So, for each molecule of W, the total neutrons equal the total protons. Let's think about possible gases. Maybe H2? No, because H has 0 neutrons. Wait, H2O doesn't fit either. Maybe CO2? No, that's a molecule, but the protons and neutrons wouldn't add up.

Wait, another approach. For a molecule, the sum of protons (which equals the atomic number of each atom) should equal the sum of neutrons (which is mass number minus atomic number for each atom). So, for example, in O2, each O has 8 protons. So for O2, 2 atoms, so total protons is 16. Neutrons per O is 8 (since O is 16, 16-8=8). So each O contributes 8 neutrons, so two O's have 16. So protons (16) equal neutrons (16) in O2. Oh wait, but O2 has a molecule with 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So, that would make W as O2? But O2 is a gas. So maybe W is O2.

Alternatively, maybe another molecule like CH4? No, that's a gas but let's check. CH4 has 4 H's (each 1 proton) and 6 protons from C (since C is 6). So total protons: 6+4=10. Total neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since 12-6=6), and H has 0. So total neutrons: 6. So 10 != 6. Doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think of more possibilities. Another common gas is NH3, but that's a liquid at STP. Maybe CO2? Let's see: CO2 has C (6 protons) and two O's (8 each). Total protons:6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8. So total neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. That's equal! So CO2 would fit. But is CO2 a product of
