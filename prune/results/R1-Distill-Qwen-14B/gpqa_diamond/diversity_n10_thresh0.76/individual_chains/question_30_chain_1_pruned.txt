Okay, so I have this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, the question says that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light corresponds to an electronic transition in the molecule. And the color we see is related to the complementary color of the absorbed light.

So, the energy given is 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find out what wavelength that corresponds to. Oh right, the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, let me get the numbers right. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But since the energy is given in electron volts, maybe I should use the conversion factor that 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. Oh, and sometimes I've seen a shortcut where E (in eV) multiplied by 1240 eV·nm gives the wavelength in nanometers. Because 1240 is approximately hc in eV·nm.

So using E = 1240 / λ, rearranged to λ = 1240 / E. Let me plug in the numbers. E is 2.3393 eV. So
