Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and think through each reaction.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2?), wait no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2, but prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-C=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would be where the double bond starts at C1 and the substituent is at C2. So structure-wise, it's CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 1. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=CH2)- something. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH2?) No, perhaps it's CH2-CH2 with a substituent. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (propen-2-yl), which is isopropenyl, like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Maybe I'm getting the substituent wrong, but perhaps it's easier to note that the group is an allyl group, or maybe an isopropenyl group.

Anyway, the starting compound is a cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, the ring is substituted with hydroxymethyl (position 3) and another group (position 5).

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hy
