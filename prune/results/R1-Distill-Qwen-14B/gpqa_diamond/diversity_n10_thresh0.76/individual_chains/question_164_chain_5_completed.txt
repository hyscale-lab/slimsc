Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So the question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. 

Alright, let's start by reading the problem again. We've got two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, there's spectroscopic data. For system_1, the radial velocity (RV) variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has RV amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s. So each system has two stars, and their velocities vary sinusoidally with those amplitudes.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift as the stars move toward or away from us. The amplitude of their velocity is related to their mass. Oh right, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass.

So, the mass function comes into play here. The formula I remember is something like (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = ( (K1 * P) ) / (2πG) ), but wait maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the mass ratio q is M2/M1, and from the velocity amplitudes, we can find the mass ratio.

Wait, the velocity amplitude of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star is closer to the center of mass, so it moves less. So for each system, the two stars have velocities K1 and K2, such that M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, since their momenta must be equal (they orbit the same center of mass).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So K2 = (M1/M2) * K1. Alternatively, M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, wait, no. Because if M1 is more massive, K1 (its velocity) would be smaller. So let's say M1 is larger than M2. Then K1 < K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So, in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. But wait, which star is which? The amplitudes are for the two stars, so say K1 =10 and K2=5 for system_1.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the two stars in a binary system have velocities in opposite directions, so their velocities would be K1 and K2, but in the same line but opposite signs. So the velocities are such that M1 K1 = M2 K2 because momentum is conserved.

Wait, no, the center of mass requires that M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. But since velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius (v = ω a), so v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So a1/a2 = M2/M1.

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1/a2 = M2/M1.

Then, v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1.

But M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = v1/v2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write this down.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. Let M1 and M2 be their masses. The orbital periods are the same for both. The semi-major axes a1 and a2 are such that a1 + a2 = a (the total separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So, M1 / M2 = a2/a1.

The velocities are v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P.

So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1.

So, M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So, if star 1 has velocity amplitude K1 and star 2 has K2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Therefore, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Wait, that's important. So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's call the stars M1 and M2.

So, M1 has velocity K1 = 10, M2 has K2 =5.

So M1/M2 = K2/K1 =5/10=1/2.

So M2 is twice as massive as M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1(1 + 2) = 3 M1.

Alternatively, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 =2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

If a binary system has two stars, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So, star A with mass M1 is more massive than star B with mass M2. So M1 > M2 → K1 (velocity of M1) < K2 (velocity of M2).

Wait, earlier I thought M1/M2 = K2/K1, but that would imply if K1 is larger, M1 is smaller. Because if K1 is big, M1 is less than M2. Wait, that might make sense. Let's see.

Wait, the formula I think is correct is M1/M2 = (K2/K1).

So, M1 = (K2/K1) * M2.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then M1 is bigger than M2, which makes sense because the more massive star has smaller velocity.

Wait, but in system_1, K1 is 10 and K2 is 5. So K1 is larger than K2. So that would imply that M1 < M2. Because M1/M2 = K2/K1 =5/10=0.5. So M1 is half of M2.

So M1 = 0.5 M2 → M1 is half of M2. So system_1's total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but what about the masses of the two stars? Let me think. Let me denote M1 as the primary (more massive) and M2 as the secondary (less massive), but in this case, K1 is larger than K2. So that would mean the primary has a lower velocity, which fits with the more massive star having a lower velocity.

Wait, no, in system_1, K1 is 10 and K2 is 5. So K1 is larger than K2. Therefore, star 1 (with K1=10) is the one with lower mass. Because M1 = (K2/K1) * M2. So M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So M2 is twice M1.

Wait, but wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because if star 1 has a larger velocity, it's moving more, meaning it's less massive. Because the more massive star would be closer to the center, moving slower. So yes, that makes sense.

So for system_1:

M1 = 0.5 M2 → M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass, M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are K1=15 and K2=10.

So M1/M2 = K2/K1 → M1 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2 → M2 = (3/2) M1.

Total mass M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star is which? Are K1 and K2 the velocities of the same stars as in system_1? Or does each system have its own set? The problem says in system_1, the two stars have 10 and 5. System_2 has 15 and 10.

So perhaps in system_2, K1=15 and K2=10.

So M1/M2 = K2/K1 =10/15=2/3.

So M1 = (2/3) M2 → M2 = (3/2) M1.

Total mass for system_2: M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, each system's total mass would depend on their individual M1 and M2. But I think we need to relate the masses between the two systems.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the mass function for each system.

The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

But wait, I think the formula is f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2 π G ) ), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. But this is only for a single-lined spectroscopic binary, where you can only see one star's velocity.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that both stars have their RVs measured, so it's a double-lined spectroscopic binary. So we can determine the mass ratio.

But perhaps the mass function isn't necessary here because we can find the mass ratio from the velocities.

So, for each system, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Wait, because from earlier, M1/M2 = K2/K1 → M2/M1 = K1/K2 = q.

So for system_1:

q1 = K1_1 / K2_1 = 10 km/s /5 km/s=2.

So q1 = 2 → M2_1 = 2 M1_1.

So M_total_1 = M1_1 + M2_1 = M1_1 + 2 M1_1 = 3 M1_1.

Similarly, for system_2:

q2 = K1_2 / K2_2 =15 /10 = 1.5.

So M2_2 =1.5 M1_2.

M_total_2 = M1_2 + M2_2 = M1_2 + 1.5 M1_2 =2.5 M1_2.

Wait, but how do we compare the total masses of the two systems?

Wait, I think I'm complicating things. Since all the parameters are given, maybe there's a way to find the total mass of each system.

Wait, the mass of the binary system can be determined via Kepler's third law. The formula is:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a^3 ) / (G P² )

But wait, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Alternatively, since the velocity K is related to the semi-major axis and the period.

Wait, for each star, K = (2 π a_i ) / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

But a1 + a2 = a, the total separation.

Also, from M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a1/a2 = M2/M1.

So a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

And a1 + a2 = a.

Substituting a1: (M2/M1) a2 + a2 = a → a2 (M2/M1 + 1) )=a → a2 = a / (1 + M2/M1 )= a M1/(M1 + M2).

Similarly, a1 = (M2/M1) a2 = (M2/M1) * (a M1)/(M1+M2) )= a M2/(M1 + M2).

So, K1 = (2 π a1 )/P = (2 π a M2 )/(P (M1 + M2) )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π a M1 )/(P (M1 + M2) )

So, K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Wait, that brings us back to the initial point. So, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is the inverse of the mass ratio. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q.

So, in system_1, K1=10, K2=5 → K1/K2=2 → q1=2 → M2_1=2 M1_1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10 →15/10=1.5 → q2=1.5 → M2_2=1.5 M1_2.

But to find the total mass, we need to find M1 + M2 for each system.

But how do we relate the masses between the two systems? Because we don't have absolute values, only ratios.

Ah, but wait, the orbital period is given for each system. The period P is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

So perhaps using Kepler's third law to find the total mass.

Wait, but Kepler's law in the form:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/(G P² )

But a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. However, we don't know a for each system. But perhaps we can relate the velocities to a.

Alternatively, since we know the velocities and periods, we can find a for each system.

Wait, Let me think. For each star, the velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P.

So a_i = v P / (2 π )

But a1 + a2 = a, the total separation. So a = a1 + a2.

So a = (v1 P )/(2 π ) + (v2 P )/(2 π ) = (P/(2 π ))(v1 + v2 )

Substituting this into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² a^3 )/( G P² )

Substitute a:

a = (P (v1 + v2 )) / (2 π )

So a^3 = [ P (v1 + v2 )/(2 π ) ]^3

Substitute into M_total:

M_total = [4 π² * (P (v1 + v2 )/(2 π ))^3 ] / (G P² ) 

Let's compute this.

Compute numerator:

4 π² * ( P^3 (v1 +v2 )^3 ) / ( (2 π )^3 )

Denominator: G P²

So M_total = [4 π² * P^3 (v1 +v2 )^3 / (8 π^3 ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify:

= [4 π² * P^3 (v1 +v2 )^3 ] / (8 π^3 G P² )

= [ (4/8) * (π²/π^3 ) * P^3 / P² * (v1 +v2 )^3 ] / G

Simplify each term:

4/8 = 0.5

π² / π^3 = 1/π

P^3 / P² = P

So,

= [ 0.5 * (1/π ) * P * (v1 +v2 )^3 ] / G

= [ (P (v1 +v2 )^3 ) / ( 2 π G ) ]

So,

M_total = (P (v1 +v2 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

Wait, that's the formula for the total mass in terms of the period and the sum of the velocity amplitudes.

So for each system, we can compute M_total.

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. Let me double-check.

Wait, velocities are in km/s, period in years. We need to convert everything into SI units (meters, seconds) to make sure the calculation works.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to compute the ratio of the masses without getting into units.

Because the question is about the ratio of the masses, perhaps I can compute M1_total / M2_total.

So, M_total is proportional to P (v1 +v2 )^3.

Wait, M_total is proportional to P (v1 +v2 )^3.

Because G is a constant, 2 and π are constants. So when comparing two systems, their M_total ratio would be (P1 (v1_1 +v2_1 )^3 ) / ( P2 (v1_2 +v2_2 )^3 )

So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is:

Factor = (M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = [ P1 (v1_1 +v2_1 )^3 ] / [ P2 (v1_2 +v2_2 )^3 ]

Because M_total is proportional to this quantity.

So let's compute each part.

System_1: P1 = 2 years, v1_1=10 km/s, v2_1=5 km/s → sum is 15 km/s.

System_2: P2=1 year, v1_2=15 km/s, v2_2=10 km/s → sum is 25 km/s.

So, Factor = (2 * (15)^3 ) / (1 * (25)^3 ) )

Compute this:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 = 15625

So,

Factor = (2 * 3375) / 15625 = (6750) / 15625.

Compute 6750/15625.

Well, let's see.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25:

6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

270/625.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 54/125.

54 divided by 125: 0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.432.

Wait, but this is M_total_1 / M_total_2.

So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, no, wait. Because the question is by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So if Factor is 0.432, that would mean system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive.

But looking at the options, options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.432 is approximately 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the formula I derived was M_total = (P (v1 +v2 )^3 ) / (2 π G )

But when taking the ratio, the constants (2 π G) cancel out, so M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 (v1_1 + v2_1 )^3 ] / [ P2 (v1_2 +v2_2 )^3 ].

Which is correct.

So plugging the numbers:

P1=2, sum_v1=15.

P2=1, sum_v2=25.

Factor = (2 * 15^3 ) / (1 *25^3 ) = (2*3375)/(15625) = 6750/15625 = 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive by a factor of about 2.315.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

If 0.432 is the factor, that would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4.

But the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is 0.4 times as massive, then system_1 is 0.4 times more massive, which actually means it's less massive.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The factor is 0.432. So M_total_1 = 0.432 * M_total_2.

So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.43.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If it's less, then the factor would be less than 1. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because M_total_1 = (2 * (15)^3 ) / (2 pi G ), and M_total_2 = (1 * (25)^3 ) / (2 pi G )

So M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (2 * 3375 ) / (1 * 15625 )= 6750/15625=0.432.

So M_total_1 is 0.432 times M_total_2. So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question is "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio the other way. Maybe I mixed up M1 and M2.

Wait no, the formula correctly computes M_total_1 as proportional to P*(sum_v)^3.

So if the factor is 0.432, system_1's mass is 0.432 times system_2's. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question is, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the factor is less than 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait. Let me just make sure I haven't confused the two systems.

Wait, system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 of 1 year.

Wait, but M_total is proportional to P*(sum_v)^3.

So for system_1:

sum_v =10+5=15.

P=2.

So numerator: 2*(15)^3.

System_2: sum_v=15+10=25, P=1. So denominator:1*(25)^3.

So the ratio is (2*3375)/(1*15625)= 6750/15625= 0.432.

So M_total_1 is 0.432 times M_total_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So if the factor is 0.43, it's about 0.4 times as massive, meaning system_1 is less massive.

Hmm, but the options are about factors by which system_1 is more massive. If the factor is 0.4, that would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2, so it's actually less massive. So the correct answer would be that system_2 is more massive than system_1 by a factor of 1/0.432≈2.315. But the question is about system_1 being more massive than system_2.

But according to the calculation, system_1 is less massive, so the factor is about 0.43, but that would mean system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So which option is that? Option A is ~0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made an inversion. Let me re-look at the formula.

I think the formula is correct. So the factor is 0.432, which would imply that system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

So system_1 is less massive, but the question is phrased the other way.

Hmm, but the question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, then the factor is 0.43. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

So the answer is option A, ~0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the ratio. Let me recompute.

Factor= [P1*(v1+v2)_1^3 ] / [P2*(v1+v2)_2^3 ]

P1=2, sum_v1=15.

P2=1, sum_v2=25.

So (2 * 15^3 ) / (1 *25^3 )

15^3=3375, 25^3=15625.

So 2 *3375=6750.

6750 /15625= (6750 ÷ 25) =270; 15625 ÷25=625.

So 270 /625= 0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.432, so option A is ~0.4.

So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So the answer is A.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the relationship derived from Kepler's third law and the given data. The total mass of a binary system is proportional to:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto P \cdot (v_1 + v_2)^3
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(v_1 + v_2\) is the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars in the system.

### System_1:
- Orbital period, \(P_1 = 2\) years.
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s}\).
- Total velocity sum: \(v_1 + v_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\).

### System_2:
- Orbital period, \(P_2 = 1\) year.
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(v_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(v_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s}\).
- Total velocity sum: \(v_1 + v_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\).

The ratio of the total masses of the two systems is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{P_1 \cdot (v_1 + v_2)_1^3}{P_2 \cdot (v_1 + v_2)_2^3}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{2 \cdot (15)^3}{1 \cdot (25)^3}
\]

First, calculate the cubes:
\[
15^3 = 3375, \quad 25^3 = 15625
\]

Now compute the ratio:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{2 \cdot 3375}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

Thus, system_1 is approximately **0.432 times as massive as system_2**. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately **0.4**.

### Final Answer:
**A) ~0.4**
