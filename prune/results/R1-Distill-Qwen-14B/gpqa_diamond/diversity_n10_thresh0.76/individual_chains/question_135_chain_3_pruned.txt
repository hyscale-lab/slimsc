Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by some Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Let me parse it. Oh, I think it's supposed to be something like the boson X interacting with a fermion ψ_f. So the interaction term would probably be something like λ X ψ_f^† ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. But maybe the exact form isn't crucial for determining the decay products.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So we're looking at which fermions it can decay into. The question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Kinematic allowance for a particle decay depends on conservation laws and energy. For a boson (like X) decaying into two fermions, each fermion will have some mass. The key thing is that the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Otherwise, the decay isn't possible.

Wait, but actually, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions (like f and anti-f), each fermion's rest mass must be less than half the mass of X. Because each would get half the energy in the center of mass frame, assuming they're produced at rest. So the maximum mass for each would be M_X / 2. Because if each has mass m, then m ≤ M_X / 2. So if M_X is 6 GeV, each fermion's mass must be ≤3 GeV.

Let me list the masses of known fermions:

- Electron (e): negligible, like ~0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV (0.002 GeV), but in models, sometimes considered heavier. Wait, but in the Standard Model, the up quark is very light.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 5 MeV (0.005 GeV).
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV).
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV.
- Top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV.

Hmm, wait, but the X boson mass is 6 GeV. So each decay product's mass must be ≤3 GeV.

So looking at the fermion masses:

- e, μ, τ: electrons and muons are way below 3 GeV. Taus are 1.78 GeV, so that's okay. So X could decay into τ+ τ-.

- Quarks: Let's see. Up
