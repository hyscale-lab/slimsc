Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

So, there's this intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super-fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast—close to the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years, which is 150 Earth years. So their lifespan is pretty long, but not super long. Now, they're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective. The options are whether the astronaut will die before getting there or a time in years.

Hmm, this seems like a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs—meaning that time passes more slowly for the traveler compared to someone stationary relative to the destination.

Wait, wait. But wait, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old. We need to find out, from the astronaut's point of view, how long the trip takes, right?

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I remember that the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. It's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me confirm that. Oh right, the average distance is about 163,000 light-years. So that's the distance the spaceship has to cover.

But wait, the astronaut is traveling at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's frame of reference, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So that would be 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Let's calculate that.

Wait, a light-year is the distance light travels in a year. So speed is c, so time is (distance in light-years) / (speed in terms of c). So, t = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / 1, since 0.99
