Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cosmology and redshifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. But wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is actually in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh right, because Lyman alpha is a transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second to the first energy level, and that emits a photon at around 121.6 nm, which is 121.6 Angstroms. Wait, wait, the question says 1216 Angstromsâ€”did I get that right? Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me double-check: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms would be 121.6 nm. Yeah, that's correct. So that's the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha emission.

But wait, the question is about absorption. So when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs that light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But the quasar is a distant object, so the light we observe from it is redshifted. The absorption line also gets redshifted by the same factor as the quasar's light.

The problem is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshifted Lyman alpha wavelength must be less than or equal to around 700 nm.

Wait, no, optical telescopes can detect light in the visible range. But if the redshifted Lyman alpha is in the visible, then we can observe it. So the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. Let me calculate the redshift z needed so that 121.6 nm * (1+z) is equal to the maximum wavelength detectable in optical, which is about 700 nm (or 7000 Angstrom
