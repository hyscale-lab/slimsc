Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about nuclear fission. An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments, and nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.

We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. So, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

And since one fragment is more massive than the other, their velocities will be different. Wait, but the problem is about their kinetic energies, so I think I'll need to compute their velocities or their kinetic energies somehow.

But wait, the problem is about the difference between the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations of T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

So, I think I need to compute T1 both relativistically and classically, then find their difference.

Let me start by figuring out the masses of the two fragments.

Given that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99M. Also, one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2, with m2 = 2m1.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m2 = 2m1, we get m1 + 2m1 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M.

So, m1 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M.

Then, m2 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. So the initial rest mass is M. The rest masses of the fragments sum to 0.99M
