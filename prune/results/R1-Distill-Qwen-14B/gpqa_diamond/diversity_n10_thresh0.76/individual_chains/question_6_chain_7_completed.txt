Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The problem states that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in such problems, especially with potentials depending on r and θ, we might need to use polar coordinates. Oh yeah, because the potential is given in terms of r and angle θ, so it's probably easier to work in polar coordinates.

Wait, I think the potential can be rewritten to see if it resembles any known form. Let's factor out the r². So V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Hmm, perhaps we can separate the angular part. Because in such cases, when the potential allows separation of variables, the energy levels can be determined by solving the radial and angular parts separately.

Wait, but I also recall that in two dimensions, the energy levels for a particle in a potential like V(r) = (1/2)m ω² r² would be similar to the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but adjusted for two dimensions. Oh wait, actually, the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels En = (n_x + n_y +1) ℏω, where n_x and n_y are quantum numbers. But wait, wait, that's for when the potential is symmetric in all directions, which is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r².

But in this problem, the potential isn't isotropic because it has that cos²θ term. So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think about how this affects the system.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it breaks into something more manageable. Because in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cos²θ = (x²)/(r²). So then, let me try that.

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². But wait, r² is x² + y², so substituting back, this becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me combine the terms: (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y². Because (1/2)k(x² + y²) is (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²), and adding (3/2 k x²) gives us (2 k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, so V(x,y) = (2 k x²) + (1/2 k y²). Oh, that's interesting. So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two terms: one in x² and another in y², but with different coefficients. That suggests that the system can be considered as two independent harmonic oscillators, one along the x-axis and another along the y-axis, but with different frequencies.

Wait, because each direction has its own potential, and the kinetic energy terms are also split into x and y parts. So the Hamiltonian would be H = (p_x²)/(2m) + (p_y²)/(2m) + 2 k x² + (1/2) k y². Hmm, but wait, the coefficients in front of x² and y² are different. Let me think about the standard harmonic oscillator potential, which is (1/2) m ω² x². So here, for the x-direction, the term is 2k x², which would be equivalent to (1/2) m ω_1² x², where ω_1² = (4k)/m. Because 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_1² x² → ω_1² = 4k/m → ω_1 = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly for the y-direction: (1/2)k y² is the standard form, so (1/2) m ω_2² y², so ω_2² = k/m → ω_2 = sqrt(k/m).

So the x and y directions have different frequencies. Then, the energy levels are determined by each direction's oscillator.

Wait, but in each direction, the energy levels are quantized. For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

So in the x-direction, the frequency is 2 sqrt(k/m), so ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). So the energy for the x part is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)).

Similarly, for the y-direction, ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so the energy for the y part is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Adding these together, the total energy E is the sum of the x and y parts.

So E_total = (n_x + 1/2) (2 ℏ sqrt(k/m)) ) + (n_y + 1/2) (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Let me expand this: 2(n_x + 1/2) sqrt(k/m) ℏ * (1/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2 sqrt(k/m) is equal to 2 * sqrt(k/m), so let me write this as:

E_total = [2 (n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, because 2 sqrt(k/m) is 2 times sqrt(k/m), so the x part is 2 (n_x + 1/2) times (ℏ sqrt(k/m)), and the y part is (n_y + 1/2) times (ℏ sqrt(k/m)). So adding them:

E_total = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me distribute the terms inside the brackets: 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Hmm, now I look at the options given:

Option C says E = (2n_x + n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ√(k/m)

Yes, that's exactly what we got.

So the energy spectrum is given by option C.


To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \), we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Rewriting the Potential**: The potential is rewritten in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting these, the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]

2. **Separation of Variables**: The potential separates into contributions along the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]
   This corresponds to two independent harmonic oscillators with different frequencies.

3. **Energy Levels in Each Direction**:
   - For the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2kx^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right).
     \]
   - For the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), which corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

4. **Total Energy**: The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + 1\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   Combining terms:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**: Comparing this result with the given options, the correct energy spectrum is:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   This matches **Option C**.
