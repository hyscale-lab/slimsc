Okay, so I've got this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me recall what each of these symmetries means.

Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. So the theory should look the same to all observers regardless of their constant velocity relative to each other. I remember that SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model does respect Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must too. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a yes.

Wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So it's a bigger symmetry group. If a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT have to respect Poincare? I think the Standard Model does because it's a relativistic theory. SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, so maybe Poincare is also a symmetry. So option 2, Poincare, must be respected.

Next is CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles to their antiparticles, and parity is spatial inversion. The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric, right? Because processes like certain kaon decays violate CP. So if the Standard Model doesn't respect CP, then SMEFT operators might include terms that violate CP. Wait, but when building operators in SMEFT, do they have to maintain CP symmetry, or can they include operators that break it? I think in SMEFT, the operators can have various CP properties. The theory itself doesn't require all operators to respect CP symmetry; it's more that the operators are organized according to their quantum numbers, including CP. So maybe not all operators respect CP. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry. C is charge conjugation, P is parity, and T is time reversal. The CPT theorem states that the combination of these three must be a symmetry in any quantum field theory that respects certain conditions, like Lorentz symmetry and locality. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, then CPT should be a symmetry. Wait, but does the SMEFT necessarily respect CPT? Because all the operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields and their derivatives, and the SM itself respects CPT. So any operator in SMEFT should also preserve CPT symmetry. So
