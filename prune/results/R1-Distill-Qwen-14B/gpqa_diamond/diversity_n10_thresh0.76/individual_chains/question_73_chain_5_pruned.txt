Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity. Let me think.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtraction. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, which astronaut's frame are we considering? Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference in their velocities, but adjusted for relativity.

The velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, no, that's for when you're finding the velocity of one object as seen from another. So if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²) if they're moving in the same direction.

Wait, but in this problem, who is the observer? I think the question is asking for the relative speed between them, so perhaps using the frame where one is stationary. Wait no, the problem states both are moving in the positive x-direction. So maybe from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the speed of the other?

Wait, but the problem might just be asking for the relative speed, perhaps the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me think. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

So using the formula: u' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c² )

Wait, wait. Wait, in relativity, when you have two velocities u and v, the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when u and v are in the same direction. Wait, no, I get confused. Let me get it right. The formula is for when you have two frames moving at velocity v relative to each other, and an object is moving at u in the first frame, then in the second frame it's u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²).

So in this case, astronaut A is in a frame where he's stationary, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, but wait no, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me calculate that. 0.5c - 0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (-0.1c)/0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. But the negative sign indicates direction. Since speed is the magnitude, it's 0.1428c. Wait, but the options have 0.14c as an option. So maybe that's the relative speed. But let me check: 0.1428 is approximately 0.143, so 0.14c is close. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Wait, but another thing: could it be the other way around? Like, if we take B as the observer and find A's speed relative to him. So from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.1428c. So same result. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, so options C and D have that.

Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So each has energy gamma * m c². So for each, calculate gamma and then sum.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut, v=0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of first astronaut E1 = 2m * gamma1 c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait no, wait. The formula is E = gamma * m c². So for the first, mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approx 1.1547.

So E2 = 3m * 1.15
