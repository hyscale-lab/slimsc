Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is asking how many of the listed stars would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I need to figure out what factors determine if a star is detectable by ESPRESSO. I think it has to do with the brightness of the star, right? Because if a star is too dim, the S/N would be too low.

ESPRESSO's performance is probably linked to the magnitude of the star. I seem to recall that ESPRESSO can reach a certain limit in magnitude. Let me think. Oh wait, I think ESPRESSO is designed to work best with brighter stars, maybe down to about magnitude 10 or so? Or was it a bit fainter? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Alternatively, I should look for a way to calculate the S/N based on the star's properties.

The question gives several stars with varying distances and absolute magnitudes. The formula I remember for calculating apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. So for each star, I can compute their apparent magnitude (m) and then determine if that's bright enough for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N.

Wait, but how does the S/N relate to the star's magnitude? I think that's where the instrument's sensitivity comes into play. I remember that the S/N ratio is inversely related to the star's magnitude. The formula, perhaps, is something like S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude where S/N is 1, and t is the exposure time in seconds. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, ESPRESSO's design might be such that it can achieve a certain S/N per second for a given star magnitude. Let me think about the parameters. I think ESPRESSO is optimized for bright stars, maybe down to around magnitude 10, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says a 1-hour exposure, which is 3600 seconds. So the S/N per binned pixel is at least 10. So each star's apparent magnitude will determine whether it's bright enough for this S/N.

Let me list out the stars and compute their apparent magnitudes.

Star a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, I believe. That’s way brighter than most stars.

Star b) Polaris. I think Polaris is about magnitude 1.97 or something like that. So also quite bright.

Star c) Absolute V magnitude 15, at 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 + 5 log10(10). Wait, log10(10) is 1. So m =15 +5 +5(1) = 25. So m=25.

Star d) Same absolute magnitude 15, but at 200 pc. So m=15 +5 +5 log10(200). Log10(200)=log10(2e2)=log10(2)+2≈0.301+2=2.301. So 15+5=20, plus 5*2.301=11.505. So m=31.505.

Star e) Absolute mag 15, 5 pc. m=15 +5 +5 log10(5). Log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897=3.495. So m=15+5=20 +3.495=23.495.

Star f) 15 mag, 50 pc. m=15+5 +5 log10(50). Log10(50)=1.69897. 5 *1.69897≈8.4949. So m=15+5=20 +8.4949=28.4949.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: m≈-0.7 (very bright)
b) Polaris: m≈1.97 (bright)
c) m=25
d) m≈31.5
e) m≈23.5
f) m≈28.5

Now, I need to find out for each star if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during 1 hour.

But how does the S/N relate to the magnitude?

I think the S/N per exposure time t is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m_0)) * sqrt(t),

where m_0 is the reference magnitude. Alternatively, another approach is that the number of photons collected depends on the star's flux, which is related to its magnitude.

Wait, another approach: the signal in a spectrograph is proportional to the square root of the number of photons, which depends on the star's brightness. The noise is typically the square root of the signal plus background,
