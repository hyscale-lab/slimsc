Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so maybe it's not normalized yet. Oh right, because the coefficients might not sum to 1 in norm. So I'll probably need to normalize it first before finding probabilities.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator A. The matrix A has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. Wait, so A is a 2x2 matrix?

Wait, since it's an operator on spin, which is two-level, the matrix is 2x2. So for a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of A would be the basis we need to express |alpha> in. Because when you measure in the eigenbasis of the operator, the probability is the square of the amplitude.

But wait, no, wait. Let me think. The operator A is given with A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i≠j, the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. A_ij is zero when i = j, and ħ/2 otherwise. So if it's a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. That looks similar to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A is (ħ/2) times σ_x.

Wait, because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. Because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis. These states are superpositions of |up> and |down> in the z-basis.

So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or maybe I have the signs backwards, but that's the general idea.

Wait, but the problem is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A. So we need to expand |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. But wait, the question says "each of the eigenstates of the operator", so for each eigenstate, find the probability.

So first, I think I need to find the normalized |alpha> state. Let's see, the given state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Oh wait, because |a|² + |b|² for a state a|up> + b|down>, assuming |up> and |down> are orthogonal and normalized.

So |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2 (because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2). Similarly, |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So total is 2 +5=7. So
