Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the question. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options (A to D), each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired compound with high yield.

First, I'll draw the structure of the target molecule. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the numbering. Let me count again. I think the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, but the numbering might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1, 2, 3 have substituents in that order. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the numbering depends on the substituents. The lowest possible numbers are assigned. So, substituents are ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). The numbering should start such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are adjacent. Let me think: 1,2,3 would imply they are in a row. So the substituents are next to each other. Hmm.

Now, the synthesis steps. Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent and how they would influence the incoming groups.

Benzene is the starting material. The first step would probably be to introduce one of the substituents. Let's see the substituents we have: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Nitro is a strong meta director, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky substituent that's an ortho/para director but due to its bulk, more para directing.

Wait, but the order of introduction matters. Because each substituent's position affects where the next substituent can go.

Let me think about the order. Each nitration, alkylation, etc., will introduce substituents in specific positions relative to existing groups.

Let me outline the synthesis steps. We need to introduce three substituents: OEt (ethoxy), t-Bu (tert-butyl), and NO2 (nitro). The order in which they are introduced will determine the positions.

Suppose we start with benzene. Let's first introduce a nitro group. Nitro is a meta-directing group. But wait, if we
