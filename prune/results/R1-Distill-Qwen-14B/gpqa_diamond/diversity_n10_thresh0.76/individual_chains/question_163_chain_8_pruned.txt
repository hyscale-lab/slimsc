Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says. Okay, the question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a volume and a pH.

Hmm, okay. I think I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. So when it reacts with a strong acid, it should form Fe³+ ions and water. Right, the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense because the H+ from the acid would neutralize the OH- from the Fe(OH)3.

First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) → 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles.

Wait, wait, that's 9.36e-4 moles. Right, because 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

Now, since Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, each mole provides three moles of OH- ions. But when it reacts with H+, it will take three H+ ions for each mole of Fe(OH)3. So, the reaction is 1:3 for Fe(OH)3 to H+. So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, moles H+ required = 3 * 0.000936 mol ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, so the volume needed can be found using the formula: Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranging, volume = moles / Molarity. So, volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 28.08 exactly. Let's check the options again.

Option C is 28.05 cm³, pH 2.04. Hmm, that's very close. So wait, maybe I made a slight error in calculations. Let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16+1). So 3 OH groups would be 51. So total is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = 0.0009359 moles. So, 0.0009359 *3 = 0.0028077 mol H+ needed. So, 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 L, which is 28.077 cm³, so approx 28.08 cm³. So the closest option is C, which says 28.05 cm³. Maybe I should be more precise with the molar mass?

Wait, perhaps I should use exact molar masses. Let me compute it again precisely.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

Each OH group: O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So OH is 17.008 g/mol. So three OH groups make 3 *17.008 = 51.024 g/mol.

So total molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 +5
