Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is specifically for ring-closing metathesis, but wait, no, it can also do cross metathesis. Oh right, it's a transition metal catalyst, typically for olefin metathesis in general.

So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. 3-methyl means a methyl group is attached to C3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So with a methyl on C3, that would make it CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 1, 2, 3. So the structure should be CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene: Position 1 is double bond, position 3 has a methyl.

Wait, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, that's hexene. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons again for 3-methylpent-1-ene. The main chain is pentene, so five carbons with a double bond at position 1. The substituent is a methyl on carbon 3.

So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but that would
