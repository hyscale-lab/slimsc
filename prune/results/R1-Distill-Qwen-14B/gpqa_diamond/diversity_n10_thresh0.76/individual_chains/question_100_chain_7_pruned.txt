Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6. Alternatively, it could be cyclopropane, but I think propene is more likely here since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, which is a typical addition reaction for alkenes.

Alright, step one: Compound A (propene) undergoes bromination with CCl4. So bromination of propene would be an addition reaction. Propene has a double bond between C1 and C2. When bromine is added, it would add across the double bond. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so we'd get BrCH2CHBrCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propene is actually CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond, leading to 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is likely an elimination reaction. So when a dibromide is treated with a strong base like KOH in alcohol, it'll undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. The dibromide is 1,2-dibromopropane. When two bromines are on adjacent carbons, the base will eliminate HBr from each adjacent carbon, forming a double bond. So the product would be propene again? Wait, but wait, the starting material was propene, and adding Br2 gives a 1,2-dibromide. Then elimination would give back propene. Hmm, but wait, maybe the initial addition could have other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps the bromination leads to a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is cyclopropane, then the bromination would add Br2 across the ring to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane. Then
