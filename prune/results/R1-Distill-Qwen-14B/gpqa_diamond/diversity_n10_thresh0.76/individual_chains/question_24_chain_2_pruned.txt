Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids due to a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they both give the same substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and it's a solvent commonly used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated. Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds in mixture X.

Hmm. Let me try to figure out what's happening here.

So, the first thing I'm thinking is that mixture X must contain compounds that can react in a way that removes bromine from bromine water. That makes me think of alkenes or alkynes because they can decolorize bromine water via addition reactions. But if X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each is an alkene or alkyne, or maybe one is an alkene and the other a diene or something else.

But wait, the mixture Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation usually involves a single element being both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, oxygen is both gaining and losing electrons. So, maybe one of the compounds in X is undergoing disproportionation.

After the reaction, mixture Y is formed, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever is in Y doesn't have double bonds or triple bonds that can react with bromine. So Y probably contains only single bonds, like alkanes, or maybe some other structures that don't react with Br2.

When both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give the same product Z. That suggests that the starting materials in X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, produce the same alkane. Because in hydrogenation, alkenes and alkynes add hydrogen to become alkanes. So perhaps X and Y are different unsaturated compounds that, upon hydrogenation, produce the same saturated hydrocarbon Z.

Moreover, Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate that. The mass percent is (mass of H / molar mass) * 100. Let's let Z be CnH2m. Wait, no, because when you hydrogenate, maybe it's turning into a more saturated molecule. Maybe Z is an alkane, which would have the formula CnH2n+2. Let me think.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Because 14.28 is roughly 100/7 which is about 14.2857%. So, the mass of hydrogen is 1/7 of the molar mass of Z.

So if the molar mass of Z is M, then (mass H) = (
