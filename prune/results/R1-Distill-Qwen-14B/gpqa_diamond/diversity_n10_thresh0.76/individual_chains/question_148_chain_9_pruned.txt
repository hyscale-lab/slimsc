Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five of these compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm, let's break down each part.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction might look something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, that makes sense.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but if A1 is causing it to oxidize, that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a fluoride with a high oxidation state, like a peroxide or something else?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. A1 is a binary compound, so it's Y and F. Since it's a binary compound with fluorine, and it's a strong oxidizer, perhaps it's a high-valent Y fluoride. Wait, but fluorine is typically in a -1 oxidation state. So perhaps Y is in a higher positive oxidation state.

Wait, but when A1 decomposes, it's producing A2 and F2. Let's think about the decomposition. Suppose A1 is YF_x, and upon decomposition, it forms A2 and F2. So the decomposition could be something like 2 YF3 → Y2F6 + F2? Wait, wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe it's a fluorine-rich compound.

Wait, but the problem says that in the decomposition, ɷF is 31.96%. Wait, ɷF is the atomic weight fraction of fluorine in A2. So, the formula of A2 would have fluorine at about 31.96% by mass.

Wait, fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19 g/mol. So let's do a quick calculation. Let's say the molar mass of A2 is M, and the
