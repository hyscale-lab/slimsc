Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

So, the question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So I think I need to apply some kind of relativity here.

Wait, so the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Oh, but wait, the light beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving along with it.

Wait, no. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer, does that mean the beam is approaching the observer? So the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is moving toward the observer. So the beam is coming towards the observer, and the glass is moving along with the beam.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving in the same direction. But the beam is towards the observer. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is moving toward the observer, same direction, but the glass is moving along with the beam.

Wait, perhaps the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is also moving toward the observer, so same direction. So the glass is in front, moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving through the glass, also towards the observer.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let
