Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, so this must be related to spin Hamiltonians.

Wait, the Pauli vector σ is made up of the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. And when you take the dot product with n, which is a unit vector, it's like σ · n = n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of these Pauli matrices scaled by ε and the components of n.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination can be found using the expectation value or maybe the trace and determinant. But wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you combine them with coefficients, the eigenvalues might change.

Wait, another approach: for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are trace over 2 and negative that, or something. Or wait, the general formula for the eigenvalues of a matrix like a·σ, where a is a vector, is that the eigenvalues are ±|a|. Hmm, but wait, let me think. The matrix σ · n is a dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. Since n is a unit vector, σ·n is a traceless matrix because each Pauli matrix is traceless, and any linear combination would also be traceless. So the trace is zero, which means the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of σ·n: I think for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (eigenvalue1)(eigenvalue2) = determinant. So for σ·n, each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but when you take a linear combination... Wait, maybe it's better to compute (σ·n)^2. Let me see: (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. When you square that, you get n_x^2 σx² + n_y^2 σy² + n_z^2 σz² plus cross terms like n_x n_y
