Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but I'll take it one step at a time.

First, let me try to understand the starting materials and each reaction step. The first part says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, so the starting material is a bicyclic compound. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene—that's norbornene, right? So the structure is norbornene with a tert-butoxy group attached.

The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That's a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So each of those has two bromines on a methyl group attached to the ring.

Sodium iodide and elevated temperature. Oh, wait, this sounds like an elimination reaction. Maybe dehydrohalogenation or some kind of coupling? Alternatively, since there are dienes involved, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, but the starting material is norbornene, which is a diene. The other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those positions has a dibromomethyl group. So maybe the norbornene (the diene) is reacting with the dienophile part of the other molecule.

Wait, but each of the other molecule's substituents is a dibromomethyl group. If the starting material is a diene, perhaps it's undergoing a cycloaddition with the other dienophile? Or maybe elimination of the dibromomethyl groups to form a dienophile.

Wait, another thought: when you have dibromomethyl groups, and you have conditions that favor elimination, like NaI and heat, perhaps the bromides are leaving, leading to formation of alkenes. So each dibromomethyl group (like CH2Br2) would lose HBr twice, forming a double bond. So each of those positions would form a CH2 that becomes CH2→CH2 with a double bond? Wait, no. If it's CH2Br2, and you eliminate two HBr molecules, you would form a double bond. So CH2Br2 would become CH2 after losing two HBr, but wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe each group is (CH2Br)2, so each substituent is a methyl group with two bromines attached. So each is like Br2C-CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. The molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Then positions 5 and 6 each have a -CH2- group, but each of those CH2 groups is substituted with two bromines. So each is actually (CH2Br2), but that can't be right because a methyl group can't have two bromines on the same carbon if it's CH2. Oh wait, wait, no. The substituent is dibromomethyl, which would be -CH2Br2? Or is it -CBr2H? Wait, no, dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. Wait, no, because CH2Br2 would be a methyl group with two bromines on the central carbon. So each of those substituents is a CH2 group with two Br atoms attached. So each substituent is CH2Br2.

When NaI is present at elevated temperature, perhaps the bromides undergo elimination. So each CH2Br2 group
