Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to visualize each reaction.

The question starts with the compound 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me draw that structure. So cyclohexanone ring, with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. The prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached at the 5 position. So, it's cyclohexanone with those substituents.

The first step is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds. In the presence of benzyl bromide, which is an alkylating agent, I think this is an alkylation reaction. So, where would the deprotonation occur?

The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The hydroxyl group can be deprotonated by NaH to form an alkoxide. That alkoxide is a good nucleophile and can attack the benzyl bromide. So, the benzyl group (C6H5CH2-) would attach to the oxygen, replacing the H from the hydroxide. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether.

So after the first step, product 1 would have a benzyl group attached via an oxygen to the cyclohexanone ring at position 3. So, the structure would be 3-(benzyloxy)methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Next step: treating product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic HCl. I remember that p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) group is often used as a good leaving group. The hydrazide part suggests this is a Curtius or Hofmann rearrangement, but wait, when you have a ketone and treat it with hydrazine derivatives, it forms a hydrazone.

Wait, but wait. p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used in the formation of a hydrazone. So, the ketone (cyclohexanone) would react with the hydrazide. The reaction is: ketone + hydrazide â†’ ketone hydrazone.

But wait, the presence of HCl as a catalyst... Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution? No, probably the formation of a hydrazone. So product 2 would be the hydrazone of the cyclohexanone.

The hydrazone formation would convert the ketone into an imine-like structure. So the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a C=N-NH-Ts group, where Ts is the tosyl group. So the cyclohexanone ring now has a hydrazone substituent at position 1.

Moving on, product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride. n-BuLi is a strong base and a good nucleophile. It's often used in deprotonation or conjugate additions.

In the case of a hydrazone, which is a good electrophile, perhaps the BuLi abstracts a proton. But wait, where's a good proton to abstract? Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition. Hydrazones can undergo 1,2-addition or 1,4-addition. Since BuLi is strong, maybe it adds to the carbonyl group after deprotonation.

Wait, the hydrazone structure is R-C=N-NH-Ts. If BuLi is added, maybe it deprotonates the hydrazone to form an enolate? Or perhaps, the hydrazone is a good enough leaving group to undergo elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another possibility: in the presence of BuLi, the hydrazone might undergo aminolysis. Wait, BuLi is a strong base and can deprotonate. Let me think about the structure. The hydrazone is at position 1 of the cyclohexane. So the structure is like cyclohexane with substituents at 3 (benzyloxy methyl) and 5 (allyl group), and at position 1, a hydrazone group (R-C=N-NH-Ts).

When BuLi is added, perhaps it deprotonates the alpha position to the carbonyl (now hydrazone). The alpha protons are at position 2 of the cyc
