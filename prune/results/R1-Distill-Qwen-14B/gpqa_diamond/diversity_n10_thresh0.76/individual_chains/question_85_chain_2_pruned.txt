Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two planets orbiting a star. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The given data includes the star's mass, radius, and temperature. Then, each planet's mass, radius, and the Doppler shifts they cause in a forbidden line.

Wait, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, actually, I think it's more precise to say that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. But since the star is the same for both planets, maybe I can find a ratio based on their distances.

But wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so albedo cancels out when taking the ratio. So, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will depend on the square root of the inverse of their distances. Like, T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ), because T is proportional to sqrt(1/a).

But how do I find the distances a1 and a2? The question provides the Doppler shifts from both planets. Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit. The RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit, which can be used to find the planet's orbital period and distance if we know the mass and other factors.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity change of the star. The formula I remember is K = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (
