Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember from my studies that when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. So the key here is to apply those conservation laws.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? Since it's neutrino, I think it's a leptonic particle, and it's probably massless or has negligible mass compared to the others. So maybe I can approximate its mass as zero for this calculation.

The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary. That's important because it means the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero since momentum is conserved. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But wait, neutrinos are almost massless, so their momentum would be approximately equal to their energy since E ≈ pc for massless particles.

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass (m_mu) of 105.7 MeV, and the pion has a rest mass (m_pi) of 139.6 MeV. The neutrino's mass is negligible, so I can ignore it.

I think the approach here is to use energy and momentum conservation.

Let me write down what I know:

Initial state: Pion is at rest. So initial energy is just its rest energy: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energies are the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

Since energy is conserved, E_final = E_initial. So,

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Now, considering momentum. The total momentum must be zero. So,

p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = -p_nu.

But the neutrino's momentum is about E_nu / c, assuming it's massless. So p_nu ≈ E_nu / c.

So, p_mu = - E_nu / c
