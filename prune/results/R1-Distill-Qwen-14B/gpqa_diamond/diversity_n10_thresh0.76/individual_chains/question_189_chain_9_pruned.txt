Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are phonon, skyrmion, magnon, and pion.

Hmm, I remember that when a symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of these particles called Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that for each continuous symmetry that's broken, there's a massless boson. But wait, some of these particles might be massive due to other effects, like if the symmetry is approximate or if there's a mechanism that gives them mass.

Let's go through each option:

A) Phonon: Phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. I think they're quasiparticles arising from the quantized vibrations, like sound waves. But wait, do they come from a spontaneously broken symmetry? I'm not so sure. Phonons are more about the lattice vibrations, which are tied to the crystal's structure. Maybe they aren't exactly Goldstone bosons. Or perhaps in some contexts, like in solid-state systems where symmetry breaking leads to phonons as the residual symmetry's Goldstone modes.

B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were originally proposed by Skyrme to model certain particles. I think they arise in theories where there's a symmetry that's spontaneously broken, like in the pion model of the nucleus. Skyrmions aren't Goldstone bosons themselves because they have a topological charge, which gives them stability. So they might not be directly tied to a Goldstone mode.

C) Magnon: Magnons are related to spin waves in magnetic materials. I remember that when a magnetic material has a certain ordering, like ferromagnetic, the spin waves (magnons) are the Goldstone bosons for the broken rotational symmetry. So when the material orders magnetically, the continuous rotational symmetry is broken, and magnons (massless) appear as Goldstone bosons. But wait, in reality, magnons have spin-1 and might gain effective mass, but I think they are still considered as arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

D) Pion: Pions are well-known Goldstone bosons. In the Standard Model, the approximate chiral symmetry of the quark masses leads to pions as the Goldstone particles. But wait, the actual pions are massless in the limit of massless quarks, but in the real world, they get a small mass because the quarks have masses. So pions are definitely associated with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.

So the question is asking which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So which one isn't a Goldstone boson or doesn't emerge from such a breaking.

Phonons are quasiparticles in solids, but I think they arise from the breaking of translational symmetry when the crystal forms a lattice. Translational symmetry is broken, and that leads to phonons as the Goldstone modes. So phonon would be a Goldstone boson.

Wait, but wait. Translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry. In a solid, when you have a periodic crystal structure, the translational symmetry is broken to a discrete
