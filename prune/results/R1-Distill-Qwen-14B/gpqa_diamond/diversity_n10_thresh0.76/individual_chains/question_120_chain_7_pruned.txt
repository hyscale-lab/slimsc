Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see... The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we're supposed to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws of 1 over plx raised to some exponent.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther away, the parallax is smaller. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So I think this relates to how stars are distributed in terms of distance, which affects their density in the parallax space.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I guess that means their spatial density is constant. But when we look at them from Earth, their distribution in parallax won't be uniform because of the way distance works. Let me think about flux or how many stars we observe at different distances.

Wait, the number of stars in a given volume of space is proportional to the volume. But when considering distance, the volume of a shell at distance r with thickness dr is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr. Because the density (number per volume) is uniform, the number of stars in a shell increases with r squared.

But parallax is
