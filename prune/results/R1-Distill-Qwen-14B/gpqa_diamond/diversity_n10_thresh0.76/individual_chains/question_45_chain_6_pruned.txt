Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. They've given E as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so E is the base energy unit for n=1. That makes sense because E_1 would just be E.

But wait, the question is about four identical particles. Oh right, identical particles have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Spin-1/2 means each particle has a spin state of either up or down.

So for each n, there can be two particles: one with spin up and another with spin down. Because each n level can hold two fermions. So the first thing I need to do is figure out how the four particles fill the available energy levels.

Let me think: the ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. So we start filling the lowest n possible. For n=1, we can have two particles (spin up and down). Similarly, n=2 can hold two more particles. That accounts for four particles. So the ground state would have all four particles filled in the first two energy levels.

Wait, no. Wait, four particles total. So for n=1, two particles. Then for n=2, the next two. So ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible n's.

So each particle in the same n level has the same energy, but different spins. So the total energy of the system in the ground state would be the sum of the energies of each particle. Since n=1 has two particles, each with energy E. Then n=2 has two particles each with energy E_2. What's E_2 in terms of E? E_2 is (2²) E =4E. So each of the two particles in n=2 contributes 4E. So total energy is (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. Hmm, so the ground state is 10E?

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about four identical particles. Wait, spin-1/2, so each can have up or down spin. So each n level can hold two particles. So with four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with spin up and down). The next two go into n=2, same spins. So the total energy for the ground state would be (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because if all four particles are in the lowest
