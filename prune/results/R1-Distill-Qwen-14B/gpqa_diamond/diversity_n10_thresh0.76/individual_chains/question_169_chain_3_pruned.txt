Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the question says that two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and emit two E's and two V's. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V's, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is how the total energy spectrum of E changes compared to the original decay.

Wait, I remember that in decay processes, the energy spectra of emitted particles depend on whether the decay is allowed and what else is emitted. In beta decay, for example, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the neutrino emission. Oh right, in beta minus decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The electron's energy is continuous because the neutrino carries away some energy, so the electron can't have a maximum value. Wait, no, actually, the maximum energy (endpoint) would be when the neutrino is at rest, but that's impossible because it's massless. So the maximum energy is the total available energy minus the neutrino's energy, which is zero, so the maximum is the total available.

Wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me think again. In beta decay, the electron's energy can vary from zero up to a maximum value, Q. That's because the antineutrino can take away varying amounts of energy. So the electron's spectrum is continuous, starting from zero to Q.

In the original decay given, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So E must be similar to beta particles, where particles are emitted along with other particles that carry away energy. So in the original case, maybe E and V are like beta particles and neutrinos.

In the original reaction, two E's and two V's are emitted. So each E would have a continuous spectrum because V's could carry away energy. Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M, which is massless. So the number of particles emitted has changed.

Wait, the initial process is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So it's like two E's and two V's. Now, in the variant, it's 2E and 1 M.

Wait no, the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So two E's and one M. Because M is massless and exotic. So M is like a neutrino, perhaps, but only one is emitted.

So in the original case, each E's energy is determined by the distribution of the two V's. Since V's are emitted, their energies would vary, leading to a continuous spectrum for E. Now, with M being massless, but only one being emitted, how does that affect the E's spectrum?

Wait, I think the key here is conservation of energy and momentum. In the original decay, with two V's, the E's would have their energies determined by the possible energy and momentum that the V's can carry. Since V's are likely massless (like photons or neutrinos), their emission would allow the E's to have a continuous distribution.

In the variant, there's only one M, which is massless. So when the decay emits 2E and 1M, the M's energy would be determined by the system. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum (E=pc). So when you have two E's and one M, the conservation laws come into play.

Wait, the original decay: 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Let me think about the original scenario. If V's are massless, like photons, then the energy and momentum of each V can vary, which would mean that the E's share the remaining energy.
