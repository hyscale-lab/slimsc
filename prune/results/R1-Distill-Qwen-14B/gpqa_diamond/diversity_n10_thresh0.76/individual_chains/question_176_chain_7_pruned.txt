Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem states that we have a system in a certain state at time t, which is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—hold on, in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as column vectors, right? But the elements here are -1, 2, 1. Hmm. I'm going to assume that the state is a normalized vector. But wait, let me check the normalization. The state vector should satisfy ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. Let's compute the magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. So perhaps the actual state is this vector divided by sqrt(6), since the norm is sqrt(6). I'll keep that in mind.

Next, we have two observables, P and Q, represented by their respective matrices. The operator P's matrix has elements in the first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And Q's matrix is diagonal: [
[1,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,-1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That means when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P.

Wait, no, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. So the process is: measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state. So we need to find the probability that the first measurement (of P) gives 0, and the second (of Q) gives -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it
