Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers, but the question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism, so I need to think about those.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let's break down what each term means. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a electron pair between adjacent atoms, leading to the formation of different isomers. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or in cases where a hydrogen can move, like in enols and enol ethers. For example, in something like a carbonyl group, if there's a nearby hydrogen that can shift, you might get tautomerism. But wait, waitâ€”tautomerism is more about keto-enol tautomerism, right? So, something like benzaldehyde can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent hydrogen. Wait, no, wait another thought. If a compound has a conjugated system that allows for the shift, like two carbonyl groups adjacent, maybe it can't tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't present.

Looking at the compounds given for part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone specifically could be 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two keto groups opposite each other. Wait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three keto groups on a cyclohexane ring, each at 1,3,5 positions. So, each is separated by two carbons.

Now, for tautomerism, let's see. Benzoquinone: if it's 1,4-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on opposite ends. Are there any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Let's imagine the structure. Benzene ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to the ring.
