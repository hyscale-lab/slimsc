Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, the question gives me a moving point charge q with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). 

I remember that the potentials are scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field. The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations when there are charges and currents.

Wait, the charge is moving, so it's not just a static situation. I think I should use the retarded potentials here because the fields at a point r depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. Retarded because the fields can't travel faster than light, so the influence from the charge's past position affects the current fields.

So for scalar potential V, I recall the formula involves the charge divided by (4πε₀) times a term that includes the distance and possibly some time delay. But I'm not sure about the exact form. Oh right, the scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [ 1 / (r - (v/c) * (r - d)/d ) ]

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time when the field was generated, so t = tr + (r - d)/c, where d is the distance at time tr. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of the potential in terms of the charge's position and velocity at time tr.

Alternatively, the scalar potential can be written as V = q/(4πε₀) * [1 / (r - (v/c) (t - tr))] but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, no, more accurately, the potential at a point is due to the charge's position at an earlier time. So the scalar potential might be V = q/(4πε₀) * 1/(r'), where r' is the position of the charge at tr. But also, because the charge is moving, there might be some correction term involving velocity.

Wait no, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is
