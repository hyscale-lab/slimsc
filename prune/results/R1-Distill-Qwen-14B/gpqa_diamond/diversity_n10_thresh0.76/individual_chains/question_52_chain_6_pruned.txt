Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about stars with and without dark spots affecting certain ratios of atoms in their photosphere. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the star has some parameters. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. The radius is 1.5 solar radii, and mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. Wait, no, waitâ€”actually, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500K. Hmm, so the spots themselves are cooler, but how does that affect the overall Teff? Or wait, maybe the star's total surface area is reduced in emitting flux because 40% is cooler, so the average Teff would drop. But wait, that might not be entirely accurate because effective temperature is an average measure.

But the main question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. The ratio is n1/n2. And when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So the question is asking for (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_has_spots. Or wait, the factor by which it changes when without spots compared to when it has. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_has_spots. Because the ratio decreases when spots are present, this factor would be greater than 1.

In LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2>E1, and
