Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again and jot down the important points.

So, the setup is that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total mass is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air, and only a mixture of gases formed. These gases were passed through three tubes in order: one with Mg(ClO4)2, another with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the last with red-hot copper.

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60 grams.
- Tube 3 (Cu) gained 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) didn't change in weight.
- After that, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are numbers like 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to figure out what the original salts A and B are, and then calculate the total atoms.

Let me start by thinking about the gases. When the salts are heated, they decompose into gases. Then, these gases go through the tubes. 

First, tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant. It probably absorbs water, so maybe the gas that reacts here is water vapor. So, the first tube gains 3.60g, which would be the mass of the water absorbed. So, the mass of H2O is 3.60g. Let me calculate the moles of H2O. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles of H2O.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The copper gains mass, which is probably due to the formation of CuO. The mass gained is 0.80g. So, let's think about the reaction here. When a gas reacts with copper, it could be CO2 or something else. The reaction for CO2 would be CO2 + Cu → CuO + CO. But wait, the mass increase is from the reaction. Let me calculate the moles of whatever gas reacted here.

The mass of CuO formed is 0.80g? Or is it the mass gained by the tube? I think the latter. So, the 0.80g is the mass of the product minus the reactant. For example, if it's CO2 reacting with copper, the reaction would be 2CO2 + 2Cu → 2CuO + 2CO. So, for each mole of CO2 consumed, it produces one mole of CuO. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol. So, if the tube gained 0.80g, that's the mass of CuO formed. So, moles of CuO is 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 moles. So, that would also be 0.01 moles of CO2 reacting, because each CO2 gives one CuO.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky here. Let me think again. The mass gain in the copper tube is due to the reaction. If the gas is CO2, then:

CO2 + Cu → CuO + CO (but this reaction might need heat). So, for each mole of CO2 consumed, we get one mole of CuO. So, 0.80g CuO is 0.01 moles. So CO2 would be 0.01 moles.

Alternatively, if the gas is H2O, but I don't think H2O would react with copper under normal conditions. More likely, it's CO or another gas.

Wait,
