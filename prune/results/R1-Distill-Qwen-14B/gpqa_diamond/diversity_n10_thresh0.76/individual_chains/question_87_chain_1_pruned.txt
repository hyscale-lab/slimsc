Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. From the peaks in the FTIR, I know there's a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the structure. A six-membered aromatic ring means it's either benzene, or perhaps naphthalene, but wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene has six carbons, so the substituents must add up to two more. Since it's di-substituted, there are two substituents on the benzene ring. Let me think: each substituent would contribute the remaining carbons. Wait, the total is 8, so benzene (6) plus substituents (2) gives 8. So each substituent must be a methyl group? No, wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So we have a carbonyl group attached to the ring and a halogen attached as another substituent. That makes sense. So benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, or maybe an ester, but esters have more oxygen), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent. Let me think about possible structures. If it's a di-substituted benzene, let's imagine one substituent is -CO- something and the other is -X (X being halogen). Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or ketone substituent.

Wait, but the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Let's count: benzene is 6 carbons. So the two substituents contribute 2 more. So each substituent must have one carbon each. Because 6 + 2 = 8. So, each substituent is a single carbon. So substituent A is -CO-R and substituent B is -X, but wait, that might not add up.
