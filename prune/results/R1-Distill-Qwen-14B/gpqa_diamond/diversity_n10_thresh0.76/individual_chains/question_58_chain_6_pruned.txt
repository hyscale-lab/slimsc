Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization when the energy gets high. Let's think through each option.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are those pesky infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make these calculations finite so you can handle them properly. But some theories might not need this because they're already free from such issues or perhaps have a different structure.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me go through each one.

Starting with option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? In classical physics, electromagnetism is described by Maxwell's equations. Do they require regularization? Well, classical theories don't usually deal with quantum divergences because they're not quantized. So in classical electrodynamics, you won't have the same kinds of infinities as in quantum theories. Like, when you calculate things classically, you might have issues with point charges or self-interactions, but I don't think regularization is a concept used there. So maybe D is the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory, so it definitely has divergences. These require regularization. For example, when calculating loop diagrams like the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. So renormalization techniques, which include regularization, are essential for QED. So C doesn't fit the question because it does require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory with similar issues as QED. At high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, but it still has divergences that need to be handled. So regularization is definitely used here. So B isn't the right answer either.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theories aim to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. They deal with higher-dimensional spaces and are background-dependent, but I'm not sure about regularization here. Wait, string theories are thought to be finite, meaning they don't require the same kind of renormalization as QFTs. Because strings have higher spin states and perhaps the interactions are different, leading to no or less divergences. If that's the case, then superstring theory might not need regularization. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think that in some formulations, like perturbative string theory, certain divergences appear but are handled differently, perhaps via the string sigma model approach rather than traditional regularization methods. Or maybe they don't require it because the theory is already finite. Alternatively, some sources say that string theories are finite, so they don't need renormalization, which implies no regularization is needed. So A could be a candidate.

Wait, the question is about which theory "never requires regularization". So if QED and QCD require regularization, and D is classical ED which doesn't, then D is a possible answer. But what about superstring theory? Because I thought that in string theory, you don't have point particles, so maybe the divergences that occur in QFT don't appear. So for A, maybe it doesn't require regularization either. So which between A and D is correct.

Wait, the question asks which theory "never" requires regularization. So I have two candidates: D and A.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Let me think about each theory's behavior at high energies.

In superstring theory, at high energies, the theory is supposed to work without issues, being a theory of quantum gravity. But I'm not sure if regularization is needed there.

Wait, in quantum field theories, regularization is a tool to handle divergences which appear when you go to high energies (like in loop integrals). String theory is different because it doesn't have point particles, hence perhaps no such divergences.

But wait,
