Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate reagent. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically open epoxides in a specific way.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, let me draw that structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means there are two rings, right? A seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. The substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in place of a carbon, so it's an epoxide.

So the structure is a norbornene-like structure with an epoxide. The configuration is 1R,3R,4R,6S. Hmm, that's a bit complex. When it reacts with Me2CuLi, which is an organocuprate, the reaction should proceed via nucleophilic attack on the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Wait, but I also remember that in disubstituted epoxides, the nucleophile adds with inversion of configuration at the carbon where it attacks.

Let me think about the mechanism. Organocuprates typically open epoxides in an SN2-like manner. The less substituted carbon is more accessible, so the nucleophile (which is the methyl group from Me2CuLi) will attack the less hindered carbon. But wait, in some cases, like with more substituted epoxides, the attack might be on the more substituted if it's more stable, but here the question says it's always at the less hindered. So perhaps in this case, the cyclopropane ring's structure directs where the attack happens.

The starting material is a bicyclic epoxide. I'm trying to imagine the structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two bridgeheads. Let me number the atoms. Starting from the first bridgehead, then the bridge is going to the next bridgehead. The 7 is the oxygen, so that's in the ring. So the epoxide is between two adjacent carb
