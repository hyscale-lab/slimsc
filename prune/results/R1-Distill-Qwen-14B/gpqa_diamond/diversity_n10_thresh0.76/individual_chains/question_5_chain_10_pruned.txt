Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that operators in quantum mechanics often have eigenvectors corresponding to their eigenstates, like spin states.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, these look familiar. They must be components of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled.
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix. Wait, the Pauli Y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], right. So yeah, same as Py.
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0],[0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Now, the operator we're interested in is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, which means it can be written as n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ) or something like that. Wait, no, actually wait. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle would typically be measured differently. Oh, right, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to the azimuthal angle φ=0 or π, but for direction in x-z, the angle θ would be the polar angle from the z-axis. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but in two dimensions, perhaps we're considering it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) but projected into x and z. Hmm, but wait, the operator is in two dimensions, so maybe the spin is in 2D space, like spin-1/2 particles. So the direction n is a 2D vector in the x-z plane, meaning it's along the x and z axes.

Wait, the operator P is given for components x, y, z. So the operator along n is P·n, right? So P·n would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is lying in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator along n is P·n = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z). Because the y-component is zero.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, n can be any direction in that plane. Hmm, but to find the eigenvector, maybe I can choose a specific direction,
