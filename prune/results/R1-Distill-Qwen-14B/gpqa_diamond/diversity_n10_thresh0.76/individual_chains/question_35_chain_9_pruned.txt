Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go slowly.

First, the problem states that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon, is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write down S first.

S matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), I need to plug that in. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π). 

So, Ay matrix:
[ (0)*(h/(4π)) , (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ (i)*(h/(4π)), (0)*(h/(4π)) ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0 , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Hmm, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix (Ay - a I) is:
[ -a , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)*(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))² ]

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Let me calculate that. (-i)*i = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So, that term becomes [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ].

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate. The determinant is (Ay - a I) determinant. So:

Ay - a I is:

[ -a          -i (h/(4π)) ]
[ i (h/(4π))   -a         ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))² ].

As before, (-i)(i) is 1, so the determinant is a² - [ (1) (h²/(16 π²)) ] = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, that's the eigenvalues. So possible eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). 

Looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh. Wait, that doesn't make sense because h/(4π) is a real number. So the eigenvalues are real, with imaginary parts zero. So option A is incorrect because it's talking about the imaginary parts being non-zero.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, this can't be right because our eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. I'm not sure about that. Let me think. The operator A is
