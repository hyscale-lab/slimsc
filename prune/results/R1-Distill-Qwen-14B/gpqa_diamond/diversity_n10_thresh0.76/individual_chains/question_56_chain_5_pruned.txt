Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum.

Wait, dipole transitions are governed by selection rules. I think for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen (non-relativistic), the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, that's right. So l can change by one unit, and m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final is n=1, l=0, m=0. Wait, but how does that happen in two steps? Because n=3 to n=1 is a drop of two energy levels. So it can't happen in a single dipole transition because Δn would have to be ±1, right? So it must go through an intermediate state.

So the first transition would be from 3,0,0 to some state with l=1, because l must change by ±1. Since initial l is 0, the next l must be 1. So the possible transitions would be to states with l=1.

What's the possible n in the intermediate state? Since n can change by ±1 in each step, starting from n=3, the first transition could be to n=2 or n=4. But since the final state is n=1, which is lower than 3, it's more likely that the first transition goes to n=2. Because going to n=4 would require a higher energy transition, but maybe it's possible. Wait, but the final state is n=1, so the second step would have to go from n=2 to n=1. Let's think: n starts at 3, first step can be to 2 or 4. But considering the final state is 1, which is lower than 3, the first step is more likely to go down. So first step is 3→2, second step
