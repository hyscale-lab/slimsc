Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. The products are then combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. We need to determine how many peaks are observed in each case.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I:
The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group in hexan-3-one will be reduced. Let me draw the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure: It's a six-carbon chain. The ketone is at C3, and there's a methoxy group at C5. The configuration is S, so the substituents around C5 are arranged in a specific way.

After LAH reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So the product will be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can also potentially reduce other groups. But in this case, the only functional group is the ketone, so that's the main reaction.

So Reaction I gives 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The configuration at C5 is still S because the reduction of the ketone doesn't touch that center. The OH is now at C3, and the molecule's configuration at C5 remains as S.

Reaction II:
Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4, followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone. Structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but wait, actually pentane-2,4-dione would be (CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are the ketone groups. So structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no, that's 4-pentanone if it's O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-, but no, wait.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-, but wait, that's four carbons. Oh, no, pentane has five. So maybe it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because the chain would be longer. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)COCH2COCH3. No, that would be 3-pentanone. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Pentane-2,4-dione has ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So the structure is: 

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-? Wait, but that's five carbons? Let's count: 1 (CH3), 2 (C=O), 3 (CH2), 4 (C=O), 5 (CH2). Hmm, but that would be pentane-2,4-dione, yes.

So when NaBH4 is used on a diketone, it typically reduces both ketones. But wait, NaBH4 is a milder reagent compared to LAH. It can reduce ketones, but in some cases, especially if there are other groups, it might not. But in this case, it's a diketone, so both ketones would be reduced.

Wait, but wait: NaBH4 is not as strong as LAH, but it can reduce ketones. So pentane-2,4-dione would be reduced to pentane-2,4-diol. Because each ketone (C=O) will become a CH-OH group.

So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? Or wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. No, that would only be four carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: pentane has five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are ketones.
