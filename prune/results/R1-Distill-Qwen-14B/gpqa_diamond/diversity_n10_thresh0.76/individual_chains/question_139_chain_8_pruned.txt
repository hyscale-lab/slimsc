Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it through again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After this treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, wait. Diketones are compounds with two ketone groups. So the reaction must be converting the starting materials into these diketones. I remember that certain reagents can lead to the formation of ketones. Oh right, the HCl, NaNO2, and H2O setup... I think this is related to the Stephen reduction or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: I recall that when alcohols are treated with nitrous acid (like HCl, NaNO2), it can lead to the formation of ketones. Oh wait, that's the Stephen reduction! Or wait, maybe it's the oxidation of alcohols? No, wait, Stephen reduction is the conversion of ketones to alcohols, but that's not right. Wait, no, the Stephen reduction is when a ketone is treated with a nitrite, HCl, and water to form an alcohol. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, if an alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O, it might lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh right! I think that's the case when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid and H2O, leading to an oxidation into a ketone. So the reaction is: secondary alcohol â†’ ketone via oxidation. But wait, primary alcohols can't form ketones because they'd end up as carboxylic acids or maybe ketones if it's a different mechanism. Wait, no, primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes (under certain conditions) or further to carboxylic acids. Secondary alcohols oxidize to ketones. So I think that in this case, the treatment converts the starting materials into diketones, which implies that the starting materials must have two secondary alcohol groups. Or maybe one primary and one secondary? No, probably two secondary alcohols because each would become a ketone.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNO2 and HCl
