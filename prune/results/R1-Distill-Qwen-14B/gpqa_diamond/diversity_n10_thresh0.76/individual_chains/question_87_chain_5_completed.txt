Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. The compound has a six-membered ring and a total of 8 carbons. Oh wait, aromatic rings are usually six-membered, so that makes sense. Also, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to figure out which NMR option matches this structure.

Let me break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, so benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. So benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. But wait, substituents can be groups like -X (like Cl, Br, etc.), which don't add carbons. Or maybe they do. Wait, the substituents could be things like -OCH3, which would add one carbon (the methyl group), but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen (like Cl). Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen. Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the substituent, right?

Wait, let me think. The substituent could be a carbonyl group, like an acyl group. Wait, but for a six-membered ring with two substituents, each substituent adds some carbons. So the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So maybe each substituent is one carbon each? Wait, that would add two carbons. But how?

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone) which is a single carbon (like a carbonyl attached to the ring, which would be a ketone group, but that would be a substituent like R-CO- attached, which I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an ester or something else.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options give different NMR spectra. Let's look at each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, in aromatic compounds, a substituent like -CHO would be present. But wait, the presence of a carbonyl in the IR suggests maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But if it's a di-substituted benzene with an aldehyde group and a halogen, perhaps?

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the substituent could be a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's think about the substituents. So one substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone group (CO-) and another is a halogen (X). Let's model that.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone substituent, such as a COCH3 group?), but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, but how does that fit into the structure?

Wait, let me think again. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents must add 2 carbons. If one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, which is -X, no carbon), then the other substituent must have two carbons. Wait, because 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So one substituent is an X (no carbons), the other is a group with two carbons. What group with two carbons has a carbonyl?

Ah! Maybe an acetyl group (COCH3). So the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the benzene ring has a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. So the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3.

Now, looking at the NMR for such a structure. For the aromatic protons, the substituents will influence their shifts. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. The COCH3 group would have a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. Wait, but in the para position, the aromatic protons would be as two pairs: ortho and meta to substituents.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two strong electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and COCH3, the aromatic protons would be deshielded. Let me think. The substituent Cl is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), as is the COCH3 group. In para-substitution, each substituent affects the neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are meta to each other, but the di-substituted would imply two substituents on the ring, which could be ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, but in the case of two EWGs in para positions, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, you get two doublets for the aromatic protons. So in the NMR spectrum, there would be two doublets around 7.5-8.5 ppm.

Looking at option A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). That fits a para-substituted benzene with two EWG substituents. The two doublets correspond to the two sets of aromatic protons. The singlet at 9.9 ppm might be an aldehyde proton. But wait, if one substituent is a carbonyl, like COCH3, then the aldehyde wouldn't be present. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, but that wouldn't have an H to show up as a singlet.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The carbonyl in the IR can be from a ketone or an aldehyde. If it's a ketone, then maybe the substituent is a COCH3 group (acetophenone-like). If it's an aldehyde, then the substituent would be a -CHO group.

But wait, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Let's model this as benzene with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, as in option A. The COCH3 group would have a singlet at around 2.5-3 ppm for the methyl group. But in option A, there's a singlet at 3.7 ppm for 2H. Wait, that's not a methyl group, that's two protons. Oh wait, maybe it's an OCH2 group? Because OCH3 would be around 3.3 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, it's 3.7 ppm, 2H as a singlet. Hmm, that doesn't immediately make sense. Unless it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group (OAc), but that might not fit the carbonyl in the IR.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another possibility. Maybe the substituent with the carbonyl is an acetyl group (COCH3) and the other substituent is a substituent that's not a halogen but something else. Wait, no, the IR shows aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents are a halogen and a carbonyl group. So for example, benzene with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as in option A.

But in that case, the COCH3 group's methyl protons would be a singlet around 2.5 ppm. But option A has a singlet at 3.7 ppm. That's higher than typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Maybe if it's an OCH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't a COCH3. Maybe it's a ketone group, but how else can we have a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, like OAc (which would have a carbonyl). But then the substituent would be OAc and Cl.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. If the substituent is OAc, which is O-COCH3, then the methyl from the ester would be a singlet around 2.1 ppm. But if that's the case, perhaps the NMR would have a singlet around that region. Looking at the options, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which could be the OAc methyl group.

But wait, the substituent would be OAc and Cl. Let's model that. Benzene with OAc and Cl in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets, as in option C. The OAc group would have a COOCH3, but wait, no, OAc is O-COCH3, so the O is attached to the benzene, then the COCH3.

Wait, but OAc is an electron-withdrawing group. So the aromatic protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So in the NMR, they would be around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm as doublets, as in option C.

Option C's NMR shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. That would fit the OAc methyl group.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group. OAc has two carbonyl groups: the ester. So that would fit. And the aromatic-halogen bond would be from the Cl substituent.

So the structure would be 4-chloro acetophenone? Or 4-chloro phenyl acetate? Wait, no. If the substituent is OAc, then it's more like 4-chlorobenzyl acetate? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring. So if one substituent is Cl and the other is OAc, then it's para-chloro acetophenone? No, acetophenone is a ketone. Wait, OAc is an ester group, right? So if the substituent is OAc, then the structure would be para-chlorophenoxy acetyl something? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COCl group, but that's a different scenario. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group, but that's not relevant here as the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each option and the possible structures.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Peaks at 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 ppm is a strong downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. So if the substituent is -CHO, then the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. So the structure would have a para-substituted benzaldehyde with another substituent, like Cl. So benzene with Cl and CHO in para positions. But wait, the total carbons are 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) =7. But the question says 8 carbons. So that doesn't fit. So that can't be. So option A would have 7 carbons, but the compound has 8. So option A is out.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like two sets of doublets around 4.8 and 4.6, which could be from a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. The 3H singlet suggests a methyl group attached to something. Maybe this is a di-substituted ethylene, like a -OCH2CH2O- structure or something else. Not sure how this ties into the aromatic ring. Probably not the right option.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like OAc or COCH3. The aromatic protons are two doublets, which suggests para substitution with two EWGs. So perhaps the substituents are Cl and OAc in para positions. Wait, but OAc is O-CO-CH3. So the benzene has Cl and OCOCH3 as substituents. So the carbons in the substituents: Cl has none, OCOCH3 has three carbons (the methyl), so 6 (benzene) + 3 (OCOCH3) + 0 (Cl) =9. But the compound has 8 carbons. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe OAc isn't the substituent.

Alternatively, if the substituent is COCH3, then that's two carbons (the CO is one, the CH3 is another), plus Cl (no carbons). So 6 + 2 =8 carbons. That's correct.

So the structure would be para-chloroacetophenone. The substituents are Cl and COCH3 (which is two carbons). So the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets. The COCH3 would have a singlet for the methyl group. But where? Typically, a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (like in acetophenone) appears around 2.6 ppm. So in option C, the singlet is at 2.3, which is close. But let me think again. Wait, the NMR in option C has a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H. So that's likely a COCH3 group.

So the aromatic protons would be two doublets at around 7.8 and 7.6. That's what option C shows, so that could be correct. But wait, let's check the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 is an aromatic proton. The others are probably from a CH2 group attached to something. For example, maybe a -OCH2CH2O- group or an ester. But I'm not sure. Also, the substituents on the benzene would influence this, but I don't see a clear match here.

So, based on the carbons, option C has 6 (benzene) + 3 (OAc) =9, which doesn't fit. Wait, no: if the substituent is COCH3 (two carbons in the substituent), that's 6 + 2 =8. So OAc has three carbons, which would make the total 9, which doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the substituent is COCH2Cl? No, that would be more carbons.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.

If the substituents are Cl (0 carbons) and COCH3 (2 carbons), then total carbons would be 6 + 0 + 2 =8. That's correct. So substituent groups are Cl and COCH3.

Now, the NMR for the COCH3 group would be a singlet at around 2.6 ppm for 3H. Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is a bit lower, but possible. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as in option C.

But wait, the carbonyl in IR would be from the COCH3 group. So that's a ketone. So the structure is para-chloroacetophenone.

Wait, acetophenone is a benzene ring with a COCH3 substituent. So para substitution would have the Cl in the para position. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is what option C has.

So the 1H NMR should have:

- Two doublets for the aromatic protons.
- A singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Option C has these. The aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, which are downfield, which makes sense with the electron-withdrawing substituents (Cl and COCH3). The singlet at 2.3 ppm is a bit upfield compared to typical acetophenone (around 2.6), but maybe due to the Cl's electron-withdrawing effect which could deshield the methyl group more, causing it to appear downfield. Or perhaps there's another effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group. Let me think: If the substituent is OCOCH3 (acetate group), that would have a carbonyl (from the ester) and a methyl group. But in that case, the substituent adds three carbons (O-CO-OCH3?), but wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which would make the substituent have two carbons beyond the oxygen. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the OCOCH3 group would have a carbonyl, yes. So for the substituent OCOCH3, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-OCH3. But that's a phenyl ester. Wait, but that would have more carbons than allowed. Let's count: benzene (6) + OCOCH3 (3 carbons: O-CO-OCH3 has two carbons (the CO and the OCH3 has one carbon), so 6+3=9, which is more than the 8 required. So that can't be.

So back to the initial thought: COCH3 and Cl as substituents. So the structure is para-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (since substituents are para).
- The COCH3 as a singlet around 2.5-3 ppm.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d) for aromatic protons, and 2.3 (3H, s) for COCH3.

But wait, I thought the methyl group in acetophenone is around 2.6 ppm. So 2.3 is a bit low. But maybe the Cl is pulling the electron density, causing the methyl to deshield more and appear slightly downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't in the para position. If the substituents are meta, the aromatic protons would split differently, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent is Cl attached to the aromatic ring, not as a leaving group or something else.

So I think option C is the correct one. Let me check the other options again.

Option A: singlet at 9.9 which is an aldehyde. But the compound has 8 carbons, so if substituent is CHO (1 C) and Cl (0), total is 7. So option A can't be.

Option B: has triplet-like structures, perhaps an ethylene group. Doesn't fit with the aromatic substituent.

Option D: has a singlet at 6.9 which is an aromatic proton. That's unusual unless it's a para-substituted with two strong substituents, but with only one substituent. Not sure.

So I think option C is the correct one.


The problem involves identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. The compound is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a halogen (likely chlorine, Cl), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Compound**:  
   - Benzene has 6 carbons.  
   - Substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons.  
   - A halogen (Cl) contributes no carbons.  
   - The carbonyl-containing group contributes 2 carbons.  
   - A plausible substituent is a **COCH3 group** (acetophenone-like structure).  

   Thus, the compound is **para-chloroacetophenone**, where the benzene ring has a Cl and a COCH3 group in the para positions.

2. **FTIR and NMR Correlation**:  
   - The FTIR indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond.  
   - The 1H NMR spectrum should reflect the aromatic protons split into two doublets (due to the para-substitution) and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton (-CHO). However, an aldehyde substituent would only contribute 1 carbon, resulting in a total of 7 carbons (6 from benzene + 1 from aldehyde), which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. **Eliminated**.  
   - **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest protons on a CH2 group, likely near an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen). This does not align with the expected aromatic and carbonyl-containing substituents. **Eliminated**.  
   - **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to aromatic protons split into two doublets, consistent with para-substitution. A singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) matches the methyl group of the COCH3 substituent. This matches the expected structure of para-chloroacetophenone. **Correct**.  
   - **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton, but the other peaks (e.g., 4.8 ppm, 4.6 ppm) do not align with the expected substituents. **Eliminated**.

### Conclusion:
The correct 1H NMR spectrum corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of para-chloroacetophenone.
