Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The astronomers are looking at their luminosities. The given data is:

- Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.
- The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. M1 = 1.5 M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength from blackbody radiation. So they have the same effective temperature?
- Radial velocities: Star_1 is 0 km/s, Star_2 is 700 km/s. Wait, but how does radial velocity affect anything here? Maybe it's a redshift thing? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, that affects the observed wavelength. Oh wait, but in the problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same as observed. So maybe the radial velocity causes a shift in the peak wavelength, but they are the same. So that gives us a clue about their temperatures?

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. But the question is, what's that factor?

So the stars are radiating as black bodies. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

First, I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² is (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

So R squared ratio is 2.25.

Now, the temperatures: If both stars have the same peak wavelength, then they have the same temperature. Because for a blackbody, the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature (λ_max * T ≈ constant, Wien's law). So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 must equal T2. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. There's the radial velocity part. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So its light is Doppler shifted. So, the observed wavelength would be different from the actual emitted wavelength. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max for both is the same. So, the actual λ_max (emitted) of each must be adjusted for their velocities.

Hmm, I think I need to use the Doppler effect here. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but I might have the sign wrong. Wait, v_r is the radial velocity, which is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. So for Star_2, v_r is +700 km/s, moving
