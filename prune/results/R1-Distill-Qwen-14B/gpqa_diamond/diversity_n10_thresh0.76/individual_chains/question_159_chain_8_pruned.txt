Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to think it through. So the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines like Lyman-alpha are prominent, but wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the UV, right? Oh, but if the quasar is at a certain redshift, that line would be shifted into the optical or infrared.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. That's in the near-infrared. So if the peak is from a specific emission line, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line. The Lyman-alpha emission line is typically at about 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. But if the quasar is so far away that the universe's expansion has stretched the wavelength, it's redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift.

So the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the emitted is about 121.6 nm. The redshift z is (observed - emitted)/emitted. So (790 - 121.6)/121.6 = (668.4)/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z is around 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, quasars can have multiple emission lines. Another thought: maybe the peak is the Balmer break? The Balmer break is where the H-alpha line (656 nm) is redshifted into the optical. Oh wait, so if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's longer than 656, so z would be (790 - 656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z is ~0.2. That's much lower. Which scenario is more likely?

Hmm, but wait the problem says the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. So in the optical and near-infrared, the peak is at 790, and below that (shorter wavelengths) the flux is much lower. That makes me think of a spectral break due to the Lyman limit or the Lyman break. The Lyman break occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes opaque to light below a certain wavelength, which depends on redshift. So for high redshift objects, their UV emission is absorbed by the IGM, causing a drop in flux below a certain wavelength.

So if the peak is at 790 nm and flux drops below that, maybe the Lyman limit is at 790 nm, meaning the emitted Lyman limit is 912 Angstroms (91.2 nm), so the observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 nm - 91.2 nm)/91.2 nm. Let's compute that. 790 nm is 7900 Angstroms. 7900 - 912 = 6988 Angstroms. So z = 6988 / 912 ≈ 7.66. So z is about 7.66.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the numbers right. Let me convert everything to the same units. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is 7900 Angstroms. The emitted wavelength of the Lyman limit is 91.2 Angstroms (since 91.2 nm is 0.912 micrometers, but wait no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 91.2 nm is 912 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait: 1 nm = 10 Angstroms. So 91.2 nm is 912 Angstroms.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 91.2 nm is 912 Angstroms. Correct. So observed wavelength is 7900 Angstroms (790 nm). So the redshift z is (7900 - 912)/912 = (6988)/912 ≈ 7.66. So z ≈7.66.

That's a high redshift. So the quasar is at z ~7.66.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H(a)) da, where a is the scale factor (a=1 now, a=1/(1+z) at emission). But calculating that integral exactly would require knowing the Hubble parameter as a function of a, which depends on the cosmological parameters.
