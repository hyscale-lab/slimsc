Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Alright, the researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they used TLC and saw that the reactant spot was smaller, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to figure out which products are formed.

Hmm, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to draw that structure. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached. The other part is a butenyl group: specifically, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is a four-carbon chain where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (but-3-enyl), and there are two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, but wait, I think I got that wrong. But-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 in a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Oh wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but but only has four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH? No, wait, that canâ€™t be right. Let me correct this.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is the substituent where the substituent starts at the first carbon (because it's '-en
