Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

So, the problem says that an alien astronaut is traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast! And the astronaut is 22 years old, but we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Wait, but the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," so that's the proper time, right?

Wait, I remember that in special relativity, when you're moving at a high speed relative to another frame, time dilation occurs. So, the time experienced by the astronaut (their own time) would be shorter than the time measured in the Earth's frame. Or wait, no, wait. No, wait. Because from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at a high speed, so the distance is contracted. So the time they experience would be less than what someone on Earth would measure.

Wait, but wait. Let's get the facts straight. The distance between the LMC and Earth is something I should probably know. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth, approximately. But wait, the question doesn't give the distance, so maybe I'm supposed to assume that the distance is D, but wait, the problem doesn’t specify. Oh wait, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. So maybe the distance is given implicitly as the distance to Earth from the LMC. Or perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the time based on the Earth's frame and then apply time dilation.

Wait, but the astronaut's lifetime is 150 solar years. He's 22 now, so he's got about 128 years left. So if the trip takes longer than that, he won't survive. If it's shorter, he will.

Wait, but the problem is asking from the astronaut's perspective. So let's think about the proper time. Proper time is the time experienced by the traveler. So the formula for time dilation is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where tau is the proper time (astronaut's time) and t is the time in Earth's frame.

But wait, alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the Earth frame. Let me see. The distance between the two points is D (say, 163,000 light-years). The spacecraft is moving at speed v = 0.99999987c. So the time from Earth's perspective is t = D / v. But wait, that would be in Earth's frame.

But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. So the distance they see is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time experienced by the astronaut would be D' / v = (D * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))) / v.

Alternatively, I can use the time dilation formula: tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the setup right.

The Earth is at rest, the spaceship is moving at v towards Earth. So the Earth observer will calculate t = D / v. Then, the astronaut's proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's calculate that.

But wait, I don't know the distance D. Oh wait, perhaps the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away. So D = 163,000 ly.

Wait, let me compute t (Earth frame):

t = D / v.

v is 0.99999987c. So t = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) → but since 1 ly / c is 1 year, the time is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 163,000 years? Because 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so t is roughly 163,000 / (0.99999987) ≈ approx 163,000 * (1/(1 - 0.00000013)) ≈ approximately 163,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 21.2 ≈ 163,021 years. But maybe we can approximate v as 1, but no, it's 0.99999987, which is very close to 1, but not exactly.

Wait, but maybe I should compute more accurately. Let me think: 0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 0.00000013. So 1/ (1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + ... , but for small x, it's approximately 1 +x. So 1/(0.99999987) ≈ 1 + (1 - 0.99999987) = 1 + 0.00000013 ≈ 1.00000013.

So t = 163000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + 163000 * 1.3e-7.

163000 * 1e-7 is 0.0163. So 0.0163 * 1.3 is about 0.02119. So t ≈ 163021.021 years.

But wait, that's a really long time. So from Earth's frame, it takes about 163,021 years. But the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years, so 22 + 150 = 172 years max? Wait, no. The astronaut is 22 years old, so he has about 150-22 = 128 years left. So if the trip takes 163,021 years as per Earth, then from the astronaut's perspective, the trip would take less time due to time dilation. Let me compute that.

Tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → let's compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² → v²/c² = 0.99999974 → 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) → let's compute that. sqrt(2.6e-7) is about... Hmm, sqrt(2.5e-7) is approximately 5e-4 (since (5e-4)^2 = 25e-8 = 2.5e-7). So sqrt(2.6e-7) is about 5.099e-4, approximately 0.0005099.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099. Then, tau = t * 0.0005099.

From Earth's frame, t is about 163,021 years, so tau ≈ 163021 * 0.0005099 ≈ let's compute that.

163021 * 0.0005 is 81.5105 years. 163021 * 0.0000099 ≈ approximately 163021 *0.00001 is about 1.63, so 0.0000099 is 0.99 * 1.63 ≈ 1.6137.

So total tau ≈ 81.5105 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.124 years.

Wait, so tau is approximately 83 years. So the astronaut would experience about 83 years of travel time.

But wait, wait. The astronaut is 22 years old. 22 + 83 = 105 years old. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so he would survive. So the answer would be that it takes about 83 years from his perspective. But the options don't have 83. Let me look at the options again.

Options: A) die before reaching. B)72, C)81, D)77.

Hmm, my calculation gave about 83 years, but the options have 81 as option C. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's recalculate.

Compute v = 0.99999987c → v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4 → 0.0005099.

t (Earth frame) = D / v → D is 163,000 ly. So t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 → let me compute this more precisely.

0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + ... for small x. So 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 + ... ≈ 1.00000013000000169.

So t ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013000000169 ≈ 163000 + 163000 * 1.3e-7.

Compute 163000 * 1.3e-7 → 163000 * 1.3e-7 = (163000 * 1.3) * 1e-7. 163000 *1.3 = 211,900. 211900 * 1e-7 = 0.02119.

So t ≈ 163000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163000.02119 years.

Now, tau = t * 0.0005099 → 163000.02119 * 0.0005099.

Let me compute 163000 * 0.0005099 = 163000 * 5.099e-4.

163000 * 5e-4 = 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5. 163000 * 0.0000099 = let's compute that. 163000 * 0.0000099 = 163000 *9.9e-6 = 163000 * 9.9 / 1e6.

163000 *9.9 = 1,613,700 → divided by 1e6 → 1.6137.

So 81.5 + 1.6137 = 83.1137. Then plus 0.02119 *0.0005099. 0.02119 *0.0005 is about 0.000010595 → negligible. So tau ≈ approximately 83.114 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. The options are 72, 81, 77. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait, perhaps the distance isn't 163,000 light-years. Or maybe I should think differently.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the time from the astronaut's frame.

From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. So distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → D' = D * 0.0005099.

So D' = 163,000 * 0.0005099 = approx 82.897 light-years.

Then, the time experienced by the astronaut is D' / v → (82.897 ly) / (0.99999987c) → 82.897 /0.99999987 ≈ 82.897 * (1.00000013) ≈ 82.897 + 82.897 * 1.3e-7 ≈ 82.897 + 0.0107766 ≈ ~82.908 years.

Wait, that's about 83 years again. But the options don't have 83. So why is this happening?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong distance. Maybe the distance is 100,000 light-years or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the time from the astronaut's perspective, but using the Earth's frame's time.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate using the spaceship's frame. Wait, no, the question asks about the astronaut's perspective, which is the spaceship's frame.

Hmm, but with the numbers I'm getting, the time is around 83 years. The options don't have that, but option C is 81. Maybe the approximation is to think that sqrt(0.00000026) is about 0.0005099, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6)= about 1.612. sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.0003162. So 1.612 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.0005099. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 150 light-years? No, the LMC is much farther. Or perhaps I'm supposed to compute the time from Earth's frame and then see if it's longer than the astronaut's lifetime.

Wait, the astronaut is 22, and his lifetime is 150 years, so he has 128 years left. If the trip takes longer than 128 years from Earth's frame, then from his frame, due to time dilation, it's even shorter. Wait, no, wait: from Earth's frame, it's longer, but the astronaut's own time is shorter.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the Earth frame time. Let me recalculate t.

t = D / v → D is 163,000 ly.

v = 0.99999987c → So t = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ) → 163000 + (163000 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 163000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163000.021 years.

So from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 163,000 years. Which is way longer than the astronaut's lifetime. So, but from the astronaut's frame, the trip takes about 83 years, so he would survive.

Wait, but wait: the astronaut's perspective time is 83 years. He is 22, so 22 +83= 105 < 150. So he would live. So the answer would be it takes about 83 years, so the astronaut survives. But the options don't have 83. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem as the time experienced by the astronaut. So the options are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77.

So if the time is about 83 years, then none of the options except perhaps B, but 83 is closest to 81, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the distance is less. Let me think. Maybe the LMC is about 160,000 ly away, but perhaps the problem is using the distance as 1.6e5 ly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the time from the astronaut's perspective without considering the Earth's frame.

Wait, another approach: considering length contraction. The distance the astronaut travels is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the Earth's frame distance. Then, time is L / v.

So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.0005099.

So time tau = L0 * sqrt( ... ) / v → L0 / v * sqrt(...). Wait, but L0 / v is just t, the Earth frame time. So tau = t * sqrt(...), which brings me back to the same formula.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) more accurately.

Let me compute v = 0.99999987 → v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = ?

Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 → 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 → approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5 → sqrt(2.6)=1.61245, 1e-3.5 is about 3.162e-4. So 1.61245 * 3.162e-4 → approx 5.099e-4, as before.

So tau is approximately 83 years. Since none of the options match, but option C is 81, perhaps the intended answer is C, as the calculation is approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 150,000 light-years? Let me recalculate with D = 150,000 ly.

t (Earth frame) = 150000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 150000 * 1.00000013 → 150000 + 150000 * 1.3e-7 → 150000 + 0.0195 → 150000.0195 years.

Tau = t * 0.0005099 → 150000.0195 * 0.0005099.

Compute 150000 * 0.0005099 = 76.485 years.

Then, 0.0195 * 0.0005099 ≈ 0.00000992.

So tau ≈ 76.485 + 0.00000992 → approx 76.485 years. That's close to option D)77.

Hmm, so if the distance is 150,000 ly, then tau is about 76.5 years, which is about 77, option D.

But wait, I thought the LMC is 163,000 ly away. Maybe the problem is using a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to approximate v as 0.999999c, which would have a similar effect.

Let me compute v=0.999999c. So v^2 = 0.999998000001, so 1 - v²/c² = 0.000001999999.

sqrt(1.999999e-6) → sqrt(2e-6) is approx 0.00141421 → so sqrt(1.999999e-6) is about 0.0014142.

So tau = t * 0.0014142.

t = D / v → D=163,000 ly, v=0.999999c → t≈163,000 / (0.999999) → approx 163,000 * 1.000001 → 163,000 + 0.163 → 163,000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 * 0.0014142 → approx 163000 * 0.0014142 = 230.78 → plus 0.163 * 0.0014142 ≈ 0.0002307 → so tau ≈ 230.78 years. But that's way longer than 83, which I calculated earlier. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In the case of v=0.999999c, which is about 0.999999 times c, the gamma factor (1/sqrt(1-v²/c²)) is about 2236. So time dilation is significant.

Wait, in that case, the time experienced by the astronaut would be t_earth / gamma. Because tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

So for v=0.999999c, gamma is about 2236. So tau = t_earth / 2236.

t_earth is D / v → D=163,000 ly → t_earth = 163,000 / 0.999999 → approx 163,000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 / 2236 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 2236 → 163000 ÷ 2236 → approx 72.9 years.

Ah, so if v is 0.999999c, then tau is about 72.9 years, which is close to option B)72. But the problem states the speed is 0.99999987c, which is even closer to c, so gamma would be higher, making tau even shorter. Wait, wait, no, wait: higher speed implies higher gamma, so tau would be shorter. Wait, no, wait. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So as v approaches c, gamma increases. So higher speed → higher gamma → tau = t_earth / gamma → smaller tau.

Wait, but in the earlier case with v=0.99999987c, the gamma would be higher than when v=0.999999c. So tau would be even smaller. But earlier when I computed v=0.99999987c, I got tau around 83 years. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma for v=0.99999987c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1 / 5.099e-4 → approx 1960. So tau = t_earth / gamma.

t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ) → 163,000.021 years.

So tau = 163000.021 / 1960 → approx 83.13 years.

Wait, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. So in that case, the astronaut's time is about 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem intended the closer speed, like 0.999999c, which would give tau around 72 years, option B. But the given speed is 0.99999987c, which is even closer to c, making gamma even higher, and thus tau shorter. Wait, no, no—wait, higher gamma would make tau even smaller. Wait, no: because tau = t_earth / gamma. So higher gamma → smaller tau. So if I'm using v=0.99999987c, which has a higher gamma than v=0.999999c, then tau would be lower than 72.9 years. Wait, no, no—earlier with v=0.999999c, I got tau≈72.9 years. With v=0.99999987c, gamma is higher, so tau is smaller.

Wait, but earlier I computed for v=0.99999987c, the tau was about 83 years, which is longer than 72.9. That must be a mistake. Because higher speed should lead to higher gamma and thus lower tau.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me recompute with v=0.99999987c and D=163,000 ly.

Compute gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.

t_earth = D / v = 163000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163000 * (1.00000013) ) → 163000 + 0.021 → 163000.021 years.

tau = t_earth / gamma = 163000.021 / 1960 → let's compute.

163000 / 1960 → 163000 ÷ 1960 → 163000 ÷ 1960 = (163000 ÷ 100) * (100/1960) → 1630 * (100/1960) → 1630 * (5/98) → approx 1630 * 0.05102 → 1630 * 0.05 = 81.5 → 1630 *0.00102 = 1.6626 → total approx 83.1626 years.

So tau is about 83 years. But with v=0.999999c, gamma is about 2236. So t_earth would be D/v → 163000 / 0.999999 → approx 163000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 / 2236 → approx 72.9 years.

So in the given problem, the speed is 0.99999987c, which is faster than 0.999999c. So gamma is higher, so tau is smaller. Wait, because 0.99999987 is closer to c than 0.999999.

Wait, but wait: in my calculation above, v=0.99999987c gave tau=83, which is longer than 72.9. That can't be right because higher gamma should make tau shorter. So I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I inverted gamma and something else. Let me think again. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So as v increases, gamma increases. So for a higher v, gamma is higher, meaning tau is t_earth / gamma → smaller tau.

So for v=0.999999c, gamma is 2236, leading to tau=72.9 years. For v=0.99999987c, gamma is higher, say around 1960? No, wait, no: v=0.99999987c is higher than v=0.999999c, so gamma should be higher.

Wait, no. Let me compute gamma for v=0.99999987c. 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 → 0.00000026. So sqrt(0.00000026)= 5.099e-4.

Gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 → 1 / 0.0005099 → approximately 1960.

Wait, but for v=0.999999c, v^2 is 0.9999980001, so 1 - v²/c² = 0.0000019999, so sqrt that is 0.0014142, so gamma is 1/0.0014142 → 707. But I thought earlier it was 2236.

Wait, no, 0.0014142 is sqrt(0.000002), which is 0.0014142, gamma = 1 / 0.0014142 ≈ 707. So for v=0.999999c, gamma is about 707, not 2236. Earlier I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I think I mixed up v=0.999999c and v=0.9999999999c. Let me correct this.

At v=0.999999c, 1 - v²/c²=1 - (0.999999)^2= 1 - 0.9999980001= 0.0000019999.

So sqrt(0.0000019999)= approx 0.0014142.

Gamma = 1 / 0.0014142 ≈ 707.

So for v=0.999999c, gamma is 707, tau = t_earth / 707.

t_earth = D / v = 163000 / 0.999999 → approx 163000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 / 707 → approx 230 years. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no—tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is t_earth * 0.0014142.

t_earth = 163000 / 0.999999 → approx 163000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 * 0.0014142 → approx 163000 * 0.0014142 = 230.7 years. Wait, that's a long time.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the proper time tau is given by tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is t_earth multiplied by the Lorentz factor's reciprocal.

So, for v=0.999999c, which gives sqrt(1-v²/c²)=0.0014142, so tau = t_earth * 0.0014142.

t_earth = D / v → 163000 / 0.999999 → 163000.163 years.

tau = 163000.163 * 0.0014142 → 163000 * 0.0014142 ≈ 230.7 years. That can't be right, because the astronaut would have a longer time than the Earth frame, which doesn't make sense. Because tau should be less than t_earth.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. The proper time is the shortest time between two events, so tau should be less than t_earth. But in this calculation, it's coming out longer. Something's wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, for high velocities, the Earth observes the spaceship taking t_earth years, while the spaceship's crew experiences less time due to time dilation. So tau should be less than t_earth.

Wait, so for v=0.999999c, tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → t_earth is 163000 / 0.999999 → approx 163,000.163 years.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.0000019999) → approx 0.0014142.

So tau = 163000.163 * 0.0014142 → approx 230.7 years. But that's longer than t_earth, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, no. Because t_earth is the time in Earth's frame, which is longer. The proper time tau must be less than t_earth.

Ah, wait! No, no. Because for the spaceship, the distance is contracted. So from the spaceship's frame, the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is D * 0.0014142. So D' is 163000 * 0.0014142 ≈ 230.7 ly.

So time experienced is D' / v → 230.7 / 0.999999c → approx 230.7 years. So that's the same as tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is 163000 * 0.0014142 ≈ 230.7.

Wait, but this is longer than the Earth's frame time, which can't be right. Because the spaceship is moving towards Earth, so the time should be less.

Wait, no, no—Earth's frame time is 163000.163 years, which is much longer than 230 years. So tau is 230 years, which is less than t_earth. That makes sense.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try with v=0.999999c.

v=0.999999c → gamma is 707.

t_earth = D / v → 163000 / 0.999999 → 163,000.163 years.

tau = t_earth / gamma → 163,000.163 / 707 → approx 230.7 years.

But how can this be? Because the ship is moving towards Earth, so the trip time should be less than what Earth measures.

Ah, wait, no. From Earth's frame, the ship takes 163,000 years to reach Earth. From the ship's frame, the Earth is approaching at v, so the distance is contracted, so the time is less. So yes, 230 years is less than 163,000 years. That makes sense.

Wait, but that's for v=0.999999c. Now, for v=0.99999987c, let's compute gamma again.

v=0.99999987 → v²=0.99999974000001 → 1 - v²=0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026)=0.0005099.

Gamma = 1/0.0005099 → approx 1960.

t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163,000.021 years.

tau = t_earth / gamma → 163000.021 / 1960 → approx 83.13 years.

So tau is about 83 years. The astronaut is 22, so he'd be 105 when he arrives, which is within his 150-year lifespan. So he survives.

But the options don't have 83. The closest option is C)81.

Perhaps the intended approach is to compute the time experienced by the astronaut using the formula tau = D / (v * gamma), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the time from Earth's frame and then applying time dilation. But in that case, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that when v is very close to c, the time experienced by the astronaut is D/(c * gamma), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: using the formula tau = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

So, tau = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

With D=163000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

Compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 5.099e-4.

So tau = 163000 *5.099e-4 / 0.99999987.

5.099e-4 is 0.0005099.

So 163000 * 0.0005099 = 82.897.

Divide by 0.99999987 → 82.897 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.897 *1.00000013 → approx 82.897 + 0.000108 → 82.898 years.

So approximately 83 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation that when v is very close to c, the time experienced is approximately D/(c * gamma), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider using the exact formula for gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

But perhaps for v=0.99999987c, the gamma is about 1960, so tau = t_earth / gamma → t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163000.021 years.

So tau = 163000.021 / 1960 ≈ 83.13 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. If the distance were 163,000,000 km, that would be different, but no, it's 163,000 light-years.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers Earth and the LMC as being much closer. Maybe 100,000 light-years. Let me try that.

D=100,000 ly.

t_earth = 100,000 / 0.99999987 → approx 100,000 * 1.00000013 → 100,000.13 years.

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 100,000.13 * 0.0005099 → approximately 50.99 years.

Which is about 51 years, but that's not an option either.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the time is about 83 years, but the closest option is C)81. Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach is to approximate the time without considering the Earth's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Let's think about the time from the astronaut's perspective.

The astronaut's speed is 0.99999987c, so D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 82.897 ly.

Time experienced is D' / v → 82.897 ly / (0.99999987c) → approx 82.9 years.

So the answer would be approximately 83 years, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81, which is the closest to 83.

Alternatively, perhaps I should round to the nearest option, which would be 83 to 81, but that's a big jump.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my time frame.

Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the time using the formula tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → which is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c^2).

So for D=163000 ly, v=0.99999987c, sqrt(1 - v²/c^2)=0.0005099.

t_earth = 163000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163000.021 years.

tau = 163000.021 * 0.0005099 → 163000 * 0.0005099 → 82.897 years.

So 82.897 ≈ 83 years.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate the time using the formula tau ≈ D/(c * gamma), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different distance, but without knowing, I can't proceed.

Given that, I think the intended answer is option C)81 years, but according to my calculations, it's approximately 83 years. However, since 83 is not an option, I might have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of Earth's frame time without considering time dilation, which would be about 163,000 years, which is way longer than the astronaut's lifespan, leading him to die. But that would be option A.

But that can't be right, because the astronaut's own time is shorter. So he would survive, which would make the correct answer not A.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the ship's speed as 0.99999987c, but relative to the LMC, not Earth. Wait, that complicates things, but I don't think that's the case.

In conclusion, despite some confusion and possible miscalculations, I think the correct answer based on the given options is option C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using relativistic time dilation and length contraction principles. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth is approximately \( D = 163,000 \) light-years.

### Key Equations and Concepts:
1. **Time Dilation**: The proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time (\( t \)) measured in Earth's frame by:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
2. **Earth Frame Time**: The time measured in Earth's frame is:
   \[
   t = \frac{D}{v}
   \]
3. **Length Contraction**: From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted:
   \[
   D' = D \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   The time experienced by the astronaut is then:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{D'}{v}
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Earth Frame Time**:
   \[
   t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \approx 163,000.021 \, \text{years}
   \]

2. **Time Dilation Factor**:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099
   \]

3. **Proper Time**:
   Using the time dilation formula:
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000.021 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 83.13 \, \text{years}
   \]

4. **Verification via Length Contraction**:
   Contracted distance:
   \[
   D' = D \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 82.897 \, \text{light-years}
   \]
   Time experienced by the astronaut:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{D'}{v} = \frac{82.897}{0.99999987} \approx 82.9 \, \text{years}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut experiences approximately \( 83 \) years of travel time. However, the closest option provided is \( 81 \) years. Given the approximations and rounding in the problem, \( 81 \) years is the most reasonable choice.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth**: Incorrect. The astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, and they would survive the \( 83 \)-year journey.
- **B) 72 years**: Incorrect. This value is too low compared to the calculated \( 83 \) years.
- **C) 81 years**: Correct. This is the closest to the calculated \( 83 \) years.
- **D) 77 years**: Incorrect. This value is also too low.

### Final Answer:
The astronaut's travel time from their perspective is approximately \( 81 \) years.
