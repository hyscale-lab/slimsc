Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove gas molecules so that electron microscopy is better because there's less scattering.

But, even after doing all that, some gas particles are still there, as the mass spec detected. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, not λ1. And the temperature stayed the same, so that's not changing. So, why did λ change?

Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is given by the formula λ = 1/(n * π * d^2 / 4), where n is the number density of the gas molecules and d is their diameter. Alternatively, I think it can also be expressed using pressure and other factors.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the mean free path λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter, and P is pressure. Or wait, maybe it's λ = (2 * k * T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P) ). Or perhaps the mean free path is inversely proportional to the product of pressure and the square root of temperature? Or wait, let's think again: The mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure and directly proportional to the square root of temperature. Because higher pressure means more molecules, so shorter mean free path. Higher temperature would make molecules move faster, so on average they can travel further before a collision.

Wait no, wait. The mean free path actually depends on the mean velocity of the molecules. And the mean velocity is proportional to sqrt(T). So if temperature increases, the mean free path should increase because molecules are moving faster and can go longer before hitting another molecule.

But in this scenario, the temperature is the same. So why does the mean free path change?

Wait, the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated under the vacuum state. But when the electron beam is turned on, what happens? The electron beam has a high energy, right? So the electrons are moving very fast—close to the speed of light perhaps.

Now, when the electrons are moving, they can interact with the gas molecules. But wait, the gas molecules are at rest (or moving at thermal speeds), and the electrons are moving much faster. So the electrons' motion would cause the gas molecules to scatter, but actually, it's the gas molecules that are in the path of the electrons.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, λ1 was based on the gas molecules' average movement. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving, so maybe the gas molecules are now moving towards the electrons as well, or perhaps the relative speed is higher.

Wait,
