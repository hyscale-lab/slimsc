Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product 3. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me think about each step.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually happens in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is an activating group. The nitration would add a nitro group. The methyl is an ortho/para director, so the nitro group will probably go in the para position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, right? The structure would be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group opposite each other.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions, I think it oxidizes the methyl group. Wait, toluene's methyl under strong oxidation typically becomes a carboxylic acid. So the methyl group would oxidize to a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. The structure is a benzene ring with a nitro group and a carboxylic acid group opposite each other.

Third step: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Oh, I remember the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. That's when a ketone (like acetone) reacts with an aromatic aldehyde under basic conditions to form a α,β-unsaturated ketone. Wait, but product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, is there a carbonyl group available?

Wait, product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid, which has a COOH group. But the Claisen-Schmidt typically involves an aldehyde or ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Oh wait, another possibility is that the carboxylic acid could be involved in some reaction. But I'm not sure. Wait, acetone is a ketone; maybe it's a crossed aldol addition?

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is first converted into an acid chloride or something else. But the question says it's treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH. So maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution? Or perhaps it's the formation of an enolate.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think about each step again.

Product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid: structure is benzene with NO2 and COOH groups para to each other.

When you treat a benzoic acid with a base and a ketone, maybe it's undergoing some condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is converted to its sodium salt, acting as a nucleophile. Or maybe it's the formation of a beta-keto acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reagents: acetone and aqueous NaOH. Acetone is (propan-2-one). Under basic conditions, it can form an enolate. So perhaps the benzoic acid is being decarboxylated or something.

Wait, another thought: the treatment of a nitro group in the presence of certain reagents might lead to reduction. But wait, the third step is with MnO2 and H2SO4? No, no, the second step was with MnO2 and H2SO4. The third step is acetone and NaOH. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about product 2. Para-nitrobenzoic acid has two substituents on the benzene ring: NO2 and COOH. Now, when treated with acetone and NaOH, perhaps the COOH group is deprotonated to form the carboxylate ion. Then, perhaps it undergoes a nucleophilic attack or some kind of substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is being reduced. But I don't think so because the reagents here are not a reducing agent. Wait, MnO2 is an oxidizing agent. Maybe the third step is a condensation reaction.

Wait, another approach
