Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ,θ). The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency or something like that. Oh right, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The formula I think is P = ( ( (e^2 a^2 ) / (6πε₀ c^3) )) where a is the acceleration. But wait, this is for a point dipole. But in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal, so maybe it's a dipole oscillation.

But more importantly, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is directional. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) depends on the angle θ. The radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees, I believe. So the intensity pattern is maximum at the equator and falls off as you go towards the poles.

Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula I = I₀ ( 1/(4π) ) ( (2 cos²θ + 1) ) something? Or wait, maybe it's I = (something) * sin²θ. Wait, no. Let me think again. Oh right, the radiation pattern for an electric dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees and zero at θ=0 and 180 degrees.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, maybe it's the magnetic dipole that has a different pattern. Hmm. Oh wait, dipole radiation is usually considered as electric dipole radiation, particularly in the context of antennas and such. For an electric dipole, the far field (radiation) has a pattern with maxima at θ = 90 degrees. The intensity
