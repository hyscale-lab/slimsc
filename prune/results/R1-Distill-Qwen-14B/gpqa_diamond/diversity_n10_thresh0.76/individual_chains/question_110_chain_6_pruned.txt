Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs, but I need to think about their specific capabilities.

The question gives some information about the brightness each can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17, so that's up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, wait, wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed with HIRES." Wait, but wait: usually, lower magnitude means brighter, right? Because magnitude is inverse. So a star that's magnitude 15 is brighter than a 16. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag <=17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V mag <=16 can be observed. Because "brighter than 17" would be magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17.

So a star can be observed by both if its apparent V magnitude is <=16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So any star that's brighter than V=16 (i.e., V<=16) can be seen by both. But wait, let me double-check: the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means V < 17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V <17. HIRES can detect stars with V <16. So for both, the star's V needs to be less than 16. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V magnitude less than 16.

Wait, wait, but looking at the options, each star has either an absolute magnitude or apparent magnitude. So I need to compute the apparent magnitude for each star, considering distance and any extinction (dust reddening) if applicable.

Let me go through each star.
