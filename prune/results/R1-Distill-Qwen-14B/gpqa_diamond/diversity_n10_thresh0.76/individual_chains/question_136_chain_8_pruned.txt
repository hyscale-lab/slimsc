Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. 

Alright, the setup: the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². And the magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r². Also, it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, the vector field is purely radial and its magnitude is 1/r². 

Wait, but wait. Vector fields can have components in different directions. Here, since it's in spherical coordinates, the field is only along the radial direction. So, in spherical coordinates, the vector field would have only the r-component, which is f_r = 1/r², and the other components (theta and phi) are zero.

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere of radius R. So, the integral is ∫∫∫ (volume) [∇ · f] dV. 

Hmm, I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. For a vector field with only the radial component, the divergence simplifies. Let me recall. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/sinθ d/dθ (f_θ sinθ)) ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/dφ (f_φ)) ). But since f only has the radial component, the other terms are zero. So, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

So substituting f_r = 1/r², let's compute that. 

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] = (1/r²) d/dr (1). Wait, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So, ∇·f = 0? So, the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

Wait, wait a second. But if the field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, then that's a radial vector field. The divergence would be zero everywhere except at r=0. Because, at r=
