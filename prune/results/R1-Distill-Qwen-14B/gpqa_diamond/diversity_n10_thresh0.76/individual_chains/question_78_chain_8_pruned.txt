Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain time t. The setup is that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a point r. The vector d is the distance from where the field was generated at time tr (which is earlier than t) to the observation point r. The velocity at the field-generating time is v.

Wait, I remember that when charges are moving, you have to consider both the electric and magnetic fields. For a stationary charge, the scalar potential is straightforward—just Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion.

I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is still given by the Coulomb potential but evaluated at the retarded position. Oh wait, right, the retarded time is the time when the field was actually generated at point r. So, the potential V would be q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But wait, in the problem statement, d is the vector from the field generation point to r. So, d would be r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position at tr. So the magnitude of d would be the distance between the charge and the observation point at that earlier time.

Wait, but in the options, some have expressions involving d*c plus or minus the dot product of d and v. Oh right, that's because when dealing with potentials from moving charges, you have to account for the time delay and the velocity. 

Wait, I also remember the concept of retarded time. The time tr is the time when the charge was at position s(tr), and the field at r is observed at time t. The relation between t and tr comes from the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge's position to r. So, t = tr + (distance)/(c). So, the distance would be |d|, since d is the vector from the charge's position to r. So, the time difference is |d| / c. But I'm not sure if this comes into play in the potentials themselves or just in calculating when the fields are generated.

Now, about the potentials. The scalar potential V is usually given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c) t')], but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. No, wait, for the scalar potential, for a charge in motion, it's more involved. I think the scalar potential can be expressed as V = [q/(4πε₀)] * 1/(c² (t - t_r) - (d · v)/c ), or something similar. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Liénard potentials.

Oh yeah, the Liénard potentials! The scalar potential for a moving charge is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t)/(c²)) +
