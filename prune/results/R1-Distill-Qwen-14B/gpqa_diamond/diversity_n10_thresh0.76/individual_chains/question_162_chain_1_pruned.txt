Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think it through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I'm told to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere? I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, often associated with negative curvature. But how does that tie into the metric here?

Let me first parse the metric. It looks like a two-dimensional line element because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So maybe this is a 2D spacetime metric, but since we're talking about area, perhaps it's a spatial slice?

Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That 4 is 2², so 4 - x² - y² equals 4 - (x² + y²). So if x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive. But when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, which might cause some issues like singularities.

I think the area of a surface described by a metric is calculated using the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, in two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. But since the metric here is diagonal, the determinant is simply (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²), but because it's diagonal, g_xy = 0, so determinant is g_xx * g_yy.

Looking at the metric, it's written as ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in terms of tensor components, g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_xy = 0. Thus, the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the square root of the determinant would be sqrt([32/(...)]²) which is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, yeah, the area element is (32 dx dy)/(4 - x² - y²). So to calculate the area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined.

What's the region here? The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive to have a real metric. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So integrating over x and y from -2 to 2, but in polar coordinates that would be easier.

Let me switch to polar coordinates. x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The area element becomes (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ.

So the area A is the integral over θ from 0 to 2π
