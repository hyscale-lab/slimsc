Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question in front of me. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The question says they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against IKAROS in human B cells. Then they did sequencing, alignment, peak calling, but the peaks disappeared when they used PFA plus DSG fixation. So I'm trying to figure out where these peaks would be.

Wait, PFA is paraformaldehyde, right? It's a crosslinker. I think it's commonly used for fixing proteins to DNA. But wait, DSG is something else. Oh right, DSG is a reducing agent, like dithiothreitol. It helps in breaking disulfide bonds, maybe in proteins. So when you fix with PFA alone, it crosslinks proteins and DNA, but maybe not all regions are equally fixed or accessible.

The experiment shows that when they added DSG (so using PFA+DSG), the peaks from the ChIP-seq disappeared. What does that mean? I'm trying to recall how crosslinking affects ChIP-seq results. ChIP-seq relies on the antibody pulling down the protein-DNA complexes. If the crosslinking is too strong or not properly reversed, some DNA regions might not be released, leading to issues in sequencing.

Wait, but in this case, the peaks disappeared. So maybe the DSG treatment affected the binding sites. Alternatively, maybe the antibody isn't binding as efficiently when DSG is used. No, I think DSG
