Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So the situation is: an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since they are electron and positron, their annihilation should produce two photons because of conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, but why two photons? Oh right, because a single photon can't carry the necessary momentum if the initial particles are moving. So two photons are produced to balance things out.

Let me think about the conservation laws here. Both energy and momentum must be conserved in the system. So I need to calculate the total energy and momentum before the collision and then see what the photons' momenta must be.

First, Lorentz factor gamma is given for each particle. Gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their velocities are in opposite directions. Wait, no wait. Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so it's going towards the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so towards the left. So their directions are opposite.

Wait, but wait: the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So direction-wise, the electron is moving to the right (positive x), and the positron is moving to the left (negative x).

But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so it's moving in the negative x direction.

So their momenta are opposite in direction.

Each has a certain energy and momentum. Let's consider their rest masses. The rest mass of an electron (and positron) is m_e. So each has rest energy m_e c².

The electron's Lorentz factor is gamma_e =4. So its energy is gamma_e * m_e c² =
