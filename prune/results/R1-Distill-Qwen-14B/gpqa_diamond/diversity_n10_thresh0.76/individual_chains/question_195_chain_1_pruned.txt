Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. It's orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on some of these terms. Let me break it down. When a planet transits its star, it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the distance (in terms of star's radius) from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path during transit. So, if the impact parameter is 0, the planet would pass directly in front of the center. A positive value means it's offset.

Occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our perspective. So for both transit and occultation to happen, the second planet must pass in front of and behind the star as seen from Earth. But wait, the transiting planet is the first one, so the second planet is another one in the same system. Oh, but the problem says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So when the second planet transits, we see it in front of the star, and when it's behind, we see occultation.

Wait, but for occultation, the planet has to be smaller than the star, right? Because if it's larger, it might not go completely behind. Hmm, but in this case, the planet's radius is 2.5 Earth radii. Let me see: the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. Let's convert everything into the same units for comparison.

Wait, the Sun's radius is about 109 Earth radii. So 1.5 times that is 163.5 Earth radii
