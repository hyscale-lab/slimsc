Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky for me because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and molecular symmetries. But I'll take it step by step.

Let me read the question again carefully. The problem describes a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to map out the reactions based on the given information. So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A and two acids: F (a strong acid) and G (a weak acid). Additionally, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what these compounds are. Let me list out the possible reactions and products.

The first reaction: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is bright red. That makes me think of metals reacting with something. Wait, maybe A is a metal oxide? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a halogen or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen gas. For example, like in the formation of a metal halide. But then, 8 equivalents? That's a lot. For example, if A is iron (Fe), and B is chlorine gas (Cl2), reacting in a certain ratio. Wait, iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3, but that's 3 Cl per Fe. Hmm, 8 equivalents would mean a higher ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na), a solid, and B is chlorine. Sodium reacts with Cl2 to form NaCl. The reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na, so 1 equivalent maybe? But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents, so that's 8 moles of B per mole of A. So perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2. So, for
