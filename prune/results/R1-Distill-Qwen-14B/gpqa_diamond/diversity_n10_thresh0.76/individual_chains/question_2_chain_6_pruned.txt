Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then, each product is formed through a series of reactions. The question is asking about the number of carbon atoms in product 3. The options are A) 14, B) 10, C) 12, D) 11.

Hmm, I think I'll need to break down each reaction step by step.

First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide to form product 1. I remember that Grignard reagents like methyl magnesium bromide add to aldehydes. So, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. Its structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CHO but wait, no, wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, I think I'm mixing that up. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is derived from cinnamic acid, which is benzene with a propenoic acid group. So, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So structure: benzene ring connected to CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cinnamic acid is Ph-CH₂-COOH; so cinnamaldehyde would be Ph-CH₂-CHO? Or is it Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Let me get this straight. The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So it's CH₂=CH–CHO, but the CH₂ is attached to a phenyl group. Wait, no. Let me draw it. The aldehyde group is at one end, then a double bond, and a benzene ring on the other. So, structure is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, that's not right. I think it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO is more like
