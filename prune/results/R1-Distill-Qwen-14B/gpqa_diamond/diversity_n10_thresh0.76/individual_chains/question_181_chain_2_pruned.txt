Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let's see, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core, and what the flux ratio between two energy bands would be.

First, I need to understand what the pp-III branch is. From what I remember, the proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch involves reactions that produce carbon-12, which then goes into the CNO cycle. Oh wait, wait. No, wait, the main proton-proton chain is pp-I, which produces helium-4. Then, in pp-II, there's a reaction where a helium-4 captures two protons to form beryllium-7, which then captures an electron to become lithium-7, and then goes to helium-4 again. Hmm, but I might be mixing up the details. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is another part of the proton-proton chain? Or perhaps pp-III is a specific part of the CNO cycle? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact distinctions here.

Wait, the question specifies that the pp-III branch stopped. So, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for a specific part of the neutrino production. I think that the dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh, wait, no, the pp-I chain might not produce the highest energy neutrinos. Or maybe the neutrinos come from different parts of the reactions.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily by the pp reactions. So, the pp chain has multiple steps. The main process is the proton-proton chain, which produces helium-4. In the first part, two protons fuse to deuterium, then another proton adds to make helium-3, and then two helium-3's fuse into helium-4, and in doing so, emit two positrons and two neutrinos. So each helium-4 produced gives off two neutrinos. But wait, no, wait: in the pp-I branch, the steps are 1H + 1H â†’ 2H (deuterium) + positron + neutrino. Then, another proton fuses with deuterium
