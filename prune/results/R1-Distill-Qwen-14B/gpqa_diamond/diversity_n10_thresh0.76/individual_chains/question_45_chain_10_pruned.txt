Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is asking about the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies. The options are given in terms of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = (n²) * E for each particle. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

Wait, but wait. These are spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so each quantum state can be occupied by at most one particle. But in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just n, and spin is also a factor. So each particle's state is determined by both n and the spin state. Spin-1/2 has two possible states: up and down. So for each n, there are two possible states. That means that each n can have two particles, each with opposite spins.

So, for four particles, how do their quantum numbers and spins arrange?

First, the ground state. Ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So each particle will occupy the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion. Since each n can have two particles (because of spin), the first few n's would be filled up.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. For four particles, each with spin up or down, so each n can take two spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy a single n is two. So let's list the possible n's and how many particles are in each.

Ground state: The lowest energy level is n=1. Since spin allows two particles, n=1 can hold two particles. Then the next lowest is n=2, which can also hold two particles. So in the ground state, particles are filled up to n=2. So two in n=1 (each with opposite spins), and two in n=2, each with opposite spins as well.

Wait, but wait. Wait, another thought. For four particles, each state can hold two, so maybe the first two n's (n=1 and n=2) each have two particles. So the total energy
