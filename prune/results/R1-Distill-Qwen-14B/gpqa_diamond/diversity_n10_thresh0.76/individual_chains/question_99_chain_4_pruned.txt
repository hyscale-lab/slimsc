Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let's break it down.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like from a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, and the strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid since they have a carbonyl. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. The question says none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups, like no alkenes.

The NMR spectrum has some complex splitting. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds like there are some adjacent protons causing splitting. Let's think about symmetry. If the structure is symmetric, maybe some of the protons are equivalent, which would simplify the splitting.

Looking at the options, all the compounds are substituted butanoic acids or something similar. Let's structure each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, that would be like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2 groups attached to the central carbons. Wait, maybe it's more like CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a methyl group (maybe ethyl?) and two hydrogens.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So, structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, so the COOH is at the end, and the two central carbons each have an ethyl group and a hydrogen.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, that's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the middle two carbons each have a
