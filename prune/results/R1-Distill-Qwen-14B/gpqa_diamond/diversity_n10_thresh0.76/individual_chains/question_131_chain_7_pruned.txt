Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the question.

The problem begins with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, the structure must have two carboxylic acid groups and a double bond in the cis configuration. When this is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 1H NMR at 7 ppm suggests possibly an aromatic proton or maybe some kind of conjugated system. But wait, since it's an anhydride, maybe the carbonyl groups are involved. The 13C NMR peaks: 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to a double bond (like an sp² carbon), and 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon, maybe from the anhydride groups.

So, the anhydride structure probably has two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge, and maybe an adjacent double bond. Since the original compound was a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride where the double bond is now part of the ring structure, perhaps a cyclic anhydride. Wait, a cyclic anhydride is formed when the acid loses water between two carboxylic acid groups. So, maybe it's a succinic anhydride derivative, but with a cis double bond.

Wait, but succinic anhydride is a five-membered ring. If the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, then perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with a double bond. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think.

When the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, it yields two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key here is that the reaction is likely a Diels-Alder reaction because 1,3-cyclopentadiene is
