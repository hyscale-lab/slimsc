Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the concentration of that complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give me the stability constant, K_ca-edta, which is 5x10^10. The options are from A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The Ca-EDTA complex is the form where EDTA is attached to Ca²+. So the complex is CaY²- maybe? I think EDTA has multiple binding sites, so it forms a stable complex with metal ions.

The stability constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. So in this case, K is 5e10, which is really large. That suggests that the complex doesn't break down much, so most of the EDTA is tied up with Ca²+.

Wait, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So that's the concentration of the complex in solution. But I'm being asked about the concentration of free calcium ions. So, I need to find [Ca²+] in the solution.

I think the reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and the stability constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in reality, EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form, depending on the pH. Since the pH is ideal, I guess the pH is such that EDTA is in its most suitable form, probably the deprotonated one which can bind Ca²+ effectively. So I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA here.

So the solution is mostly the complex. Since K is so large, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So [Ca²+] would be very low, because almost all the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Wait
