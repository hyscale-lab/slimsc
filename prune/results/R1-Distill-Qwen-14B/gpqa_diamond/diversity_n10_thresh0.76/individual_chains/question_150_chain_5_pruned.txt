Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which gives 4) and either an aldehyde (1) or maybe a ketone plus a double bond, but aldehyde is more likely given the data.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons usually don't have neighboring protons because they're at the end. So maybe that's a conjugated system? Or perhaps it's an alpha proton, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Or wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Could it be an amine? No, amines are usually lower ppm. Hmm.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 ppm must be the aldehyde proton. Oh wait! Wait, maybe it's not a simple aldehyde. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Because in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 9.8-10. But if there's an adjacent group, like a double bond, could that cause splitting? Or if the aldehyde is conjugated with an aromatic ring, maybe through a double bond. Let me think: if the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, perhaps the proton is split by adjacent protons. For example, if it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, the aldehyde proton might couple with the vinyl protons. But in that case, the aldehyde is at the end, so it would be a triplet if the adjacent proton is a doublet. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let's go through the NMR data again:

- 9.72 (t, 1H): Aldehyde proton, maybe.
- 6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe aromatic protons.
- 6.51 (d, 2H): Another doublet, perhaps para-substituted on a benzene ring.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe exchangeable protons like -OH, but wait, 2H. Alternatively, some vinyl protons with broad peaks. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some coupling.
- 3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet, probably two protons next to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a methylene group attached to a carbonyl.

Putting this together: the aldehyde proton suggests an aldehyde group. The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be a CH2 group next to oxygen, perhaps as part of a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So, maybe there's a benzene ring (6 C), then a side chain with 2 C, maybe including the aldehyde, and the nitrogen and oxygen elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings. Wait, no, because that would require more carbons. Let me think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So each benzene ring is 6 C. But 8-6=2, so maybe one benzene ring and a two-carbon chain with some functional groups. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 (1H) which is probably the aldehyde H. Then, looking at the other peaks, the 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets. That makes me think of a para-substituted benzene ring. Each of those is a pair of protons across from each other, like in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the molecule is a diphenyl compound?

Wait, the compound is C8H9NO. If there's a benzene ring (6 C), then 2 more C. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a side chain of two carbons, including a functional group. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzalacetophenone? No, maybe not. Alternatively, think about the reagents given. The reaction starts with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

Ah! Those reagents are indicative of a diazotization reaction. NaNO2 and HCl are used to form a diazonium salt. Then, H2O (maybe a hydrolysis step)? Or perhaps the third step is more telling. The third step is aqueous KOH and heat, which is typical for the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to form a phenol or for a Sandmeyer-like reaction.

Wait, but the starting reagent is a diazotization. So the compound must have an aromatic amine, probably. Because diazotization is for aromatic amines. Hmm. So the original compound must have an amino group (-NH2) somewhere. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the possible functional groups.

Wait, the formula has one N and one O. So if it's an aromatic amine, then the structure would have a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But then after diazotization, it would form a diazonium chloride, which can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that suggest an NH2 group. NH2 protons typically are broad and around 1-5 ppm, but in the given data, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's something else, like OH groups.

Wait, could the initial compound be a benzylamine derivative? Or perhaps a secondary amine? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the amine is part of a ring. Wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, let me think about the reagents again. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is for diazotization. This requires an aromatic amine. So the initial compound must have an amino group attached to a benzene ring. So the structure is likely an aniline derivative.

But when I look at the NMR, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be a pair of NH protons. If so, but in aniline, the NH is usually a broad peak around 5-6 ppm. Wait, but in the given data, it's at 6.27, which is closer to aromatic protons. So maybe it's not NH. Alternatively, maybe it's an OH group. Wait, if the compound has two OH groups, then that would account for the 2H at 6.27 as a broad singlet. But that would require the compound to have two phenolic OH groups, which would be deprotonated under certain conditions.

Hmm, maybe the initial compound is a diphenylamine? Like diphenylamine has two benzene rings attached to an NH2 group. But that would give a molecular formula of C12H12N, which doesn't match our formula.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So let's think about the structure. Let's imagine a benzene ring with a substituent. Let's say a substituent that's a CH2-CHO group. Because the aldehyde would account for the 9.72 peak.

So, benzene ring with a CH2CHO group. So the formula would be C7H6O (benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but our formula is C8H9NO). Hmm, perhaps an amino group is present.

Wait, another approach: considering the reaction steps.

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is diazotization. So the starting compound must have an amino group on an aromatic ring. So the starting compound is an aniline derivative.

After diazotization, the next step is H2O. So maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions. For example, if the diazonium salt is treated with water, especially under acidic or basic conditions, it can form a phenol. Wait, but the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. So perhaps the diazonium salt is treated with a base, leading to a substitution reaction.

Wait, but let's think about the overall reaction steps. The initial compound is an aniline with some substituents. After forming the diazonium salt, perhaps it undergoes hydrolysis or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: after the diazonium salt is formed, in the presence of H2O, but more likely, maybe it's a hydrolysis to form a carbonyl group. Wait, for example, in the presence of H2O, sometimes the diazonium group can be replaced by an -OH group, leading to a phenol.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The first step is diazotization with
