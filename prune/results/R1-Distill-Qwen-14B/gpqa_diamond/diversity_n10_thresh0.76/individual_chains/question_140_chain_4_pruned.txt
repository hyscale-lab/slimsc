Alright, so I'm faced with this chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question involves several substances and reactions, so I'll try to piece together the information given.

First, the question mentions Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope substitution, making it heavier. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about possible gases where the number of neutrons and protons are the same.

Wait, if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, let's think about possible molecules. For a single atom, if the number of neutrons equals the number of protons, that must be for a hydrogen isotope. Because hydrogen has one proton. Let's see: if it's a molecule, maybe it's something like H2. But wait, each H atom has one proton and one neutron (if it's deuterium). So H2 could be either H2 or D2. Both have each H with 1 proton and 1 neutron for D. So for H2, each H has one neutron if it's protium, or two neutrons for deuterium. Wait no, if the gas is H2 and each H has 1 neutron, then each molecule has 2*(1 proton and 1 neutron) = 2 protons and 2 neutrons in total. But the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which is equal. So W could be H2, but that's probably not it because regular H2 doesn't have heavier isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule.

Wait, another possibility: what if W is CH4? No, because the number of protons and neutrons wouldn't match. Alternatively, CO2? No, same issue. Maybe another diatomic gas. Let me think: what about NH3? No, because that's not diatomic. Or maybe O2? Let's see: oxygen has 8 protons each. If it's O2, each O atom has 8 protons and let's say 8 neutrons (like the isotope O-16). So each molecule would
