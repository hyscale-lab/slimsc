Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chiral centers or some kind of symmetry that's broken. But wait, not all chiral centers mean optical activity. Sometimes molecules have multiple chiral centers but are meso compounds, so they aren't optically active. I need to check each compound one by one.

Let me list the compounds again:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one

Let's go through each.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (butene). The substituents on C1 are Cl, a methyl group (since it's but-1-ene, so C2 is CH2?), wait no, but-1-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond starting at C1. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-... Wait, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is at 1. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2 because it's but-1-ene. So the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2.

Wait, so structure is Cl-C(=CH2)-
