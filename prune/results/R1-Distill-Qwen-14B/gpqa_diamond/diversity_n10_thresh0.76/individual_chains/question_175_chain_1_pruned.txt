Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

The setup: It's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's probably symmetric around the z-axis, which might mean it's like an ellipsoid or something similar. Because it's oscillating, it radiates energy, and the wavelength is lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The question asks two parts. First, what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Second, what's the possible form of f as a function of lambda. The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda exponent.

I remember that for dipole radiation, the power pattern has a specific angular dependence. Wait, dipole radiation typically has a radiation pattern that depends on cosine theta squared. Oh right, the radiation intensity for an electric dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) or something like that. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the dipole radiation pattern is symmetric, and for a dipole aligned along the z-axis, the intensity varies with cos^2(theta). So maximum at the poles (theta=0 and theta=180) and zero at theta=90. But wait, waitâ€”no, wait, wait. Let me think again.

No, wait, no. I think the dipole radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (theta=90 degrees) because the magnetic field is strongest there. Or maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Wait, no. Wait, the radiation from a dipole is actually higher off the axis. Let me think: the intensity for a dipole radiating in the far field is proportional to (sin^2(theta)). Or is it (1 + cos^2(theta))? Wait, I thought the intensity pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity as a function of theta would peak at theta=90.

Wait, but the power per unit solid angle is given by the function f. So, for a dipole, the far field has a radiation pattern that's proportional to sin^2(theta) multiplied by some terms. Let me recall
