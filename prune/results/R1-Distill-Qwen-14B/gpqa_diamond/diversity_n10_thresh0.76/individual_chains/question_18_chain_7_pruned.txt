Okay, so I've got this problem here about two stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but let's try to work through this.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one it is.

First, let's list out the given data. Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But wait, do the masses matter here? Hmm, the question is about elemental abundances using LTE and the EW method. Oh right, the masses might affect their lifetimes and the processes that influence their compositions, but maybe for this problem, the masses aren't directly needed beyond the fact that they're not the Sun. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. The problem gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for both stars, which are their metallicity relative to the Sun. 

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, that simplifies to log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^-4.5. Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log(nMg/nH)= -5, so ratio is 10^-5.

Now, the stars' abundances are given as [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 dex. [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. [Fe/H]_1=0, meaning [Fe/Fe]_sun is same as the star's Fe relative to H. Wait, no. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 means Fe abundance is same as Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0, so Mg in Star_2 is same as in the Sun.

Wait, let me clarify. The [X/Y] notation is log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So [X/Y]_star = log(N_X/N_Y in star) - log(N_X/N_Y in Sun).

So, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(Fe/H in star) = log(Fe/H in Sun). So Fe is same as Sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 implies [Fe/Fe] is same as Sun. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is [Fe/H], so when [Fe/H]=0, Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg abundance same as Sun.

Now, the question is about the [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in the stars.

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Which means log(Si/Fe in Star_1) = log(Si/Fe in Sun) + 0.3. Wait no, the definition is [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi/nFe in Star_1) - log(nSi/nFe in Sun) = 0.3 → so nSi/nFe in Star_1 = 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe in Sun).

Wait no, let me get that right. [X/Y] = log ( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun ). So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so (Si/
