Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, the question says that the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to figure out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the relationship between energy and wavelength. Oh right, the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. The formula is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So higher energy means shorter wavelength.

But wait, the dye emits light, so that's fluorescence or something like that. I think when a substance absorbs light, it gets excited, and then emits light when it goes back to a lower energy state. So the emitted light's energy is lower than what was absorbed. Or wait, no, maybe the absorbed energy is higher. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state, then when it relaxes, it emits a photon with lower energy. So the emitted light would have lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy. So the emitted wavelength is longer than the absorbed. Or wait, no. Wait, if the dye emits light when it goes from a higher energy state to a lower one, but the question is about the absorbed light. So when the dye absorbs light, it's absorbing a photon of higher energy, uses that to get excited, and then emits a photon of lower energy when it relaxes.

So the energy emitted (2.3393 eV) is lower than the energy absorbed. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy. Therefore, the wavelength of the absorbed photon is shorter than the emitted.

So I need to find the wavelength of the emitted light first. Let me calculate that.

E = 2.3393 eV. I'll convert that to joules because I'm more familiar with the constants in those units. Oh wait, but maybe I can use the relation E (eV) = 1240 / wavelength (nm). Yeah, I think that's a handy formula. Because 1 eV is approximately 1.6e-19 J, but using 1240 eV·nm is easier here.

So wavelength λ = 1240 / E. E is 2.3393 eV.

Calculating that: 1
