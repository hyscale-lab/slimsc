Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs certain wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if the cloud is moving away, the light is redshifted, right?

So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift where these clouds can be detected. Oh, because if the redshift is too low, maybe the light shifts into the visible spectrum, which ground-based telescopes can't see because the atmosphere blocks UV. Wait, no, ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the ozone layer absorbs it. So if the Lyman-alpha line is redshifted into the optical range, then it can be observed.

Wait, what's the formula for redshift? The observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. So if the original wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and we want λ_obs to be in the optical range. Optical is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (which is 0.1216 nm, right?), so when it's redshifted, it moves to longer wavelengths. So for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it, the observed wavelength must be in the optical, which starts around 400 nm (which is 4000 Angstroms). So 4000 A is the lower end of what's detectable in optical?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the ground-based telescopes can't observe UV; the atmosphere blocks that. So for the Lyman-alpha line to be visible, it has to be redshifted into the visible. So let's compute when 1216 Ang becomes 400 nm (4000 A). So:

(1 + z) = λ_obs / λ_emit = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So z ≈ 2.29. So a redshift of around 2.3 would bring the line into the optical.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So if the cloud has a redshift higher than this, then the Lyman-alpha would be in the optical. So the lower limit is when the line is just entering the optical. So the minimum z is when λ_obs is 4000 A, which gives z = ~2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any z above that would be detectable.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29. So the lower limit for detection is when z is at least around 2.3. So the minimum z would be approximately 2.3, and the first option higher than that is option C.

But wait, another thought: what about if the cloud is at a z where Lyman-alpha is in the near-infrared? Oh wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe infrared either, except maybe in some cases. Wait, no, optical usually refers to visible light, which is about 400-700 nm. So if the Lyman-alpha is in the infrared, that's beyond the optical range. So the observed wavelength needs to be less than 700 nm, because beyond that is infrared, which isn't part of optical.

Wait, so maybe I should check both ends. For instance, if the redshift is higher, the wavelength would be longer than 700 nm (which is 7000 Angstroms). So:

If λ_obs is 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), then:

(1 + z) = 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.755, so z ≈ 4.755. So for z=4.755, the wavelength is at 700 nm, which is near-infrared, beyond optical. So for z less than that, the wavelength is within the optical.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the lower limit is when the wavelength is just entering the optical, which is z ≈ (4000/1216) - 1 ≈ 2.29. So any z above that would bring the Lyman-alpha into the optical.

So looking at the options, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Option C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29. So 2.4 would be a redshift where the Lyman-alpha is just entering the optical. So the lower limit is z ≥ 2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.3. So the lower limit is when z is at least 2.3, so the smallest possible z in the options that's bigger than 2.29 is option C) 2.4.

But wait, another point: the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Ang. If the cloud is at a certain redshift, the background quasar's light at that wavelength gets absorbed. So to detect the absorption, the quasar's light must have that wavelength. But quasars emit in the optical, but the absorption lines would be in the rest frame of the cloud.

Wait, no, the quasar's light is emitted in its own frame, but due to the expansion of the universe, the light we receive is redshifted. So for the Lyman-alpha line of the cloud to be in the observed optical, the quasar's light must have the Lyman-alpha line shifted into the optical.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. The cloud's hydrogen is neutral and absorbs at Lyman-alpha, which is 1216 Ang in their rest frame. So the quasar's light, when it passes through the cloud, any photons at 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame get absorbed. But when the quasar's light reaches us, it's been redshifted by the cloud's motion. So the wavelength at which absorption occurs in the quasar's frame is λ = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud), because the cloud is at redshift z_cloud.

Wait, no, the cloud's frame is moving away, so the quasar's rest frame is different. Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows: the quasar emits light, which is then absorbed by the intervening hydrogen cloud. The cloud has a redshift z_cloud, so the quasar's emitted light at wavelength λ_emit would be observed at λ_quasar = λ_emit * (1 + z_quasar). But the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, so the photon that's emitted at λ_quasar would be absorbed by the cloud if it's at 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame. So for the cloud to absorb a quasar's photon, the photon's wavelength in the cloud's frame must be 1216 Ang. That means, in the quasar's frame, the photon's wavelength is 1216 / (1 + z_cloud) Ang, because the cloud is moving away, so the photon is blueshifted in the cloud's frame compared to the quasar's frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The quasar emits a photon at wavelength λ_quasar_emit. The photon travels through the cloud, which is at redshift z_cloud. The cloud sees the photon at a wavelength λ_cloud = λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud) (since the photon is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe). For the photon to be absorbed by hydrogen in the cloud, λ_cloud must be 1216 Ang. So:

λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216 Ang.

But the quasar itself is at a redshift z_quasar. So the wavelength we observe from the quasar is λ_obs_quasar = λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_quasar).

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So in the quasar's frame, the emission is λ_quasar_emit. The cloud is at z_cloud, so the photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud). For absorption to happen at 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame, this must equal 1216 Ang. So:

λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216.

But the quasar is observed at a wavelength λ_obs_quasar = λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_quasar).

Now, the Lyman-alpha absorption line we observe in the quasar's spectrum is at the wavelength λ_obs = λ_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar) ? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the observed wavelength. The absorption line occurs at a wavelength that's the product of the quasar's redshift and the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud). No, wait, that can't be right because that would imply a multiplicative effect, which isn't correct in special relativity.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the observed wavelength and the redshift. The quasar is at a redshift z_q, so any emission from it is observed at λ = λ_emit * (1 + z_q). The Lyman-alpha absorption by a cloud at redshift z_c would occur at a wavelength λ_absorb = 1216 * (1 + z_c). But this absorption feature is observed at λ_obs = λ_absorb * (1 + z_q) – no, that doesn't seem right. Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of the photons' path.

Wait, the quasar emits a photon at wavelength λ_emit (in the quasar's frame). This photon travels toward us, passing through the hydrogen cloud which is at a redshift z_c. The photon's wavelength when it reaches the cloud is λ_emit * (1 + z_c). For the cloud to absorb it, this wavelength must be 1216 Ang. So:

λ_emit * (1 + z_c) = 1216 Ang.

Then, the photon continues to us, and because the quasar itself is at a redshift z_q, the photon's wavelength when we observe it is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z_q).

But we're interested in whether this photon, which was absorbed by the cloud, reaches us. Wait, no, the photon is absorbed, so we wouldn't see it. So perhaps the quasar's original light has the Lyman-alpha line at the cloud's z_c, and that line is shifted by the quasar's own redshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a different approach. The quasar's light is observed through the hydrogen cloud. The hydrogen cloud, at a redshift z_c, will absorb the quasar's light at a wavelength of 1216 Ang in the cloud's rest frame. So the quasar's rest frame emits light at wavelength λ_q = 1216 Ang. But the quasar itself is at a redshift z_q, so the observed wavelength of that emission is λ_q_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_q).

Wait, but we're looking for the absorption, not the emission. So the cloud's absorption occurs at a wavelength that, in the quasar's frame, is 1216 Ang / (1 + z_c), because the cloud is moving away, so the quasar sees the cloud's absorption at a shorter wavelength. Wait, no, in the quasar's frame, the cloud is moving away, so the photon that is at 1216 in the cloud's frame is at 1216/(1 + z_c) in the quasar's frame.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to model it with specific numbers.

Let's say the cloud is at a redshift z. So anything emitted at wavelength λ will be observed by us as λ*(1 + z). But in the cloud's frame, the quasar's emission is at λ_quasar = λ_emit_quasar*(1 + z_quasar). For the cloud to absorb that light at 1216 Ang in its own frame, the quasar's emission at that wavelength would have to be 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame. So if the quasar emits at λ_q, then in the cloud's frame, the wavelength is λ_q*(1 + z_cloud). And that should equal 1216 Ang.

So λ_q*(1 + z_cloud) = 1216.

But the quasar is at a redshift z_quasar, so the wavelength we observe from the quasar is λ_q_obs = λ_q * (1 + z_quasar).

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So when we observe the quasar, we see its spectrum with absorption lines shifted by the cloud's redshift. So the Lyman-alpha absorption line from the cloud is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) in our observed frame.

Wait, no. Let me think: the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. The quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar > z_cloud. So the light from the quasar, when it passes through the cloud, the cloud sees the quasar's light at a redshifted wavelength. So the photon that is absorbed by the cloud has a wavelength in the cloud's frame of 1216 Ang. So the wavelength in the quasar's frame is 1216/(1 + z_cloud), because the cloud is moving away.

But the quasar's own light is emitted at λ_quasar_rest, and when it reaches the cloud, it's been redshifted by z_cloud. So the wavelength at the cloud is λ_quasar_emitted * (1 + z_cloud). For that to be 1216 Ang:

λ_quasar_emitted * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216.

But the quasar is at a higher redshift, so when we observe the quasar's emission, the wavelength is λ_quasar_obs = λ_quasar_emitted * (1 + z_quasar).

But the absorption line that we observe is at the wavelength that the cloud absorbed it. So the cloud absorbed the photon at 1216 Ang in the cloud's frame, which corresponds to a wavelength of 1216/(1 + z_cloud) in the quasar's frame.

Wait, but that's the photon's wavelength in the quasar's frame before absorption. The quasar's own emitted light at that wavelength would be in the quasar's frame. But since the quasar is at z_quasar, the observed wavelength from the quasar is (1 + z_quasar) times the emitted wavelength.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the observed wavelength of the absorption line.

In our frame, the Lyman-alpha absorption from the cloud is at 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). Because the cloud's redshift is z_cloud.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the cloud is moving away, any emission or absorption line from it is redshifted by z_cloud. So the absorption line we see is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) Ang.

So for this absorption line to be in the optical range, which is roughly 4000 to 7000 Ang (400 nm to 700 nm), we need:

4000 ≤ 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) ≤ 7000.

So solving for (1 + z_cloud) ≥ 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292.

So z_cloud ≥ 2.292.

So the lower limit on z is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest one is option C, which is 2.4. So that's the minimal redshift, below which the absorption line would be in the UV, which can't be seen from the ground.

Wait, but option C is 2.4, which is larger than 2.29, so it's the minimum z that allows detection. So the answer should be C) 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman-alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted wavelength of the absorption line. Optical ground-based telescopes can only observe light in the visible spectrum, which corresponds to wavelengths approximately between 4000 Å (400 nm) and 7000 Å (700 nm). 

The observed wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z),
\]

where \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) is the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line, and \( z \) is the redshift of the cloud. For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the minimum redshift
The lower limit of the optical range is \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Substituting into the redshift formula:

\[
(1 + z) = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29.
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift is:

\[
z \geq 3.29 - 1 = 2.29.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the options
The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift such that the Lyman-alpha line can be detected. Any redshift \( z \geq 2.29 \) will place the absorption line in the optical range. Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated minimum redshift of 2.29 and is valid.
- **B) 1.2**: This is lower than 2.29, so it would place the absorption line in the ultraviolet (UV), which cannot be detected by optical ground-based telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is just above the calculated minimum redshift of 2.29 and is valid.
- **D) 1.9**: This is lower than 2.29, so it would also place the absorption line in the UV.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Among the options, the smallest value greater than this is **C) 2.4**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
