Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm. Let's start by recalling some basic concepts. Annihilation processes usually involve converting matter and antimatter into energy or other particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can assume that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy? Or wait, no, the problem says it's moving but not necessarily that it's low energy. Wait, the question says "slowly moving", which might imply that it's non-relativistic, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, but the antiproton and proton are colliding. Protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the proton is at rest, perhaps? Or is the antiproton moving towards a stationary proton? The question says "the antiproton is slowly moving," so I think the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but not too fast, maybe.

Wait, in annihilation processes when particles collide, conservation laws come into play: conservation of energy and momentum. So I'll need to use those. Let's think about the initial and final states.

Initial state: a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄) moving towards each other. Let's assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps it's the proton that's moving? Hmm, maybe I should clarify. The problem states, "the antiproton is slowly moving," so I think it's the antiproton that's moving, and the proton is stationary. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

Wait, but particles are annihilating. So in the initial state, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving. So their combined rest mass is 2m_p c², but the antiproton has kinetic energy as well. Alternatively, perhaps since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy, so maybe we can approximate it as being at rest? But the problem says it's moving, so perhaps we can't ignore its kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. Oh, wait, that's the rest mass of particle A. So each A has 300 MeV. The initial particles are protons, so m_p c² is about 938 MeV, I think. So each proton and antiproton has rest mass energy of 938 MeV. So the combined rest mass is 1876 MeV
