Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the question is about.

The question presents two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B. The options are given, and I have to choose which one is correct. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the first reaction:

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ â†’ A

Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base. But wait, the reaction also has H+ at the end. Oh right, sometimes after the base reaction, an acid workup is done. So maybe this is a deprotonation followed by some kind of reaction.

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is something like a bridge between two rings, and the vinyl group is attached to the bridgehead. The alcohol is at the same position as the vinyl group.

I think this structure has two rings: one is a 5-membered ring and the other a 3-membered? Or wait, no. The spiro notation [3.5] means one ring is size 3 and the other 5. So, the molecule is a spiro compound where one ring is a 3-membered cyclopropane and the other is a 5-membered ring. The vinyl group is attached to the bridgehead, which is the spiro carbon.

When such a compound is treated with a strong base like KH (which is a strong base, deprotonating things), maybe it undergoes some kind of elimination or cyclization.

Wait, the reaction conditions: THF is a solvent, and with a base. The starting alcohol is secondary or tertiary? Since it's on a bridgehead, maybe it's a hindered alcohol. Deprotonating it would give an alkoxide.

But wait, the reaction uses KH, which is a strong base, so it can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps, the alkoxide could attack somewhere else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a Cope elimination or some kind of ring-forming elimination.

Alternatively, do I remember anything about spiro compounds undergoing annulation reactions? Wait, annulation is the formation of a ring, especially a fused ring system. But wait, the starting material is already a spiro compound, so maybe it's undergoing a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which could then attack a neighboring position, leading to a ring contraction or expansion. Or maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger type reaction, but that involves ketones and ketone insertion.

Alternatively, I think of the possibility of an acid-catalyzed reaction, but here it's a base. Wait, but after the base treatment, there's an H+ step. So perhaps the base does something, and then an acid is added.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplic
