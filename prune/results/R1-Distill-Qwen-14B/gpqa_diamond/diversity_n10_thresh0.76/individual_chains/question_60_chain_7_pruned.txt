Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. Wow, that's like 99.999987% the speed of light. So time dilation must be significant here.

The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth. Wait, but wait—the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," so we're looking at the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

But wait, how do I find the proper time? Oh right, the proper time tau (τ) is related to the coordinate time (t) by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, is it the other way around? Because from the astronaut's frame, it's their proper time, so the time experienced is less than the time measured by someone else in a different frame. Or maybe I should think about the distance and how it appears to the astronaut.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. But the astronaut is 22, so that's probably a red h
