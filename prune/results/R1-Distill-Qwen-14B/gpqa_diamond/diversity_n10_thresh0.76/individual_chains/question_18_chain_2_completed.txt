Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the Equivalent Width (EW) method under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), astronomers have determined their elemental abundances. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, that is, [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or maybe [Si in Star_1] / [Si in Star_2]?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars. So I think the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_Si2), but I need to compute it using the given data.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(7.5-12) = 10^(-4.5) = about 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5) = 1e-5.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. For the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to some scale. Wait, the notation is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So the log is base 10, right? So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, normally [X/H] is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. Or is it 12 + log(nX/nH) for solar values? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.

Wait, the problem states that the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So 12 + log10(nFe/nH) equals 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Same for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → 1e-5.

So the solar values are nFeH_sun = 3.16e-5, nMgH_sun = 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1 and Star_2:

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. That means [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH)_star1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_star1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → so nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as the Sun. That's interesting.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which is log(nSi/nFe)_star1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. So, we can find nSi/nFe for Star_1.

Wait, but in the Sun, nSi/nFe is (nSiH_sun / nFeH_sun). Wait, no, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. So, for Star_1, nSi/nFe = 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but what's (nSi/nFe)_sun? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, nSi/nH is? Hmm, the problem doesn't directly give [Si/H] for the Sun. Wait, but perhaps I can compute it using the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, as established. But what about nSi/nH for the Sun? Hmm, the problem doesn't provide it, but perhaps we can calculate [Si/Fe]_sun as a reference.

Wait, the problem doesn't give [X/Fe] for the Sun, except for the two given. So perhaps I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data? Wait, no, because I don't have [Si/H]_sun. Hmm. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute [Mg/Si] ratios and find the silicon abundance.

Let me think. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg/nH)_2 - log(nMg/nH)_sun =0 → nMg/nH for Star_2 is same as Sun. So nMg/nH for Star_2 is 1e-5 (same as the Sun).

Wait, but Star_2 has [Mg/H] =0, so nMg/nH = 1e-5, same as Sun.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3 → nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

But what is (nMg/nSi)_sun? From the Sun's data, nMg/nH = 1e-5, and nFe/nH = 3.16e-5. But we need nSi/nH for the Sun. Oh wait, maybe we can find it via [Si/Fe]_1? Wait, no, [Si/Fe]_1 is for Star_1. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio. Because in the Sun, nMg/nH is 1e-5, and nFe/nH is 3.16e-5.

Wait, but I don't have nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm. Without that, perhaps I can't compute [Mg/Si]_sun, which is needed for Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2.

Wait, unless I can find nSi/nH for the Sun via another approach. Let me think. Let me see, perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, maybe I can express the ratios in terms of [X/H] and [X/Y] relations.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should approach it step by step for each star.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe/nH = same as Sun, so 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But what is (nSi/nFe)_sun? Let me compute that.

In the Sun, nSi/nH is... Hmm, I don't have that data. Wait, perhaps I can find nSi/nH from the Sun's photosphere. Let me think. The Sun's photosphere has a certain elemental composition. If I don't have [Si/H]_sun, maybe I can get it using the solar abundance, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach: Since I'm looking for the ratio of silicon in the two stars, perhaps I can express [nSi] for each star in terms of [Fe] and [Mg], and then find the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [nSi] in each star in terms of [nH], and then take the ratio.

Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe/nH (Star_1) = nFe/nH (Sun) = 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But I don't know (nSi/nFe)_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

nSi (Star_1) = nFe (Star_1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But without knowing (nSi/nFe)_sun, this might not help. Wait, but (nSi/nFe)_sun is the same as (nSi/nFe)_sun, which is log(nSi/nFe)_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun. But since we don't have [Si/Fe]_sun, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Mg/Si], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using the given data to find the ratios.

Let me outline the given data again:

Star_1:

- Mass: 1.5 Msun

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe/nH = nFeH_sun = 3.16e-5.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But again, without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? No, that's not correct. The Sun's [X/Fe] is typically close to zero for elements that are alpha elements, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe in the Sun, [Si/Fe] is about 0.3? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from solar abundances.

Wait, I recall that in the Sun, the abundance of Si is about 7.48e-5, and Fe is 3.16e-5. So nSi/nFe for the Sun would be 7.48e-5 /3.16e-5 ≈ 2.367 → log10(2.367) ≈ 0.373. So [Si/Fe]_sun ≈ 0.373. So maybe that's the value.

But since the problem doesn't provide it, maybe I can proceed without it, but perhaps I'm supposed to approximate it as zero? No, that doesn't make sense because the Sun's [Si/Fe] is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to somehow not need the Sun's [Si/Fe] value. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the [Mg/Si] ratios for each star and relate them to the overall silicon content.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2, and [Mg/H]_2=0. So let's see what that tells us about Star_2's Mg and Si.

Star_2's nMg/nH = same as Sun → 1e-5.

[ Mg/Si ]_2 = 0.3 → log( (nMg/nSi)_2 ) = 0.3 + log( (nMg/nSi)_sun )

But again, I don't know (nMg/nSi)_sun. Wait, but (nMg/nSi)_sun is (nMg/nH)/(nSi/nH) = (1e-5) / (nSi/nH)_sun. But since I don't have (nSi/nH)_sun, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2 without knowing the absolute values, just the ratio.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't have enough information about the Sun's [Si/H]. Hmm. Maybe I can make an assumption about the Sun's [Si/H], but that seems risky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the silicon abundance in each star in terms of hydrogen, using the given data, and then take the ratio.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe/nH = nFeH_sun = 3.16e-5.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But if I can express nSi in terms of nH, that would be helpful.

nSi (Star_1) = nH * (nSi/nH)_1.

Similarly, nFe (Star_1) = nH * (nFe/nH)_1 = nH * 3.16e-5.

From [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

So nSi = nFe * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But nFe = nH * 3.16e-5.

So nSi = (nH * 3.16e-5) * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Hmm, so (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSiH_sun) / (nFeH_sun) = (7.48e-5) / (3.16e-5) ≈ 2.367 as before.

Wait, so in that case, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(2.367) ≈ 0.373.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + 0.373 → 0.673 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.673 ≈ 4.68.

So nSi = nFe *4.68.

But nFe = 3.16e-5 *nH.

So nSi = 4.68 * 3.16e-5 * nH = approx 1.477e-4 *nH.

Wait, so nSi/nH for Star_1 is 1.477e-4.

Now, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → so nMg/nH = same as Sun → 1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 =0.3 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

So, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

But (nMg/nSi)_sun is (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Which is (1e-5) / (nSiH_sun). We have nSiH_sun ≈7.48e-5.

So (nMg/nSi)_sun = (1e-5)/(7.48e-5) ≈ 0.1336 → log(0.1336)= -0.875.

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(0.1336) ≈ -0.875.

Thus, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + (-0.875) = -0.575 → nMg/nSi = 10^(-0.575) ≈0.268.

So nMg = 0.268 *nSi.

But nMg is known: 1e-5 *nH.

So 1e-5 *nH = 0.268 *nSi → nSi = (1e-5 *nH) / 0.268 ≈ 3.73e-5 *nH.

So nSi/nH for Star_2 is approximately 3.73e-5.

Now, we want the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2: (nSi1/nH) / (nSi2/nH) = (1.477e-4) / (3.73e-5) ≈ 3.96.

So the ratio is approximately 4. So looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would be close to this value.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So for Star_1:

nSi = nFe * 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

nFe =3.16e-5 nH.

(nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSiH_sun / nFeH_sun) ≈7.48e-5/(3.16e-5)= approx 2.367.

So 10^0.3 is about 2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2? Wait, no, 10^0.3 is about 2? Wait, 10^0.3 is actually approximately 1.995, which is about 2.

So 2 * 2.367 ≈4.734. So nSi = 3.16e-5 *4.734 *nH.

3.16e-5 *4.734 ≈1.495e-4.

So nSi1/nH =1.495e-4.

For Star_2:

nMg =1e-5 *nH.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 =10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

nMg/nSi)_sun = (1e-5)/(7.48e-5) ≈0.1336.

10^0.3=2 → 2 *0.1336=0.2672.

So nMg =0.2672 *nSi → nSi =nMg /0.2672 = (1e-5 nH)/0.2672 ≈3.74e-5 nH.

So ratio is (1.495e-4)/(3.74e-5) ≈3.995, about 4. So option A is ~3.9, which is close.
