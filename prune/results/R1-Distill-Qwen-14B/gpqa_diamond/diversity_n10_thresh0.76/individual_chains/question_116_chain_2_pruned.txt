Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking down the information provided.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A. Let's go through each part systematically.

First, Compound A has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us the number of protons, and the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So, a triplet with 6H—could that be two sets of three equivalent protons each? Or maybe a group like two -CH2CH3 groups. Wait, because 6H is a lot. Maybe it's two -CH2CH3 groups, each contributing 3H, so 6H total. Or perhaps a cyclopropane or something else, but more likely ethyl groups.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—quartet usually indicates three neighboring protons, right? So if these are four protons, maybe they're on adjacent carbons to a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps a -CH2CH2- structure. Let's think of a molecule that has two ethyl groups. Maybe something like diethyl ether? But diethyl ether's structure is (CH2CH3)2O. Let me think about its NMR. The OCH2 would split into a quartet, but wait, diethyl ether's OCH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be triplet because they're next to CH2. So in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet and the OCH2 would be a quartet. But wait, in the problem, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, which is lower field than a typical CH2CH3. Wait, diethyl ether's CH2 is around 1.2 ppm, I think. Let me confirm: diethyl ether's NMR shows the CH3 as triplet at around 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 as quartet around 3.4 ppm. Wait, so that doesn't fit because in the problem, the quartet is at 1.3, which is more like a CH2 group next to another CH2. So maybe it's not diethyl ether.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Suppose we have a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Wait, another possibility is that the molecule is 2,2-dimethylbutane or something. But wait, 2,2-dimethylbutane would have a structure like (CH2CH(CH2CH3))... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, think of neopentane, but that's 2,2-dimethylpropane, which has a single NMR signal.

Another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that it's two equivalent -CH2CH3 groups. So, perhaps the molecule is something like ethyl something. Wait, if the molecule has two ethyl groups attached to the same carbon, like diethyl something. But then the quartet would be from the central CH2.

Wait, wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So the O is attached to two CH2CH3 groups. The OCH2 groups would each have neighboring CH3 groups. So the OCH2's protons would be split into a quartet because each is next to a CH2CH3 group. Wait, no. Wait, in diethyl ether, the O is connected to two CH2CH3 groups. So each OCH2 is connected to a CH2CH3. The OCH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as a triplet (since adjacent to OCH2). So for diethyl ether, the CH3 groups would be triplets around 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 groups would be quartets around 3.4 ppm. But in our problem, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, which is more like a CH2 next to another CH2, not an O-bearing CH2. So maybe it's not diethyl ether.

Alternatively, think about a structure where there are two ethyl groups attached to adjacent carbons in a ring. Wait, but if it's a cyclohexane with ethyl substituents, perhaps 1,2-diethylcyclohexane. Let me imagine the structure: cyclohexane with two ethyl groups on adjacent carbons. Then, each ethyl group's CH2 would be next to another CH2 (from the ring), leading to splitting. But in that case, the ethyl CH3 groups would be triplets because each is adjacent to a CH2. The two CH2 groups on the ring would each be next to two other CH2 groups, perhaps leading to more splitting, but I
