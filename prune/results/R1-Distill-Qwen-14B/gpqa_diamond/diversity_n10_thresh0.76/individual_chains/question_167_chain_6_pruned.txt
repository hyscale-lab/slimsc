Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

First, let me understand the problem. The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

The specific parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options given are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because Gaussian states (like coherent states, squeezed states) are easier to handle, but non-Gaussian states are necessary for certain quantum computing tasks. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is by comparing it to the closest Gaussian state.

But how do I compute this del_b? Let me break it down.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, its density matrix rho will be |psi><psi|.

Then, I need to find the reference Gaussian state tau. For a superposition of coherent states, the closest Gaussian state is typically a coherent state. Wait, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I've heard that the reference state could be the fully mixed state, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the relative entropy for non-Gaussianity would compare the given state to the Gaussian state that is closest to it. But I'm not entirely certain about this approach.

Wait, maybe another approach. The problem says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps tau is the Gaussian state which is the closest to rho. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state, but that depends on the context.

Alternatively, for a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the Gaussian state that is the closest might be a coherent state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the most similar Gaussian state, which could be another coherent state in the same space.

Wait, but I'm not very clear on this. Let me think about the structure.

The given state is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. The relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian state could measure how non-Gaussian it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that minimizes the relative entropy, making the del_b value the minimal possible. But regardless, for the problem, I might need to compute rho and tau, then calculate their von Neumann entropies and take the difference.

Wait, the relative
