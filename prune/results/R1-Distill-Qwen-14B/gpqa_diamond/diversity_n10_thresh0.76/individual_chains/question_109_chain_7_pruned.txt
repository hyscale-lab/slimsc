Okay, so I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted in this nuclear physics problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle tells us something about the quantum numbers of the final state.

Wait, the problem statement says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Oh right, I think T is the isospin, S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum of these plus 1 mod 2 equals the isospin of the NN system. 

The initial state is 1S0. Let me think about what that means. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 implies S=0 because 2*0+1=1. L is S, which is the orbital part; here, L=0 because it's an S state. J is the total angular momentum, which is 0 in this case.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0 (so orbital angular momentum is zero), and J=0. The parity of this state would be (-1)^L, so (-1)^0 = +1. So the initial parity is +1.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X. Let me denote the final state as the NN having certain quantum numbers, and X having some angular momentum state (like p, s, f, etc.), which is the orbital part of X's state.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So what does that tell me about the spin and orbital angular momentum? From the equation given: T = S + L +1 mod 2. So substituting T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So either S and L are both odd (so their sum is even, which doesn't fit) or one is even and the other odd. Wait, wait, no. Let me compute: 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ -1 ≡ 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd.

So, the NN in the final state must have S and L such that their sum is odd. Let's think about possible S and L combinations.

But wait, the NN system's total spin S can be 0 or 1, since two nucleons (each spin 1/2) can combine to S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). Similarly, the orbital angular momentum L can be 0,1,2,... but in the options, the emitted particles have specific l values.

The parity of the final NN state must also be considered. The parity is (-1)^L. Because when you emit a particle, the parity of the system changes based on the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, no. Let me think: when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum part is l, so the parity of the emitted state is (-1)^l. So the parity of the entire process must be conserved because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial parity is +1 (from 1S0). The emitted particle X has parity -1. So the parity of the final state (NN plus X) should be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X.

Wait no, I'm getting a bit tangled here. The total parity is the product of the initial parity, the parity of the emitted particle, and any change due to the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission. Hmm, maybe I should think about the parity conservation. 

The initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = (+1) because L_initial is 0. When the particle X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (denoted by lowercase letters like s, p, d, f) will contribute to the parity. So the parity of the emitted X is (-1)^l, where l is the orbital part of X's state. But the parity of the entire process must be conserved, but wait, parity is not necessarily conserved in weak interactions, but in strong and electromagnetic? Wait, in nuclear reactions, parity is conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but not in weak. Since this is an emission of a particle, perhaps it's via the strong force (like pion emission), so parity should be conserved.

Wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity must be conserved.
