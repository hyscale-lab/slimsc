Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is the Boltzmann constant.

Wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, actually the ratio of the excitation levels is 2:1 between the two stars.

Assuming that the transition is the same in both stars, so the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) might be the same for each star. Because it's the same element, same energy levels, so g_i/g_j is the same for both stars. So when I take the ratio between star_1 and star_2, that term cancels out.

So let's denote the ratio for star 1 as x1 and star 2 as x2. So x1 = 2 x x2. Or wait, the question says star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So maybe x1 = 2 x2. Because star_1's excitation is higher.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the excitation level (n_i/n_j) is twice that of star_2's. So n1 / n2 = 2. But wait, n1 is the ratio for star_1 and n2 for star_2. Oh no, wait: if star_1 has twice as excited, then (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

So, (n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2
