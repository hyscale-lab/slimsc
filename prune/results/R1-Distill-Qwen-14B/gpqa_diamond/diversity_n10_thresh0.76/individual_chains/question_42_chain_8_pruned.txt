Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16πσd²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, d is the distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem gives me the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, it's the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 T2. And then T2/T3 is 2.3, so T2 = 2.3 T3. So putting that together, T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3. Let me calculate that: 1.4 * 2.3 is approximately 3.22, so T1 ≈ 3.22 T3. So the equilibrium temperatures are T1, T2, and T3 with T3 being the smallest, then T2, then T1 being the largest.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (d), because T is proportional to (L(1-a))^(1/4) / (d^(1/2)). So T ∝ 1/√d. So higher T means closer to the star. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, so Planet1 must be closer to the star than Planet2. Similarly, Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, so Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So the order of distances is Planet3 > Planet2 > Planet1. Or wait, no, because the temperature is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), so if T1 is larger, d1 is smaller. Yeah, correct.

So T1 = 1.4 T2 → T1/T2 = 1.4 → (d2/d1)^(1/2) = 1.4 → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 ≈ 1.96. So d2 ≈ 1.96 d1. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3 → (d3/d2)^(1/2) = 2.3 → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 = ~5.29. So d3 ≈5.29 d2. So then d3 is much larger than d2, which is larger than d1.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, the period is related to the semi-major axis (distance) via Kepler's third law. Which is P² = (4π²/G M) ) a³, where M is the mass of the star. Wait, but in
