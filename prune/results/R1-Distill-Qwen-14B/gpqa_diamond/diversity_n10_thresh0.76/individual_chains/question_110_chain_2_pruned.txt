Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think through it step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like measuring stellar velocities and chemical compositions. The key here is their brightness limits. The question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17, but wait, no. Wait, no—because if one's limit is 17 and the other is 16, then the star must be brighter than both. Wait, no, wait—ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning it can go down to 17 or lower (brighter). Similarly, HIRES can go down to 16. So, a star with V mag less than or equal to 16 would be observable by both. Because, if a star is V=15, both can see it. But if a star is V=17, only ESPRESSO can see it. So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 mag to be observable by HIRES and also must be ≤17 mag to be observable by ESPRESSO. So, the more
