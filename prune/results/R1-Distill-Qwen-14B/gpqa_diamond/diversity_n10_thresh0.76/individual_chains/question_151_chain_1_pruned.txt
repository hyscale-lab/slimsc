Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to figure it out. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a given time t.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by matrices, and the state of the system is a vector. To find the probability of a particular outcome, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P and see which eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalue 0. Then, calculate the probability based on the state vector.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right, when you have an observable, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So I should first find the eigenvalues of matrix P. If 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the given state.

The state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). But wait, is this a column vector? The question says it's a column matrix, so yeah, it's a column vector. I think I need to normalize it first because probabilities depend on the state being normalized.

Right, the first step is to normalize the state vector. The state vector is Ïˆ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6.
