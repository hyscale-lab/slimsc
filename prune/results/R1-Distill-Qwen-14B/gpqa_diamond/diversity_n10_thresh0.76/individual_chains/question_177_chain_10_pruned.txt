Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read through it again.

So, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which I think relates to temperature via Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because if lambda is the same, T has to be the same because b is a constant.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity usually refers to the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight from the observer. But how does that affect the observed luminosity? Oh, I remember that when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the wavelengths. But wait, since the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, does that mean that they are at rest relative to each other, or that the Doppler shift is accounted for?

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed lambda_max is the same. But for Star_2, which is moving, if it's moving towards or away, the observed temperature would change. Hmm, but wait, the problem states that the star's temperature is the same because lambda_max is same, but if Star_2 is moving, maybe the observed lambda is shifted. So perhaps the given velocities are measured in the rest frame of the stars? Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe the radial velocities don't affect the calculation of the luminosity as per the black body formula because the problem is focused on the intrinsic properties. Or perhaps the velocities are given but not needed for luminosity calculation. The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation, so maybe the velocities don't directly affect the luminosity calculation because they're using the star's intrinsic properties.

Wait, but the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, if the stars have the same temperature (since their lambda_max is same), then L is proportional to R².

But wait, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, that ratio becomes (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor would be about 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but why are the velocities given then? Because the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Hmm. Does that affect the luminosity as observed?

Wait, no. Because when calculating the intrinsic luminosity (which is the actual energy output), the velocity doesn't matter. Because the star's luminosity is determined by its radius and temperature. The observed flux, which is what you'd measure, depends on distance and any Doppler effects, but luminosity is an intrinsic property.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. The radial velocity affects the observed flux because of Doppler shifting. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body. So perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed temperature, which would change the calculated luminosity.

Wait, let's think. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted. So the observed wavelength is shorter than the rest wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed lambda_max would be longer. But the problem says that both stars' lambda_max are the same. So even though Star_2 is moving, perhaps the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1.

So for Star_2, the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So the observed temperature would be same (since lambda_max is same). But the actual temperature of Star_2 might be different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, that complicates things. Let me think again.

Wien's Law: lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula is lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but for small velocities, it's approximately 1 + v_r/c. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then its observed lambda would be longer than its rest wavelength.

But according to the problem, both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So Star_1's lambda_rest is the same as Star_2's lambda_rest? No, no. Wait, let's see.

Wait, Star_1 has a rest lambda_max = b / T1. Star_2 has rest lambda_max = b / T2. But when Star_2 is moving, the observed lambda is lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c) ).

Given that lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs, because the problem says they are the same.

So, lambda1_rest = b / T1,

lambda2_rest = b /
