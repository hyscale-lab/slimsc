Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about the comoving distance of a quasar given certain observations and cosmological parameters.

First, the question states that the quasar has a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha forest and other absorption features can affect the observed spectrum of quasars. Oh, right! The Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, but due to redshift, it could shift into the optical or near-infrared. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that might be the redshifted Lyman-alpha line.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is typically at about 121.6 nm, right? So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's a redshift z. To calculate z, I can use the formula z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength - 1. So z = 790 / 121.6 - 1.

Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5 (because 120 * 6 is 720, 720 + 70=790, so 6.5). So 6.5 minus 1 is 5.5. So z is around 5.5.

Now, the question is about finding the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by the formula D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [dz' / E(z')], where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda), assuming a flat universe with matter density Ω_m and dark energy Ω_lambda.

Wait, the parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, which fits the standard Lambda-CDM model.

So, I need to compute the integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz', where E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7). Then multiply by c/H0 to get the comoving distance.

But wait
