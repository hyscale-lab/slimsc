Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So, an antiproton and a proton annihilating each other, producing two particles each of charge + and -. Interesting. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its speed is much less than the speed of light, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The mass of A times c squared is 300 MeV. And the question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so I need to find v in terms of c.

Hmm, first, I should remember that in particle reactions, energy and momentum are conserved. Since this is an annihilation, I think the initial momentum is just from the antiproton because the proton is at rest? No, wait. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving but slowly. So the initial total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton (since the proton has zero momentum). 

After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A−. But wait, the equation says 2A+ and 2A−. So that's four particles in total. Oh wait, no, wait: 2A+ and 2A− would be four particles, but the initial state is two particles (proton and antiproton). Hmm, but the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So four particles in the final state.

Wait, but for conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final state must equal the initial momentum. The initial momentum is the momentum of the incoming antiproton (since the proton is at rest). So the sum of all four particles' momenta in the final state must equal the initial antiproton's momentum.

But this seems complicated because now I have four particles each with possibly different momenta. How can I approach this?

Wait, maybe the particles are produced symmetrically. Since the reaction creates two A+ and two A−, perhaps they are moving in opposite directions, or maybe in pairs. Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ and two A− are moving in such a way that their
