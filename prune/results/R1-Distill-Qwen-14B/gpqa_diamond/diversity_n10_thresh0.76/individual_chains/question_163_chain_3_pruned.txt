Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so when it reacts with an acid, it should undergo a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt. The acid mentioned is monobasic and strong, so that's probably like HCl or HNO3, something that completely dissociates and donates one H+ per molecule.

The goal is to find two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 there is in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would help. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + (16*3) + (1*3) = 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Fe(OH)3: Fe is +3 charge, so each OH- is -1. So the formula is correct. So molar mass is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.0009358 mol. Let me note that as about 9.358e-4 mol.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong monobasic acid. The acid (like HCl) will donate H+ ions. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it will react with H+ to form Fe^3+ ions and water.

The reaction equation should be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base, so the reaction with H+ should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Yes, because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 will take a H+ to form water. Since there are three OH- groups, three H+ are needed per Fe(OH)3.

So stoichiometric ratio is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So for 9.358e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3, the required moles of H+ are 3 * 9.358e-4 = 0.0028074 mol.

But wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. So the concentration of H+ is 0.1 M (since the acid is 0.1 M and monobasic, so each mole of acid gives one mole of H+).

Wait, no. Wait, monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule. So a 0.1 M solution of the acid would have 0.1 M H+ because it's a strong acid and fully dissociates.

So the amount of H+ needed is 0.0028074 mol. Since the
