Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis.

The starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the starting molecule is a racemic mixture, does that affect the reaction? I think Grubbs catalyst is a chiral catalyst, but wait, noâ€”I think Grubbs is actually a homogeneous catalyst and not necessarily chiral. Oh wait, no, there are chiral versions, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe the racemic part is just about the starting material's configuration, but the reaction might proceed without creating or affecting the stereochemistry beyond that.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait, no. Let me structure this properly.

Actually, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So pent-1-ene is 1 double bond between 1 and 2.

So 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Let's see: The structure of
