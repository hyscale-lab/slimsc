Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, vectors in quantum mechanics are usually represented as column vectors, right? So I think this is a 3x1 column vector. The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). 

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the corresponding eigenvectors' coefficients when the state is expressed in that eigenbasis.

Wait, but wait a second. The observable is a matrix P, so I should probably find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But the matrix P is given, and I need to find the probability that the measurement yields 0. So perhaps 0 is an eigenvalue of P. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The expectation value of an observable is given by the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the state. But here, the question is specifically about the probability of measuring 0. So that would imply that 0 is an eigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenvector's projection squared is the probability.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state vector is a column vector [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me normalize it first because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized (i.e., their norm is 1).

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the state is normalized. So perhaps I should check that. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. So for the state vector Ïˆ = [-1, 2, 1]^T, the norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 +
