Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. X is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6, right? Wait, no, wait. Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li, lithium-6.

I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So the formula for kinetic energy might be different, but wait, the question just says energy, so I think it's the total energy, which is gamma times m c squared.

So first, I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me compute that.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)).

Plugging in v = 0.96c, so v^2/(c^2) = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is, let's see. 0.28^2 is 0.0784? Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. Yeah, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286. Hmm, wait, let me compute this more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

Okay, so gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the lithium-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m c². What's the mass of ^6Li?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on exact masses. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy, but maybe I can approximate it as roughly the mass number times the mass of a proton.

Wait, no, because neutrons also have mass, but each is slightly heavier than protons. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of ^6Li. Oh wait, this is a problem, I can't look it up right now. So maybe I should recall the approximate value.

Wait, I think the mass of a proton is about 938 Me
