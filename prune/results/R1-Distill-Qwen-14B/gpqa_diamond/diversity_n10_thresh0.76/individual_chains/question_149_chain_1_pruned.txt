Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. They're looking at the 1H NMR and LC-MS data. Let's see what each part says.

First, the 1H NMR spectrum. The peaks look consistent except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. So, same proton but two peaks. They have similar chemical shifts and the integrals add up to 1H. So, maybe they are split into two for some reason, but not due to spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. So, not J-coupling with neighboring protons.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So, same mass, but two separate peaks on the chromatogram.

Hmm. So possible explanations. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a peptide bond forms, so the precursor would be the unreacted starting material, which would have a higher mass. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They would have the same molecular weight, so same mass. In NMR, enantiomers would show the same spectrum because the environments are symmetrical. Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Hmm, wait, no. If it's a racemic mixture, the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton, because each enantiomer's NMR would look the same. Wait, but maybe in the case of a diastereotopic situation, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same alpha proton, but maybe because of some other reason.

Wait, the alpha protons in a peptide are typically in a chiral environment. So if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the alpha proton in each enantiomer would experience the same environment, so you'd see a single peak. Because the two enanti
