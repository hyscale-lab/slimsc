Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that these abundance ratios can tell us a lot about the star's history, like if they were part of a supernova or something. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact calculations. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass matters for calculating the silicon ratio. Maybe it's just extra info.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method with LTE assumed. The values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, [X/Y] notation is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, I think it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun's.

The solar photosphere values are provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I guess I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Wait, but the question is about the ratio, so it's (n_Si in Star_1) divided by (n_Si in Star_2).

Let me think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1:
We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, let's clarify. The [X/Y] notation is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So if [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, then (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I need to find n_S
