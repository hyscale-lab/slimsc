Okay, so I need to find the pH of this solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me three different solutions mixed together: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Right, so I should probably figure out the moles of each acid and base first.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll calculate the moles for each component. 

Starting with acetic acid (CH3COOH). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters, and the concentration is 0.1 M. Moles = concentration × volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but I'll deal with that later.

Next is HCl. The volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L, and concentration is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L, and concentration is 0.3 M. So moles are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2, right? So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH- ions.

Now, I need to see what happens when these are mixed. The H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. Because HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, their reaction will produce water and salt. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, let's figure out how much H+ and OH- we have. HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-. So the OH- is in excess. How much excess?

The neutralization would be: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Wait, but what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ ions, but since we have excess OH-, the OH- will react with any available H+ from CH3COOH as well. So the OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So, how much OH- is left after reacting with all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH? Let me think. The initial moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08, and from CH3COOH, it's 0.05 (since it's a weak acid, but I think in this case, since it's being neutralized, the moles of H+ available for reaction would be the same as the moles of CH3COOH, assuming it's a 1:1 reaction). So the total H+ available is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 moles.

OH- available is 0.18 moles. So the OH- will neutralize 0.13 moles of H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH), leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, that's a different approach. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reevaluate.

HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into H+ and Cl-. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it fully dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So the H+ from HCl will react with OH-, but there's more OH- than H+.

So, after HCl's H+ is neutralized, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- left.

But wait, ac
