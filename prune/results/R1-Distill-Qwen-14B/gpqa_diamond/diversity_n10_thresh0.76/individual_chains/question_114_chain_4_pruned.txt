Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B in the presence of H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think the first reaction is an addition of a nitrile group to a ketone. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide in a specific condition, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, isn't that usually under acidic conditions? Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but in a ketone, which is not very acidic, so maybe we need to protonate the carbonyl to make it more electrophilic.

So when a ketone reacts with HCN or NaCN, under certain conditions, it adds the nitrile group. Oh wait, but wait, NaCN in a protic acid, like H3O+? Because the first step would be protonation of the carbonyl oxygen. So butan-2-one plus H+ (from H3O+) would make it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack, adding across the carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin.

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be CH2(C)(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Butanenitrile would have four carbons. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, so the structure is (CH(CH3)(OH))CN-CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I should write it as (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, but wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with four carbons. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on carbon 4, and hydroxyl on carbon 2, which is also methyl-substituted.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that would be 3-hydroxy. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentanenitrile, no. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But butanenitrile has four carbons. Wait, butan-2-one is a three-carbon ketone: (CH3)2CO. So when you add HCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Because the main chain is four carbons: the nitrile is on C-4, the hydroxyl on C-2.

So the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN and H3O+ (acid) as reagents. Because the mechanism requires acid catalysis. So reagent A is H3O+.

Wait, but in the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So option A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3 as A.

So for the first reaction, the right reagent A is H3O+. So options A, B, or C,D can be considered.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B in H2O to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, the typical reagent is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) with heat, or sometimes using a catalyst like HgSO4. Alternatively, under basic conditions, like with H2O and heat, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, let's think. Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in two ways: under acidic conditions, it gives a carboxylic acid, but I think under strong acidic conditions, maybe with H2SO4 and H2O, heating, you get the acid. But sometimes, nitriles are hydrolyzed under basic conditions, like with NaOH and H2O, heating, to form a sodium carboxylate, which is then acidified to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B in H2O. The
