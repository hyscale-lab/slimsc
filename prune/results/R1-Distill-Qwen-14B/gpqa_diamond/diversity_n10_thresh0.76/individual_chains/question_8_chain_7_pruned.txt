Okay, so I have this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants, and double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each mutant and double mutant. The control is 100% resistance. So the mutants have varying levels.

The key points from the results are:

g1: 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely susceptible.

g2: 0%. So no resistance at all. That's interesting. Maybe this gene is critical.

g3: 50%. Half resistance.

Double mutants:

g1g3: 10% – very low.

g2g3: 0% – same as g2.

g1g2: 0% – same as g2.

Wait, so what's the pattern here. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. Similarly, when G2 is knocked out in combination with G1 or G3, it's 0%. So that suggests that G2 is somehow upstream or essential for the resistance. Because even if you have G1 or G3 not working, the presence of G2's knockout takes resistance to zero.

Now, let's think about the options. The question says at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So probably G2 is that transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D. Let's see:

Option A says G1 is a TF. But our data seems to suggest G2 is the TF since g2 has 0% and the others have some. So perhaps A is wrong.

Option B says G2 is the TF. That makes sense. Then it says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Hmm, same promoter might mean they are part of the same operon, but that's more in prokaryotes. Not sure about that. Also, it says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if G3 is epistatic, then G3's phenotype would mask G1's. But in the g1g3 double mutant, resistance is 10% which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). Hmm, maybe not. Because if G3 is epistatic, perhaps when both are knocked out, effect would be additive or something else.

Option C says G2 is the TF. Then G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that fits here. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in a double mutant, the effect would be the same as the epistatic gene. For example, if G1 is epistatic, then the g1g3 double mutant would be like g1, which is 75%. But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is lower. So maybe not that.

Option D says G2 is the TF. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy means that they can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either single. In this case, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75, g3 is 50). So that fits. Then, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the phenotype of the double mutant would be determined by G1. Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either. So if G1 is epistatic, maybe the double mutant would be as bad as the worse single mutant, which is g3 at 50%? But here, it's even worse. Hmm, maybe this isn't matching.

Wait, let me think again. Epistasis is about which gene is upstream. The gene that is upstream (like a TF) would be epistatic to the downstream genes. So if G2 is a TF, then any downstream genes (like G1 or G3) would have their effects masked when G2 is knocked out.

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

- g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

- g1g3: 10% → which is lower than either of their single mutants. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, resistance is worse than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant. If both are knocked out, their combined function is worse than either, so the resistance is lower.

So what's the conclusion?

G2 is a transcription factor (since when it's knocked out, all double mutants with it are 0). So in the options, options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Not sure about that, but the data doesn't directly support that.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I don't think so; pleiotropy is about affecting multiple traits, not necessarily about their effect when both are mutated.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That seems to fit, because when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So knocking out both has a worse effect than knocking out either one.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF. G1 and G3 are redundant (they can compensate for each other, so when both are out, the effect is additive or worse). Also, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 because when G2 is knocked out, the double mutants have the same phenotype as g2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF → unlikely, since g2 is 0.

Option B: G2 is TF. Then G1 and G3 have same promoter (maybe), but the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than any single. So redundancy makes sense. Also, G3 is epistatic over G1. Wait, but if G3 is epistatic, then in a double mutant, we'd see the effect of G3. But in g1g3, the effect is 10%, which is worse than both. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another way: epistatic genes are those that when mutated, mask the effect of other mutations in the pathway. So if G2 is a TF upstream of G1 and G3, then mutating G2 would mask the effects of G1 and G3. Which fits with the data, since g1g2 and g2g3 and g1g2 all have 0% resistance.

So which option says that? Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, and G1 is ep
