Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements are a bit tricky for me. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C, and I need to match them with the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible structures for these products.

First, let's look at each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A**

Hmm, I remember that when certain amines and alcohols are heated with acid, they can undergo rearrangement. Since the question mentions sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic, maybe this is a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. But wait, those typically involve 1,5-dienes or similar systems. Alternatively, perhaps this is an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The amine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. The alcohol is but-3-en-2-ol, which is a secondary alcohol with a double bond adjacent.

When these two react under acidic and heated conditions, I think they form a cyclic intermediate. Maybe it's a hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, because one is an amine and the other an alcohol. Oh! Maybe they form a cyclic hemiaminal. Because under acidic conditions, the alcohol can protonate and form a good leaving group. The amine would attack the carbocation-like center?

Wait, another thought: the combination of an amine and an alcohol under acid and heat might lead to a rearrangement via a cyclic transition state. Specifically, I remember that the Claisen rearrangement involves an enol ether rearranging, but this setup is different. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Mannich-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift. If the amine and alcohol combine to form a conjugated diene system. Let me think about the structures.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be like (CH3O)2CHNH2. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2=C(H)CH2OH. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2OH where the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, wait but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the four-carbon chain. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if the chain is numbered 1 to 4), but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but that would
