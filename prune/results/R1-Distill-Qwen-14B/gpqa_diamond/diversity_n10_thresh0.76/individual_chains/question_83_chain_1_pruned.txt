Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 plus 20 is 40.

Let me calculate the concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume, so 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Diluting it to 0.04 L (40 cm³), the new concentration is moles/volume, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point will be when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. Wait, but wait, the initial volumes were 40 cm³ of acetic acid solution. When we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³. Hmm, but maybe I don't need that right now.

The first part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So we're adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Let me think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, the moles remaining are 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when we add the NaOH, the total volume increases. The
