Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about comparing the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment with the classical approximation. I remember that in classical mechanics, things are simpler, but when dealing with high speeds or high energies, relativistic effects come into play.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So I think the initial mass M is being converted into two smaller masses, but some energy is released as binding energy, maybe?

Wait, let me get the given data straight.

M_initial = M. Its rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c², but since we're dealing in terms of mass, maybe we can ignore c² for now because it's a proportionality factor.

After fission, two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Let's call the less massive one m. Then the more massive is 2m. So total mass after is m + 2m = 3m. But the sum of their rest masses is 0.99M.

So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.33M and 0.66M.

Wait, wait, no. Because 3m is 0.99M, so m is 0.33M. So fragment A is 0.33M, fragment B is 0.66M.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest. So the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies will depend on their masses and velocities.

But wait, the problem is about calculating the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and comparing it with the classical approximation. So we need to find the difference between T1 (relativistic) and T1_classical.

I think the approach is to first find the velocities of the two fragments using conservation of energy and momentum. Then calculate the kinetic energy in both relativistic and classical ways, subtract the two for the difference.

But let's outline the steps.

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.

Given that M splits into two, with one twice the other in rest mass. Sum of their masses is 99% of M.

So, fragment 1: m1 = 2m2.

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting, 2m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M.

So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

2. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum before is zero. So the momentum after must be zero.

So, p1 = p2, but opposite in direction. Since momentum is m*v, but relativistically, it's gamma*m*v. Wait, but for momentum conservation, the total must be zero. So, relativistic momentum of both fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p1 = -p2.

So, gamma1 * m1 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * v2.

But since the nucleus is at rest, the only energy comes from the rest mass. So the total energy before is Mc², and after is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the mass after is less than the initial, so some energy is released as kinetic energy, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so initially,
