Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait, I think "excited" here refers to the excitation state, so the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one. So maybe it's about the ratio of atoms in a particular energy level.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation here, right? The Boltzmann distribution relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations, N_upper/N_lower, equals (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that means the population ratio N1_upper/N1_lower is twice that of N2_upper/N2_lower. Or maybe N_upper for star 1 is twice that of star 2. Wait, but wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Oh, perhaps it's the number of atoms in the excited state relative to the ground state, so N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2's. So N1/N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower). Or maybe not; I need to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that the number in the excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Hmm, not sure. Let's think again.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So I think it refers to the ratio of excited atoms to unexcited in each star. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no, actually, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". Wait, perhaps that the population of the specific energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or maybe the excitation is higher, so the ratio N_upper/N_lower is higher.

Wait, perhaps it's that the excitation is higher in star_1, so the fraction in the excited state is higher. So N1_upper/N1_lower = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower). Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited as star_2's.

So using the Boltzmann equation, for each star, we can write:

N1_upper / N1_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
Similarly,
N2_upper / N2_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But
