Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. The process given is γγ → e+ e-. So, high-energy gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs.

I remember that the lifetime of a particle is the time it takes for it to decay or annihilate. So, for a gamma-ray photon, if it's annihilating with CMB photons, the lifetime would depend on the probability of that interaction happening.

The CMB has an average photon energy of 10^-3 eV. So each CMB photon isn't very high energy, but there's a lot of them because the universe is filled with them.

Wait, the gamma-ray is high energy, so its wavelength is very short. The CMB photons are low energy but they're everywhere. So the gamma-ray photon is moving through a bath of these low-energy photons.

The process is pair production via two-photon collisions. But wait, in this case, the gamma-ray and a CMB photon annihilate. So the gamma-ray is one photon, and the CMB photon is the other. So this is a two-photon collision creating an electron-positron pair.

I think the probability of this happening depends on the cross-section for the reaction. The cross-section σ would determine how likely the interaction is. The higher the cross-section, the more probable the annihilation, so the shorter the lifetime.

But the cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the photons involved. I remember that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- increases with the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for electron-positron pair production is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron, which is about 1.02 MeV. But since we're dealing with high-energy gamma-rays, the energy is way above that, so the process is possible.

But wait, the actual cross-section is a function of the photon energies. For high-energy photons, the cross-section can be approximated using some formula. I think the cross-section σ for this process scales with the square of the
