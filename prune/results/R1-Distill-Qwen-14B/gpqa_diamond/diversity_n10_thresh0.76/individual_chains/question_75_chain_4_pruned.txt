Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein and SARS-CoV-2. The main issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, but the expression isn't working. The problem is probably in the construct's sequence they provided.

So, looking at the plus strand sequence they provided, I need to analyze it for any issues that would prevent proper expression. Let's think about possible things that could go wrong.

First, when you add a tag like HA to the N-terminus, it's usually added at the beginning of the coding sequence. So the start codon should come after the tag. Wait, let me check the beginning of the sequence. The sequence starts with "ATG", which is the start codon. So the HA tag would be right after that. But wait, in the construct, the HA tag is part of the coding sequence for the protein. The HA tag's coding sequence is added before the GADD45G sequence, so the ATG should be the start of the HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G.

But wait, the question says they introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence, followed by GADD45G. So the first few codons would be the HA tag.

Looking at the given sequence, does it include the HA tag correctly? Let me think: the HA tag is a short peptide, usually around 11 amino acids. The coding sequence for HA is something like ATG TAC CAC ATC GAT, but maybe I should check the exact sequence.

Wait, the construct's sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, then CCATACGATGTT. Hmm, maybe I should look for the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA epitope is YVHHHHHHYPRYPYD, but the DNA coding for that would be a specific sequence. Alternatively, the construct adds the HA tag before the
