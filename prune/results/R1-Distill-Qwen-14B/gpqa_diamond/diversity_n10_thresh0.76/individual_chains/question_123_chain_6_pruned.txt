Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's break it down.

The question says that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so that means the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the galaxy, right? Because in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at that speed.

The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, time dilation comes into play here because of the high speed. So I can't just multiply speed by time directly without considering the time difference between the two frames.

I remember that time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is t' = gamma * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame and t' is the time in the ejecta's frame. Wait, actually, I think the formula is t = gamma * t', because the moving clock runs slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t'), how much time passes in the galaxy's frame (t)?

Wait, no, actually, the time in the galaxy's frame (t) would be longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t'). So t = gamma * t'. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - vÂ²
