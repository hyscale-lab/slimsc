Okay, so I have this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB has a certain energy, and gamma-rays interacting with it can produce electron-positron pairs. The question is about determining the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. 

Wait, the process is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. So the gamma-ray (high energy) collides with a CMB photon, and they annihilate into an electron-positron pair. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

I think this has to do with the interaction rate and the mean free path. When a gamma-ray travels, it can annihilate with CMB photons. The lifetime being limited means that the gamma-ray doesn't travel too far before annihilating, so we're looking for the energy where the mean lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe or something like that. 

The formula for the cross-section for this process might be important. I recall that the cross-section for gamma-gamma to e+ e- is proportional to (s) where s is the square of the center of mass energy. Wait, isn't the cross-section sigma proportional to (s) over some threshold? Or maybe it's a function of the energy.

Wait, the general approach for such problems is to calculate the optical depth. The optical depth is the product of the cross-section, the number density of the target photons (CMB), and the distance the gamma-ray travels. If the optical depth is about 1, then the process is significant, meaning that the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited because it interacts within a certain distance.

So the optical depth tau equals n_photon * sigma * L, where L is the length. The gamma-ray's lifetime is limited when tau is about 1. So tau ≈ 1.

The cross-section for gamma gamma -> e+ e- is given by the formula sigma = (8π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (1/(4π)) * (1/(v^2)) ) * ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for pair production (gamma + photon -> e+ e-) is sigma ≈ 6π/(m_e^2) * (E_cm²)/(E1 E2), or something like that. 

Wait, the cross-section formula for two photons annihilating into an electron-positron pair is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula or the more general formula for pair production. Alternatively, since both are photons, perhaps the cross-section is sigma = (8π/3) * (α²/m_e²) * (1/(4)) ... Hmm, I'm not too sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, the threshold condition for pair production is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass. So the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) must be >= 2 m_e c². 

So sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) ), but since photons are massless, their energy is |p| c. So s = (
