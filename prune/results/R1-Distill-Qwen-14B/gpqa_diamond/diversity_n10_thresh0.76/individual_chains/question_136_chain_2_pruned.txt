Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of f, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, divergence. Oh right, divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. And Gauss's Law comes into play here, I think. Because the divergence theorem relates the flux through a surface to the divergence in the volume.

So the integral of ∇·f over the volume of the sphere is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere, according to the divergence theorem. That makes sense because the divergence theorem connects volume integrals to surface fluxes.

But wait, what's the flux of f through the surface? The flux Φ is the integral of f · dA over the surface. Since f is only radial and the surface is a sphere, the dot product simplifies because dA is also radial. So f · dA is just f(r) multiplied by the area element dA.

The sphere has a radius of R, so the area element dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ. But when we integrate over the entire sphere, the integral of sinθ dθ dφ from 0 to π and 0 to 2π gives the surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².

Wait, but what's f at the surface? Since f(r) = 1/r² and r is R here, f(R) is 1/R². So the flux Φ would be f(R) multiplied by the surface area. So Φ = (1/R²) * 4πR² = 4π.

So the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π. Looking at the options, option A is 4π. But wait, is there any chance I'm missing a negative sign or something?

Wait, no, because if the field is pointing radially outward, the divergence should be positive. Because the flux is escaping the volume, so the divergence inside would be positive. Alternatively, if the field were pointing inward, divergence would be negative, but here it's radially outward.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The divergence of a radial vector field in spherical coordinates is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component. Since f(r) is 1/r², f_r = 1/r².

So, let's compute ∇·f. In spherical coordinates, for a vector field with only a radial component F_r:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r)

So substituting F_r = 1/r²:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²) * 0 = 0

Oh wait, that's zero. So wait, that would mean that the integral of the divergence over the volume is zero. But that contradicts what I thought earlier when applying the divergence theorem.

Wait, that can't be right. Because according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. But I calculated the flux as 4π.

Hmm, there's a contradiction here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the divergence calculation. Let me re-derive that.

The divergence for a radial vector field F(r) = F_r r̂. The formula is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r)

So F_r is 1/r². So substituting:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) =
