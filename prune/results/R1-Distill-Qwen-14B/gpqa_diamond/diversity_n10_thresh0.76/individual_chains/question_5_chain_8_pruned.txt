Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the first thing I need to do is understand what the operator P looks like when it's expressed in the direction n. 

Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, that means it can be represented with angles θ and φ. Oh wait, but I'm not sure about φ. Oh, wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle from the x-axis. But since n is in the x-z plane, that means the direction is such that the y-component is zero. So φ would be zero or π, but maybe that's not important right now.

The operator P, which acts on spin-1/2 particles like a muon, should be the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. The general form for a spin operator along an arbitrary direction n is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ are the Pauli matrices. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P simplifies to (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

Wait, the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |v> such that P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>. 

Let me write down the components. The given matrices are:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

But for the operator along n, which is in x-z plane, the operator P is a combination of P_x and P_z. Let's denote the direction vector as n = (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So, the operator P is (ħ/2)( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ). Wait, but what are nx and nz? Since it's a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1.

Wait, but the given problem doesn't specify the exact direction of n. So perhaps the eigenvector can be expressed in terms of angles θ and φ, but since n is in x-z, φ is zero. So perhaps I can express the operator P in terms of θ, because for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of the spin component in direction n have their eigenvectors expressible in terms of θ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that for any direction, the eigenstate can be written as a general spin-up or down
