Alright, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and must respect certain symmetries. 

Lorentz symmetry—right, effective theories must respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators should also respect it. Otherwise, they wouldn't make sense in the relativistic framework of the SM. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is a must.

Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz and translational symmetries. Wait, but in the effective theory, do the operators have to respect Poincaré? Well, Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincaré. If the theory is relativistic, Poincaré should be respected. But wait, in SMEFT, operators are classified by their Lorentz indices, which implies Lorentz symmetry is already a given. But what about translations? I think that's part of the foundation of the theory, so operators would have to respect that too. So Poincaré symmetry (option 2) is also a must. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if all operators automatically respect this. Or maybe the question is more about which symmetries are required beyond the SM's usual symmetries.

Wait, the question says "must be respected by all operators." So in SMEFT, you can have operators that break some SM symmetries, like flavor or gauge symmetries. But certain symmetries are more fundamental, like Lorentz, Poincaré, and perhaps others.

Wait, wait another thing. The SM includes Poincaré symmetry, so any effective theory derived from it must respect that as well. So SMEFT operators must be Poincaré-invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are required. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

Now, what about the other options, CP and CPT? I'm a bit confused. The Standard Model respects CP symmetry, except for certain sectors like the CKM matrix where CP violation occurs. But in SMEFT, operators can include terms that violate CP, right? Because you can have higher-dimensional operators that explicitly break CP. So if the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators, then CP might not be a required symmetry. Because some operators might not preserve it.

Wait, but wait. The SM's interactions, including the effective ones, can violate CP, but are the SMEFT operators allowed to do so? Or is CP a symmetry that needs to be preserved? I think that in SMEFT, the operators can break CP because you can have terms that are odd under CP. So not all operators have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM is CPT symmetric. I think that any renormalizable theory that respects Poincaré symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry because of the spin-statistics theorem and other fundamental reasons. But effective theories can have issues with CPT. Wait, but SMEFT is a valid effective theory, so perhaps it must respect CPT. Or maybe the question is about which symmetries must be respected regardless of the interactions.

Wait, I think that CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including effective ones. Because CPT symmetry arises from the requirement that the theory is unitary and respects causality and relativistic principles. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

Wait, but could the SMEFT have operators that break CPT? Because I remember that in some cases, certain higher-dimensional operators can break CPT. But wait, in SMEFT, I think the operators are constructed in a way that they are invariant under CPT. Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense—it would lead to non-unitary or other inconsistencies.

Alternatively, maybe SMEFT does allow for CPT violation. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Standard Model, being a renormalizable theory, respects CPT. But effective theories can have terms that break certain symmetries, but CPT is a deeper symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So which symmetries are automatically satisfied because of the way SMEFT is constructed.

In SMEFT, operators are built as Lorentz-invariant and gauge-invariant (for the SM gauge group). So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Since Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation symmetries, and since the SM respects these, SMEFT operators must also be Poincaré invariant. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry: SMEFT can have operators that break CP. For example, operators that involve terms that are not CP even. So not all operators must respect CP. So option 3 is not correct.

CPT symmetry: I'm not entirely sure. The SM respects CPT, and I think that SMEFT must as well because it's an effective theory built upon the SM. If the SM respects CPT, then any effective theory derived from it should too. Because if there were a CPT violation in the SMEFT, it would imply a violation in the underlying theory, which isn't the case.

Wait, but wait. I think that the Standard Model is CPT symmetric, and since SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, it must also be CPT symmetric. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it all together: which options are correct? The question is asking which must be respected by all operators. So which of the four symmetries are required.

So, the correct symmetries would be Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. So that's the answer. Wait, no, option C is 1,2,4. But I thought earlier about Poincaré and Lorentz. Are they considered separate? Or is Poincaré a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz?

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is a part of Poincaré symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincaré, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question says whether the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincaré, then perhaps Poincaré is the more inclusive symmetry.

But the way the question is phrased, it's whether each symmetry is individually respected. So perhaps the correct answer includes Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.

Wait, but in the given options, option C is 1,2,4, which would be Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT. So that's the correct set. So the answer would be C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an effective field theory derived from the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT maintains the relativistic framework of the SM, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, and SMEFT is built upon the SM, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM respects CP symmetry in most sectors, but higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can explicitly break CP. Since not all operators in SMEFT are required to respect CP symmetry, this symmetry is not universally enforced.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct combination is given in **Option C**.

Answer: C
