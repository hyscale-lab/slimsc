Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about the decay probability of a single atom. The setup is that the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, so the probability depends on the time and the decay constant.

Wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means there's a 32% chance the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, it's still not decayed. I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, is that 150 minutes from the start or from the current time? Oh, right, it's 150 minutes from now, so that's 200 minutes total since the start because 50 + 150 is 200. Or wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, so we're looking for the decay probability in the next 150 minutes from this point. So the total time from start is 50+150=200 minutes. But maybe I should approach this using the exponential decay formula.

The decay probability can be modeled by the equation P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. But wait, I know that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Solving for λ.

Let me rearrange that. So e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, I know ln(1)=0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5. Let me think, ln(0.68)= ln(1-0.32) ≈ -0.38566 (using calculator in my mind). So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since we've already waited 50 minutes without decay, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So the probability would be P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the probability of decay in the next t minutes given that it hasn't decayed yet is the same as the probability
