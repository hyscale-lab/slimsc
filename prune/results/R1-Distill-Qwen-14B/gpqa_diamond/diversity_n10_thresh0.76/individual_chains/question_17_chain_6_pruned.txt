Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which I guess means we don't have to worry about hydrolysis or anything complicating the EDTA. The temperature is 25°C, which is probably standard conditions, so maybe some constants are given or assumed. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I think K here refers to the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion from its constituent ions. So for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So that means the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA^4- is 1:1. Because in the complex, each Ca²+ binds one EDTA molecule. So in the solution, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be equal?

Wait, but if it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA
