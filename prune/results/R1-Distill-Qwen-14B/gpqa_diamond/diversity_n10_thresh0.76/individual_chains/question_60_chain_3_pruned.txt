Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: An alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has a spacecraft that's super fast, moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we're supposed to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are like, will they die before getting here or not, or how old they'll be when they arrive.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation in special relativity. From the perspective of someone on the spacecraft, time moves slower compared to someone stationary relative to them. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the moving clock (spaceship) would experience less time. Because of gamma, the Lorentz factor, right?

So, gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Since v is super close to c here, the gamma factor must be really large. But from the perspective of the astronaut, the distance to Earth would be contracted, so the trip would take less time than it would from Earth's frame.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Time dilation affects how much time the astronaut experiences versus someone on Earth. So from Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving fast, so the astronaut ages less. But from the astronaut's frame, the Earth is moving towards them, so the distance is shorter, so the time taken is less.

So first, I need to figure out how much distance the spaceship has to cover. Wait, wait, the problem says it's from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. How far is that? I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let's say approximately 170,000 light-years. But wait, wait, the exact distance might not be crucial because we're looking at time from the astronaut's perspective, which involves length contraction.

So, in the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted. The contraction factor is 1/gamma. So the proper length (from Earth's frame) is L0 = 170,000 light-years. The length observed on the spaceship is L = L0 / gamma.

Wait, but
