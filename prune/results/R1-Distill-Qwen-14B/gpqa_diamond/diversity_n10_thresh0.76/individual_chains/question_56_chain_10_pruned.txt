Okay, so I've got this physics problem about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, what do I remember about dipole transitions? Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. The key ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So when an electron undergoes a dipole transition, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>, so n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. So, two dipole transitions are involved because going from 3 to 1 in n would require two steps. Let me see, maybe 3 → 2 → 1.

But wait, each transition must follow the selection rules. So from n=3, l=0, m=0, what states can it transition to?

For the first transition (3,0,0) → (something). The selection rule for l: since l starts at 0, it can only go to l=1 (because Δl=±1, but from 0 you can't go to -1, so only +1). So the next state after transition must have l=1.

So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So possible states would have n=2 (since n has to decrease by 1 in each step, I think, because each photon emission usually changes n by 1). Wait, no, n can change by more than 1, but in dipole transitions, I think Δn can be ±1. So from n=3, you can go to n=2 or 4? But in this case, the next state is going to be lower since it's emission, so n=2.

So the first transition is 3,0,0 → 2,1, something. The m can change by 0, ±1. Since initial m is 0, the possible m's after are -1, 0, +1.

So the possible states after the first transition are |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.

Then, from each of those, what's the next transition to reach |1,0,0>?

Wait, the final state is l=0, so from the first transition state (l=1), the next transition must have Δl=-1, so l=0. So each step must follow the rules.

So let's see each possibility:

1. If the first transition is to |2,1,0>, then from here, the next transition would need to go to n=1, l=0, m=0. So that's possible because Δl = -1 (from 1 to 0), and m changes by
