Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. So, the coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the two-electron system.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. Specifically, what's the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ?

Hmm, okay. I remember that for angular momentum, the z-component eigenvalues are given by L_z |...> = mħ |...>. So for each electron, the possible m values would be -l, ..., +l. Since each is in a p orbital, l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1 for each.

But wait, the coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its m is -1.

Wait, but for two particles, the total angular momentum is the sum of their individual angular momenta. So each individual can have l₁ and l₂, which are 1 and 1 here.

I think the state |l₁,l₂,l,m> is a coupled state, which is a combination of all possible ways to add l₁ and l₂ to get l. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The problem asks about the probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ. So, each would have a m value of -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are mħ, so m=-1 would give -ħ.

Wait, but the total m is given as -1. So if each electron has m₁ and m₂, then m = m₁ + m₂. So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. That means that m₁ + m₂ = -1.

But the question is, what's the probability that both m₁ and m₂
