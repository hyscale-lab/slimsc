Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions labeled i to ix.

Hmm, I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order in which substituents are introduced matters because of directing effects. Benzene is initially activated towards electrophilic substitution, but once substituents are added, they direct incoming groups to certain positions.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me sketch this structure mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, actually, numbering the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. That's a meta arrangement relative to each other but in a way that each is adjacent.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's fix the ethoxy group at position 1. Then, the tert-butyl is at position 2 (ortho), and nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy). Or wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, and numbering can be tricky. Let me think again: the target has 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So, from the ethoxy group at position 1, moving clockwise, the next position is 2 (tert-butyl), then 3 (nitro). So, they are all in adjacent positions, but each substituent is in a different position.

Wait, the positions are 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. So, ethoxy (OEt) at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are
