Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about isomers, tautomerism, and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. I need to find out the answers for both and see which option matches.

Starting with part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two adjacent atoms, leading to different isomers. Like in ketones and aldehydes, but wait, does it apply here?

Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone. Quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Oh wait, but benzoquinone has two ketone groups at the para positions. I remember that when a molecule has two ketone groups in conjugation, like in 1,4-benzoquinone, it can't tautomerize because the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl is already in a position where it can't shift. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think: Tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, if you have a diketone where the two carbonyls are next to each other, maybe tautomerism is possible. But in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are opposite each other, so the hydrogen isn't adjacent to both. So maybe benzoquinone can't tautomerize because the hydrogen isn't in the right position. Or wait, maybe I'm wrong. Another thought: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups at 1,3,5 positions. But wait, that's a six-membered ring with three carbonyls. Each carbonyl is adjacent to another. So for tautomerism, the hydrogen would have to be next to a carbonyl. Let me visualize the structure: each of the three carbonyls is separated by a CH2 group. So, each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Wait, in 1,3,5-trione, each oxygen is at positions 1,3,5 on the cyclohexane ring. So each of those positions has a carbonyl. Then, the adjacent carbons (like 2,4,6) have CH2 groups. So those carbons have two adjacent carbonyls. Wait, if a CH2 is flanked by two carbonyls, can it undergo tautomerism? Because each of those CH2 groups is next to two ketones. So, perhaps the structure allows for keto-enol tautomerism because the hydrogen can shift from one carbon to another. Like in a diketone, you can have enol formation because the hydrogen is between two carbonyls.

But wait, in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are opposite each other. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O, but that's not exactly right. Benzoquinone is like a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. So for each of those, the adjacent carbons are each single-bonded to a benzene ring. So adjacent to each ketone group, the carbons are connected to the ring, not another carbonyl. So, in that case, can the molecule undergo tautomerism? Well, each ketone is in a position where the adjacent carbon is only attached to one ketone, not two. So maybe the molecule can't form an enol because it doesn't have two adjacent carbonyls. So, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism because the structure doesn't allow for enol formation.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trioneâ€”since each of the adjacent CH2 groups is between two carbonyls, it should be able to tautomerize. Wait, but wait, I'm confused. If all three carbonyls are present, maybe the structure is such that the enol form is possible
