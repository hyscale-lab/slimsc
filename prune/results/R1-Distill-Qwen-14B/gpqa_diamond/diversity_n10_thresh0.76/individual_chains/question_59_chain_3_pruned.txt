Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my acid-base chemistry, but I'll think it through.

The problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I remember that mixing acids and bases can lead to neutralization reactions, so I should probably figure out if they react with each other first.

Wait, but wait... first, I should calculate the moles of each substance because that's key in determining the excess of acid or base.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: volume is 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: volume is 300 mL, 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. But wait, Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- would be 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles. Wait, let me calculate that again. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles OH-.

Now, the problem is mixing an acid (CH3COOH and HCl) with a base (Ba(OH)2). So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, providing
