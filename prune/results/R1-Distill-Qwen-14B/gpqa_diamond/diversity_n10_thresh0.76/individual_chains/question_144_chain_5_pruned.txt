Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. 

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the mean decay distance has to do with the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean path or proper length is calculated using gamma (Lorentz factor) multiplied by the proper lifetime (cτ) and then multiplied by the velocity (βc), or something like that. Wait, I think the formula is L = γ * β * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right! The mean lifetime τ is related to the total decay width Γ. The formula is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, since Γ is given in MeV, I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ. Oh, and I remember that ħc is a common term in such calculations. Let me think: ħc is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, right?

So first, let's compute τ. Γ is 320 MeV, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is in J·s, but
