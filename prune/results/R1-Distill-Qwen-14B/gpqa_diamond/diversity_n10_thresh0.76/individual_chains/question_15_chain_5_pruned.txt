Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, which means the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view. They have limited time, so they need to choose the better candidate.

Both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. From RV, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter orbital period.

Wait, Kepler's third law might come into play here. The period relates to the distance. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since both have same mass (and M for the star is much larger), the period is proportional to a^(3/2). So if Planet_1's period is shorter by a factor of 3, then (P1/P2) = 1/3. So (a1/a2)^(3/2) = 1/3. Let me compute that: (a1/a2)^3 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9. So (a1/a2) = (1/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.48. So a1 is about 48% of a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

But wait, the question states that both have circular orbits, so that's straightforward.

Now, the host stars: the star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up same radius. Interesting, so same R*, but M1* = 2 * M2*. Wait, but radius isn't necessarily determined by mass alone. For example, white dwarfs are small but massive, but main sequence stars, more mass usually means larger radius. But in this case, both have same R*, so maybe they are different types or in different stages. But anyway, we just take it as given.
