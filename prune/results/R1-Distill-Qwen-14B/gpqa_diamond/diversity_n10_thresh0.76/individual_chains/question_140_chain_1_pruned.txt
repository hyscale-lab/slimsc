Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y. Let me read through the details again.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

Alright, let's start by identifying the possible substances involved.

First, gas W. It has equal protons and neutrons. Possible candidates are H2O (neutrons: O is 8, so H2O has 10 neutrons (since O-16 has 8 neutrons, H has none? Wait, H2O: H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons each, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2 (from H) +8=10. Neutrons: 8. Oh wait, that doesn't match. So maybe another gas. Alternatively, maybe another gas where the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, another possibility is CO2. Let's see: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6+8*2= 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2=22. So 22 each. That fits. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. But another possibility is H2O, but as I calculated earlier, protons would be 10, neutrons 8, so not same. So perhaps CO2 is a better fit.

Wait, another option: CH4. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (assuming C-12). H has 1 each. So CH4: 6+4=10 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 4*(0) =6
