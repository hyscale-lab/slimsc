Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is falling vertically on this aperture. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. The angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The most common case I know is the single slit diffraction, where the minima occur at certain angles determined by the width of the slit.

Wait, but this isn't a single slit; it's an N-sided polygon. Oh, but the problem says N is infinitely large. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinitely many sides approximates a circle.

Oh, right! So when the aperture is circular, the diffraction pattern is the familiar single-slit circular aperture pattern. The minima in that case are given by certain conditions. Let me recall the formula for the minima in a circular aperture.

I think for a single circular aperture, the minima occur where the Bessel function of the first kind has its zeros. The first minimum is at a certain angle, and the second at another. But wait, the problem is talking about the first two minima. So the first minimum after the central maximum is the first dark ring, and the second would be the next one.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. In single-slit diffraction, the minima are given by the condition a sinθ = mλ, where a is the slit width, and m is an integer. But for a circular aperture, it's a bit different. The minima for a circular aperture are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1, I believe. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, and the second at another.

Right, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is a sinθ = (m - 0.5) λ, where m is an integer (like 1, 2, 3...). Wait, no, isn't the first minimum for a circular aperture at a sin
