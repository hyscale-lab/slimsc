Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because it orbits faster. Also, the host stars have the same radius, even though the star of Planet_1 has twice the mass. Oh right, more massive stars are usually bigger, but here they have the same radius, so they might be similar in size but different in mass.

I think the transit probability depends on a few factors. The formula I recall is something like P = (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the semi-major axis or something related to the orbital period. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's P ∝ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2 R_s)) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. But the probability is more about the alignment. The formula I've heard is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e²)^½), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that part is 1. So the transit probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (R_s * (1 - (R_p^2/(a^2)) )^(1/2)) ) ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, the probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a) / (R_s * sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2)) ) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of geometry.
