Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and chromatography concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that two reactions are performed, and then their products are combined. After that, they're run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. We need to find out how many peaks appear in each, which depends on the number of different compounds formed and whether they're chiral or not.

First, let me look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, right? So when LAH reduces it, the ketone group (C=O) would become a secondary alcohol. So the product of Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, is there any other functional group here that would react with LAH? I don't think so. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon. Also, since the starting material is an S configuration, after reduction, the configuration might change, but since the reaction is a ketone to alcohol, the configuration at the chiral center would be determined by the starting material. Wait, wait, the starting material has the (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group? Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the substituents on the 3rd carbon (the ketone) are: the main chain and the methoxy on the 5th carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(C=O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, no. Let me think: hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, I think the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no,
