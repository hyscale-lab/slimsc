Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to find out what X is from the options A to D.

Wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent, right? Oh, I think it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, that's for epoxidizing epoxides in allylic alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's used for other epoxide-related reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a catalyst, I think. Or is it a base? Hmm, maybe it's part of the conditions for an epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product's NMR suggests certain structures. Let me look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows signals at 2.28 and 2.31, both singlets, each 3H. So two methyl groups, probably attached to something that doesn't split their signals. So maybe they're both attached to carbons that don't have neighboring Hs, like possibly adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a ring structure.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Hmm. So that's four doublets. Let me think about coupling patterns. Maybe a para-substituted benzene with substituents causing splitting. Or perhaps a styryl group (like a benzene ring connected via a double bond to another group).

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7, which is a ketone? Or maybe an ester or another carbonyl group. Oh wait, but looking at the options, some are oxiranes, which are epoxides. Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So if the product has an epoxide, maybe that's the structure.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, wait, I think that's used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right! That reagent is used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which is an oxidation of alkenes to epoxides using a peracid in the presence of a base like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So if compound X is an alkene, reacting with that would form an epoxide.

So the product is an epoxide, perhaps. So looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: So that's an oxirane (epoxide) where one of the carbons is connected to a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a benzene ring attached via a double bond.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: So the oxirane has a substituent that's a propenyl group attached to a phenyl, in a way that the substituent on the epoxide is at position 2, maybe.

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: So the oxirane has a methyl group and a styryl group on adjacent carbons. So the epoxide ring has two substituents.

D) 2-styrylepoxide: That is, the oxirane has a styryl group attached to the second carbon.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR shows a singlet for two methyl groups. So if the product has a methyl group adjacent to the epoxide, or maybe a substituent on the styryl group that includes a methyl.

Let me think about what the NMR data shows. The 1H NMR has two singlet methyls, so maybe two CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, if there's a methyl attached, but
