Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma is calculated as gamma = E / (m c²), right? Because energy E is gamma m c². But wait, the units here are GeV, and mass is in GeV/c², I think. So when E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then gamma is E/(m c²) where c is in appropriate units.

Wait, actually, gamma is E / (m c²). Let me check the units. E is in GeV, m c² is (GeV/c²) * (c²) = GeV. So yes, gamma is E/(m c²). But wait, when we write E in natural units, c is set to 1, so E would be gamma m, because E = gamma m c², and if c=1, then E=gamma m. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV/c². Its energy is 27 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²). But E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.918. So gamma is about 7.918.

So the lab frame lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-1
