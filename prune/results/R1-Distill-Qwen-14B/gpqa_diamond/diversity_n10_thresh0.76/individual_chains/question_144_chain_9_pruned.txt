Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Let me try to recall what I know about particle physics and decay processes.

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. Hmm.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula for the mean decay length (L) is given by L = c * τ * βγ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame), and βγ is the Lorentz factor multiplied by the velocity factor. Wait, wait. Or is it β times gamma? Let me think. Beta (β) is v/c, and gamma (γ) is 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So βγ is β multiplied by gamma. So yeah, the formula is L = c * τ * βγ.

But how do I find τ, the proper lifetime? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think it's τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

So putting that together, L = c * (ħ / Γ) * βγ.

But I also need to calculate β and γ for the particle. How do I do that? Well, the particle is moving with some energy E. The mass is m, so the energy E is the total energy of the particle, which is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = γ m c². So γ can be found as E/(m c²). Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²).

Wait, but the energy given is E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is
