Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which means a six-membered transition state is involved. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes, right? So the starting material must be a diene structure.

The molecule given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to draw its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. So the molecule has a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. The substituents are 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo, which means there's a nitrogen in the ring.

Wait, the 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene part: the numbering starts so that the bridges are between carbons 1, 2, 4, and 5? Let me think. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has bridgeheads at positions 1, 4, and maybe another position. Oh wait, the numbering for bicyclo[m.n.p] is such that the largest bridge is between 1 and the next highest number, then the other bridges are determined. So for [2.2.1], the main bridge is between 1 and 5, another between 5 and 7, and the third between 7 and 1? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like norbornene, where there's a double bond.

Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo system has seven atoms, and the substituents are on carbon 2. So the structure has a bridge, and on carbon 2, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), and an azabicyclo group. Wait, no: it's 2-azabicyclo, which probably means that the nitrogen is at position 2 of the bicyclo system.

So the molecule is a bicyclic system with a double bond at position 5 (hept-
