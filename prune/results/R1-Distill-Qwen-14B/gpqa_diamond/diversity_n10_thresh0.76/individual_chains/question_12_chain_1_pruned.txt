Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember from my studies that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they produce other particles. The problem gives me the masses of the Pi(+) and the mu(+), and I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. 

Wait, the pion is stationary, so this is a decay at rest scenario. I think in such cases, the total momentum of the products after decay has to be zero because the initial momentum was zero. So the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. 

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little massâ€”like, almost massless. So when the pion decays into a muon and a neutrino, the muon's mass is much larger than the neutrino's, which is negligible. So the muon's mass would dominate the energy considerations. 

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is practically massless, so maybe I can ignore its rest mass for simplicity. 

I think the key here is conservation of energy and
