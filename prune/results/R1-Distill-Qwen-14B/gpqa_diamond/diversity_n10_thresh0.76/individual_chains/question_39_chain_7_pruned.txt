Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about an ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the position of the particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1. But wait, the wave function given has a real part and an imaginary part. Wait, is it written as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, or is it a product of those terms? Oh, no, looking again, the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i. So ψ(x) is a complex function with a real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part of -0.5.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. To compute the probability density, I need to take the modulus squared of ψ(x). So |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So Re(ψ) is a/sqrt(1+x), Im(ψ) is -0.5.

So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Wait, (-0.5i) squared is (0.25), because i squared is -1, but when you square the imaginary part, you get (0.5)^2 * (i)^2 = 0.25*(-1), but wait, no, wait: |Im(ψ)|² is (0.5)^2, because the modulus is the
