Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about dissolving iron hydroxide in an acid. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking for two things: the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with different pH values and volumes.

First, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be important here. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH-). Breaking it down: Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16 +1), so 3 *17 =51. So total molar mass is 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, another way: Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so iron, three hydroxides. Each hydroxide is O and H. So yeah, 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. So molar mass is 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles would be mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles. So roughly 9.358e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it dissolves in an acid, it should react. Since it's a hydroxide, it probably reacts with H+ ions from the acid. Let's write the reaction.

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Yeah, that makes sense. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions for dissolution.

So, the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 0.0009358 mol * 3 = 0.0028074 mol of H+ needed.

The acid provided is a monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So 0.1 M acid. Molarity is moles per liter. So, the volume needed (V) is moles / Molarity.

So V = 0.0028074 / 0.1 = 0.028074 liters. Which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is close. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher, and option A is 32, which is even higher. So perhaps option C is the correct volume?

Wait, but wait. There's something else to consider. The solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the total volume might change. Oh, but wait, the problem says "prepare the solution" in a 100 cm³ total volume. So perhaps the acid is added to some solvent (like water) to make up 100 cm³. But for the reaction, only the amount of H+ is important.

Wait, but the acid's concentration is 0.1 M. So perhaps I need to find the volume of acid (V) such that when added to 100 cm³ of solution, the moles of H+ from the acid are sufficient to react with Fe(OH)3.

Wait, another approach: The total solution is 100 cm³. The acid is monobasic, so its concentration is 0.1 M. So the moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.1 * V_acid, where V_acid is in liters.

But when you add V_acid to 100 cm³, the total volume is 100 + V_acid? Or is it just 100 cm³? Hmm, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, the question says "in 100 cm3 total volume." So when you dissolve the Fe(OH)3, the total solution is 100 cm³. So the acid is added to make up the solution to 100 cm³. Hmm, but that complicates things. Because adding the acid would contribute to the volume.

Wait, but perhaps the approach is to assume that the acid is the solvent, and the volume of acid is V, which contributes to the total 100 cm³. So V_acid + (other volume) = 100 cm³. But perhaps I can approximate that the volume of the acid is much smaller than 100 cm³, so that adding V cm³ doesn't significantly change the total volume.
