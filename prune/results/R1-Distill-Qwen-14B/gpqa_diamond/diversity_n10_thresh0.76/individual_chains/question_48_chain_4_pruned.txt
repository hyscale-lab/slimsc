Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which is Br2. I think when ketones react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. Wait, but under what conditions? Oh right, cyclohexanone can undergo ring-opening when treated with bromine. Or wait, maybe it's an enol formation? Or perhaps it's a bromination via some other mechanism. Alternatively, I've heard of cyclohexanone undergoing a diels-alder reaction with something else, but that's not bromine. Hmm.

Wait, no, bromine in a suitable solvent, perhaps. Oh wait, cyclohexanone can undergo bromine addition via an enol intermediate. So when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with an excess of bromine, it forms a dibromide. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the addition would be intramolecular. Wait, no, maybe it's an attack on the carbonyl group. Oh, right, I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it can lead to the formation of a 1,2-dibromide. So the carbonyl oxygen attacks Br2, and then the carbonyl group is converted into a bromide.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanism. Alternatively, I think that cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form a bromohydrin. Oh wait, no, that's when you have a ketone reacting with HBr or something else. Or perhaps, if you have a cyclic ketone, bromine would add across the carbonyl, leading to a diepoxide or something? No, wait, the correct reaction is that cyclohexanone reacts with bromine in a dihydroxylation, but no, that's for alkenes. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. Product 1 is formed by treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Another possibility is that bromine is acting as an electrophilic reagent. Alternatively, since cyclohex
