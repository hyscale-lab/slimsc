Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C. They give the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is, I think, a 1:1 complex because EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) typically forms complexes where one EDTA molecule binds to one metal ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant, K, is given. K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. But the problem says the pH is ideal, so perhaps we can assume that the form we need is present. Maybe all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and works best under certain pH conditions where it's deprotonated. So I should consider that the concentration of EDTA is equal to the concentration of Y^4-.

Wait, but the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Because the complex is dissociated into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but the formation constant is so large that the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be really low.

Wait, let me think again. The formation constant K is given as 5e10. That's a big number, so the complex is very stable. So the dissociation of CaEDTA^2- into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- is very small.

The problem is, what's the concentration of Ca²+ in solution? Well, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. If the complex dissociates a little, let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Then the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for each mole of complex dissociated, you get one mole of each ion. The complex's concentration would be approximately 0.02 - x. Since K is very large, x is going to be really small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the equation becomes K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → 2e-3 /5e10 is (2/5
