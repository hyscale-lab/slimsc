Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I remember that in atoms, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. But since m is small here, maybe l isn't too large either. For hydrogen, the orbitals are s, p, d, etc., corresponding to l=0,1,2... So maybe m is 0 or ±1 or something like that.

The paramagnetic coupling term... I think that refers to the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic dipole energy is given by the Hamiltonian term H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l) m, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's μ = (eħ/(2m_e c)) * m, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's μ = μ_B m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.27e-24 J/T. So the energy would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the energy would be proportional to m times B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be on the order of μ_B * B * m, but wait, the sign depends on the direction, but the magnitude is what's important here.

Wait, but the problem says m is small. So if m is small, say m=0, then the term would vanish. But if m is ±1, it's small. But the orbital angular momentum's effect is probably weaker compared to other terms. Hmm.

But wait, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I'll call H_p) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition energy here is given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which is the Balmer series' first line, the H-alpha line. The energy of that transition is ΔE = hc/λ. So let me compute that.

Calculating ΔE: Planck constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let me do the math. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 0.4861e-6 is approximately 4.085e-19 J. Wait, wait, no, wait: 0.4861e-6 m is 4.861e-7 m. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.085e-19 Joules.

But wait, I remember that for hydrogen transitions, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for the Balmer transition, n=2 to n=1. So E2 - E1 would be ( (-13.6/4) - (-13.6/1) ) eV = ( -3.4 +13.6 ) = 10.2 eV. Wait, but that's the ionization potential. Wait no, the transition from n=2 to n=1 emits a photon of energy 10.2 eV? No, wait, no. Wait, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_n=2 is -3.4 eV, E_n=1 is -13.6 eV. So the energy difference ΔE is (-3.4) - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV. Oh wait, no, because when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy E_high - E_low? Wait no, E_high is less negative than E_low. So 2 to 1: ΔE = E2 - E1 = (-3.4) - (-13.6) )= 10.2 eV. But 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 10.2 eV is 10.2 *1.602e-19 ≈ 1.628e-18 J. Hmm, that's different from the previous calculation. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's redo the wavelength approach. hc/lambda. h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. λ=0.4861e-6 m. So hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by λ=0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.085e-19 J. 4.085e-19 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.085e-19 /1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that's about 2.55 eV. But earlier with the E_n formula, I got 10.2 eV. Hmmm. That's a discrepancy. Which is correct?

Wait, wait, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=2 to n=1? Or wait, no. Let me think. Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So for Balmer-alpha, it's n=3 to n=2. Because the Balmer series is for transitions ending at n=2. The first line is n=3 to n=2 (H-alpha), which has a wavelength about 656 nm. Wait, but the problem states λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm. Oh wait! That's the Balmer-beta line, from n=4 to n=2? Or maybe I'm getting the lines mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me look up the Balmer series: H-alpha is 656 nm (n=3→2), H-beta is 486 nm (n=4→2), H-gamma is 434 nm (n=5→2), etc. So in this problem, λ=0.4861 μm = 486 nm, so n=4→2. So ΔE is E_4 - E_2 = [ -13.6 / (4)^2 ] - [ -13.6 / (2)^2 ] = (-1.7) - (-3.4) )= 1.7 eV. So 1.7 eV is the energy difference. Then, 1.7 eV is 1.7 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.723e-19 J. Wait, but earlier when I did hc/lambda, I got about 4.085e-19 J, which is about 2.55 eV. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute hc/lambda again. h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. λ=0.4861e-6 m. So hc/lambda is 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 1.9878 / 0.4861 = approx 4.085, times 1e-19. So 4.085e-19 J, which is 4.085e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. But according to the energy levels, the ΔE should be 1.7 eV. Hmm, discrepancy here. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I messed up the wavelength for the transition. Wait, another approach: the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), where n1 < n2. For the Balmer series, n1=2. So for the Balmer-alpha line, n2=3: 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/9) = R*(5/36). R is about 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/λ = 1.097e7 * (5/36) ≈ 1.53e6 m^-1. So λ ≈ 1/(1.53e6) ≈ 6.53e-7 m = 653 nm, which matches H-alpha.

For the Balmer-beta line, n2=4. So 1/λ = R*(1/4 - 1/16) = R*(3/16) ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.1875 ≈ 2.05e6 m^-1. So λ ≈ 4.88e-7 m = 488 nm, which is close to 0.4861e-6 m. So yes, this corresponds to the transition n=4→2, with ΔE = E4 - E2. So E4 is -13.6/(4)^2 = -13.6/16 = -0.85 eV. E2 is -13.6/(2)^2 = -3.4 eV. So ΔE = (-0.85) - (-3.4) )= 2.55 eV. Ah, which matches the hc/lambda calculation! So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought I was getting 1.7 eV. So ΔE is indeed about 2.55 eV, which is approximately 2.55 eV, or 4.08e-19 J.

Wait, okay, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV, which is 4.08e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. The paramagnetic term is due to the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. For an electron in an atomic orbital, the magnetic moment is given by μ = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton, approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

The energy of the magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the energy is H = -μ_B * m * B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be about μ_B * B * m, but since the energy is negative when m is positive (because B is in the same direction as μ when m is positive?), but the magnitude is what's important here.

Wait, but wait. The paramagnetic term also depends on the spin, but I think in this context, the question refers to the orbital magnetic moment, not the spin. Because if it were the spin, then m_s would be ±1/2, and the term would be proportional to that. But the question says m is small, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So, for an electron in an orbital with l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So for m=1, the term would be μ_B * B * 1.

Wait, but wait: The orbital magnetic quantum number m can be from -l to +l. So for a p orbital (l=1), m can be -1, 0, +1. For a d orbital (l=2), m can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. But the problem says small m, so perhaps m is 0 or ±1.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term would be on the order of μ_B * B * m. Let's compute that. Let's take m=1, which is the maximum for small m. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So H = μ_B * B * m = 9.27e-24 *1 *1 = 9.27e-24 J.

But wait, we're comparing this to the transition energy ΔE which is 4.08e-19 J. So 9.27e-24 J is much smaller than 4.08e-19 J. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are we considering the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic term, or is it the splitting between different m states in the same energy level?

Wait, the paramagnetic term causes a splitting of the energy levels depending on m. The energy shift for each m is ΔE_p = μ_B * B * m. So for each m, the shift is small relative to the main energy level.

But the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is this shift) to the transition energy ΔE, which is the energy difference between two levels in the hydrogen atom.

Wait, but wait, the transition energy is about 2.55 eV, or 4e-19 J, and the paramagnetic shift for m=1 is about 9e-24 J, which is about 1e-5 times smaller. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the question is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. Since ⟨H⟩ is on the order of 1e-23 J (if m is 1, μ_B is ~1e-23 J/T, B=1 T: 1e-23*1=1e-23 J?) Wait, let me compute μ_B. μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. So for m=1, H = 9.27e-24 *1 *1 = 9.27e-24 J. Which is 9.27e-24 J. Compared to ΔE which is 4e-19 J. So 9e-24 is much smaller than 4e-19. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So, the paramagnetic term is much less than ΔE. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → No, not close.

B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE → No, it's way smaller.

C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE → Yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → No.

So the correct answer is option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze both quantities based on the given parameters.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy is determined using the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm, which corresponds to the Balmer-beta line (n=4 → n=2). The energy difference is calculated using the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( R \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), \( n_1 = 2 \), and \( n_2 = 4 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \cdot \frac{3}{16} \approx 2.05 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1}{2.05 \times 10^6} \approx 4.88 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}.
\]

The transition energy is then calculated using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.085 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.085 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy is given by:

\[
H = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B},
\]

where the magnetic moment \( \vec{\mu} \) is proportional to the orbital magnetic quantum number \( m \). For an electron, the magnetic moment is:

\[
\vec{\mu} = \mu_B m \hat{z},
\]

with \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) being the Bohr magneton. Since \( \vec{B} \) is along the \( z \)-axis and has a magnitude of \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), the energy is:

\[
H = -\mu_B B m.
\]

For small \( m \), such as \( m = 1 \), the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is:

\[
|H| = \mu_B B |m| = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 4.085 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is compared to the paramagnetic coupling term \( |H| \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \). Clearly, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy:

\[
|H| \ll \Delta E.
\]

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
