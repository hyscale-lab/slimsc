Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods. The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth. 

The given data points:
- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.
Wait, actually, the ratio is between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So does that mean T1 is 1.4 times T2? Or the other way? Hmm, wording says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So I think that would be T1 over T2 is 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3? Or T3/T2? Wait, the wording says "between Planet2 and Planet3", so I think it's T2 over T3 is 2.3, so T2 = 2.3 * T3. That way, Planet2 is hotter than Planet3.

Wait, maybe I should be careful. Let's think. If the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between P1 and P2 is 1.4, then T1/T2 = 1.4. So T1 is hotter. That makes sense if P1 is closer to the star because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. Because, as per the inverse square law, the temperature scales with distance as T ∝ (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), but perhaps a simpler way is to think in terms of T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), since the flux (which depends on L/(4πd²)) is proportional to 1/d², and the equilibrium temperature is (flux*(1 - albedo)/4)^(1/4), so T ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).
