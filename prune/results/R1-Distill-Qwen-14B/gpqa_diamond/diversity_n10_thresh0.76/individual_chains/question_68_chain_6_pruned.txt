Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's magnetic moment mu is aligned with the field, so mu is along Z. The magnetic moment mu is gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction, which for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So mu would be gamma*(ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices or something like that.

But when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's state is an eigenstate of Sz. So the expectation value of Sz would be either plus or minus gamma*ħ/2 divided by 2? Wait, no, mu is gamma S_z, so S_z is ħ/2 times sigma_z maybe. So mu_z would be gamma*(ħ/2) * (+1 or -1). So the initial expectation value is either plus or minus (gamma ħ /2). But I'm not sure if that's important right now.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along Y. Both have the same magnitude B. So now the magnetic field is along Y. The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so the magnetic moment will precess around the Y-axis now because the magnetic field is along Y. The oscillations in the expectation value of S_z (and hence mu_z) would come from the time dependence of the state when it's subjected to a magnetic field.

I think this is a problem about the time evolution of a spin in a magnetic field. The magnetic field in the Y-direction would cause the spin to precess, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.
