Okay, I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm. Let me think. The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density.

So, the options are a) to d), each with different properties. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each option, I need to calculate or figure out their densities and compare.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. Since both mass and radius are same as Earth, the density should be the same as Earth's. So 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the density is given directly here. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, the question is about which has the highest. So maybe not the highest.

Wait, wait, no. Let me read again. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of ~5.5. So that might not be correct because if the mass is higher, unless the radius increases, the density would be higher than Earth's. Wait wait, no, because if the mass is double but the density is same, that implies that the radius is scaled in a way that (mass doubles, density same) so radius would be (2)^(1/3) times Earth's radius. Because density = mass/volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³. So if density is same, then mass is proportional to r³. So if mass is 2×, r is cube root of 2 times Earth's radius.

But regardless, option b's density is given as 5.5. So in terms of this question, which asks for the highest density, it's 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c) is a planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth means same density. Because if the composition is same, then their densities should be same. Because density depends on composition. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density is also 5.5. So same as a), b), and c) but let me make sure. Wait, but wait, the mass is 5 times Earth's. Since density is mass/volume, and density is same as Earth, that would mean the radius is larger
