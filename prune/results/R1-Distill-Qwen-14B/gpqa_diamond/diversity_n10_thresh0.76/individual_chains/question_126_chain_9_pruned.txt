Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to determine how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case, and then choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I need to understand what each reaction does. Let's tackle them one by one.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH stands for Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain, with a ketone group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So it's (S) configuration, but the exact stereochemistry might matter for the product.

When LAH reduces a ketone, it typically converts R2CO into R2CH-OH. So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol, but wait, the position is important. So, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would reduce to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, since the starting material is a chiral center at position 5, because the methoxy is on C5, which is attached to four different groups: the adjacent carbons (C4 and C6), the methoxy group, and the hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO..., so the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3. So positions 1,2,3
