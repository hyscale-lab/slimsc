Okay, so I've got this problem about the Hamiltonian operator and finding its eigenvalues. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics is an operator that gives the energy of the system. The question gives me H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices... Oh right, they're the σx, σy, σz matrices. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. And the dot product with n probably means n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix.

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the determinant of (H - λI) = 0. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut because the Pauli matrices have some properties that could make this easier.

Wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. Oh, but in this case, H is a combination of them scaled by ε. Let me think: since σ · n is a sum of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding direction's unit vector component, the resulting matrix's eigenvalues should be related to the magnitude of the vector.

Wait, another approach. The Pauli matrices are traceless and each has trace zero. Wait, no, wait. The Pauli matrices individually have trace zero. So σ · n would be a matrix with trace zero as well, because the sum of Pauli
