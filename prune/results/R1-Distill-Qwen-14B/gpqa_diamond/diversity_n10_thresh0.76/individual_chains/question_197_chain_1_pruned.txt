Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, I'm thinking this is a type of reaction where maybe a functional group is being modified. Red phosphorus and HI... that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the situation for the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, right? So if Compound X has a ketone group, reacting it with Clemmensen reagents would remove the carbonyl and form a CH2 group.

But wait, let me not get ahead of myself. Let me first analyze the given IR and NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Then I can determine what happens when it reacts.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually corresponds to O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the other peaks, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 suggests maybe a ketone or an aldehyde, but aldehydes are usually higher, around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H, which I don't see here. Wait, the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the region for aromatic C=C stretching. So this compound probably has an aromatic ring with substituents, and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's quite upfield for a proton—wait, no, 10.5 is actually a high ppm value. Typically, that's indicative of an acidic proton, like an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, looking at the integration, it's 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, the peak is at 10.5, so maybe more towards a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait—if it's a carbonyl group, and the IR shows 1720, which is more in line with a ketone or aldehyde than a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have O-H stretches in IR too, but they usually have a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is present here as 3400–2500. So maybe it's a ketone with an O-H group? Or perhaps a substituted aromatic ring with a ketone and some other functional groups.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl like a ketone or ester. Also, the
