Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, rest-mass energy is given by E=mc², so the rest mass M must be 300 GeV/c², but I guess I don't need to worry about the units too much right now.

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, let me call the masses m1 and m2. Let's say m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 * m2. The sum of their masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. 

Since m1 is twice m2, substituting m1 = 2m2 into the sum gives 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3. That simplifies to m2 = 0.33 M. Wait, no, 0.99 divided by 3 is 0.33, but more accurately, 0.99/3 is 0.33 exactly? Wait, 3 times 0.33 is 0.99, right? So m2 is 0.33 M, and m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, no, wait. Because 3m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M. So m1 is twice m2, which makes sense.

Now, the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1). So the question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the T1 calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

I remember that in fission, the nucleus splits into two parts, and since the whole system is initially at rest, the total momentum must be conserved. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. But since their masses are different, their velocities will be different.

Wait, in classical mechanics, when a system is at rest and splits into two masses, they move with velocities such that their momenta cancel each other. So for masses m1 and m2, and velocities v1 and v2, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but opposite in direction. So v1 = (m2/m1) v2. Since m1 is twice m2, v1 would be (m2/m1) v2 = (1/2) v2. Or wait, no, because m1 v1 equals m2 v2 in magnitude but opposite direction. So m1 v1 = - m2 v2. So v1 = -(m2/m1) v2. So substituting m1=2m2, v1 = - (m2/(2m2)) v2 = -(1/2) v2. So the more massive fragment (m1) would have a velocity that's half that of the lighter one, but in the opposite direction.

But this is the classical approach. The problem is about the kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy in classical terms would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

But wait, in reality, since the fission is happening in the nucleus, which is at rest, and the fragments fly apart, the total energy includes their rest mass energies and kinetic energy.

But wait, in the problem, the question is about the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the non-relativistic approximation. So we have to compute both and subtract.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute the velocities and kinetic energies in both relativistic and non-relativistic cases.

But wait, how do I find the velocities? Since in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So each fragment's momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

In the non-relativistic case, momentum is m v. So m1 v1 = m2 v2. Hmm, as I thought earlier.

But in the relativistic case, momentum is gamma m v. So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. But this complicates things because the velocities are relativistic.

Wait, but for kinetic energy, the energy comes from the total energy minus rest mass energy. So the total energy of each fragment is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So the kinetic energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) - m c².

But perhaps there's a simpler approach. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but wait. The rest masses of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c², but the total initial rest mass is M c², which is 300 GeV. But the sum of the fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and after the split, the rest mass energy is 297 GeV. So the remaining energy, 3 GeV, must be the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

That's a key point. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v² for each fragment. But since the momenta are equal and opposite, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (since in non-relativistic, p = mv). So m1 v1 = m2 v2. 

Given that m1 is twice m2, so substituting, 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2. So 2 v1 = v2. So v2 is twice v1.

Now, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

Substituting, T1_classical = (1/2) (2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

T2_classical = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) )= 2 m2 v1².

So T1_classical is m2 v1², T2 is 2 m2 v1². So sum is 3 m2 v1².

But we know that T1 + T2 =3 GeV, so 3 m2 v1^2 =3 GeV. So m2 v1^2 =1 GeV.

So T1_classical is m2 v1² =1 GeV.

But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. But in reality, since the fragments are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a substitution mistake. Let me check:

Because the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV, which in non-relativistic case gives T1_classical as 1 GeV, T2 as 2 GeV. So the correct approach probably is that the relativistic T1 is less than the classical approximation? Or maybe higher? Hmm, not so sure.

Wait, no, sometimes relativistic effects can make the kinetic energy higher or lower. Let me think.

In the non-relativistic case, we have T1_classical = 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV. But in reality, the correct T1 is higher or lower?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about energies. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But in reality, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So for each fragment, their kinetic energy is T = (gamma -1) m c².

But how does that compare to the non-relativistic case?

At low speeds, gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), so (gamma -1) m c² ≈ (v²/(2c²)) m c² = (1/2) m v². So, the non-relativistic KE is a good approximation when v is small compared to c.

But in this case, the fragments are moving, so their velocities might be significant. So their kinetic energies might be higher than the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the sum is 3 GeV, so each fragment's KE is 1 GeV and 2 GeV.

But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so the binding energy released is 3 GeV (300 - 297). So that 3 GeV is the kinetic energy for both fragments. So in reality, each fragment's KE is relativistic.

Wait, but wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. The fragments' rest mass is 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is split between the two kinetic energies.

In non-relativistic case, the sum is 3 GeV, with m1 getting 1 GeV and m2 getting 2 GeV. But in reality, the actual KEs will be different.

But to find the actual KEs, we need to think about the relativistic scenario.

So let's model this.

In the center of mass frame (which is the initial rest frame), the two fragments move with equal and opposite momenta. So p1 = -p2.

In relativistic terms, the momentum p is gamma m v.

So for fragment 1 (m1), p1 = gamma1 m1 v1.

For fragment 2 (m2), p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since p1 = -p2, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

We also know from non-relativistic case that v1 = (m2/(m1)) v2, but that's only when non-relativistic.

Wait, but in reality, because velocity is involved, I think the approach is to use the conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after fission is zero. So p1 + p2 =0.

Which implies that p1 = - p2.

Expressed as:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Additionally, the total energy after fission is sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

The initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV.

The rest energies of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c². So their sum is 297 GeV.

The kinetic energies are T1 and T2, which sum to 3 GeV.

So the total energy after fission is 297 + 3 = 300 GeV, which matches the initial energy. So that's correct.

So now, to find T1 and T2, we need to solve for velocities and momenta.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Since the system is symmetric in terms of momentum, perhaps we can find the velocities in terms of their masses.

Wait, the mass ratio is m1/m2 = 2.

Let me denote m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, gamma1 * 2m * v1 = gamma2 * m * v2.

Simplify: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Another equation comes from the fact that the kinetic energies sum to 3 GeV.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) 2m c²,

T2 = (gamma2 -1) m c².

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But this seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a way to relate the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the velocities in terms of each other.

In the non-relativistic case, we have v1 = (m2/(m1)) v2 = (1/2) v2.

But in reality, with relativistic speeds, this might not hold. Hmm.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, v1 is (1/2) v2. But in the relativistic case, since the velocities are higher, perhaps the relationship between v1 and v2 is different.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the velocities. Let me think.

From the momentum conservation equation: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So, (gamma2/gamma1) = (2 v1)/(v2).

Hmm, but I don't know the velocities yet.

Wait, perhaps if I square both sides, I can relate the velocities squared.

Alternatively, consider the kinetic energies.

We have T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

Expressed as:

[ (gamma1 -1) 2m c² ] + [ (gamma2 -1) m c² ] =3 GeV.

Divide both sides by m c²:

2(gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) =3 / (m c²).

But m c² is the rest energy of the fragment m2. Wait, m is m2, so m c² is m2 c². So what is m2 c²?

The sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV. Since m1 + m2 = (2m + m) =3m =0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. So m c² = 0.33 M c² = 0.33 * 300 GeV =99 GeV.

So m2 c² =99 GeV.

Ah, so the rest energy of m2 is 99 GeV, and m1 is 198 GeV (since m1 is 2m, so 2 *99 =198 GeV).

So, substituting m c²=99 GeV into the equation:

2(gamma1 -1) *198 GeV/c² * c² + (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV =3 GeV.

Wait, no, hold on. The kinetic energies are T1 = (gamma1 -1) * m1 c² and T2 = (gamma2 -1) * m2 c².

So, T1 + T2 = (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV + (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV =3 GeV.

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) +99 (gamma2-1) =3 GeV.

Let me write that as equation (1):

198 gamma1 -198 +99 gamma2 -99 =3

So,

198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =3 + 198 +99 = 300.

So,

198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =300/99 ≈3.0303.

Wait, 300 /99 is approximately 3.0303.

So equation (1a): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

And from earlier, we have equation (2): 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But we need another equation involving v1 and v2.

Also, from the velocity relationship in the non-relativistic case, we might have v2 =2 v1, but that's only when velocities are non-relativistic. In reality, that might not hold. So perhaps we can't use that.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate the velocities using the relativistic momentum equation.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. Let's say the more massive fragment has velocity v, and the lighter has velocity u.

From momentum conservation: gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

Since m1=2m, m2=m.

So,

gamma1 * 2m * v = gamma2 * m * u.

Simplify:

2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

So,

u = (2 gamma1 v)/(gamma2).

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Another approach: Express gamma in terms of velocity.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2).

But this might complicate the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the kinetic energies to the velocities. Since T = (gamma -1) m c².

But I'm stuck with too many variables. Maybe I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the fragments are moving in opposite directions, but the system's center of momentum is still at rest.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the velocity of the fragments are such that the momentum is conserved.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the ratio of the kinetic energies. Since m1 is twice m2, perhaps the kinetic energies are in a certain ratio.

Wait, from equation (1a): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

And from the momentum equation, 2 gamma1 v = gamma2 u.

But without knowing v and u, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe I can express gamma2 from equation (1a).

gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substitute into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 v = (3.0303 -2 gamma1) u.

Hmm, but I don't know u in terms of v.

Wait, perhaps I can write the velocity of the light fragment (u) in terms of the heavy one's (v). Let me think.

In the center of momentum frame, the two fragments move with velocities v and u in opposite directions.

Wait, but in the rest frame of the nucleus, after fission, the two move with velocities v and u such that their momenta cancel each other.

So, the speed of the heavier fragment is v, and the lighter is u.

But how are v and u related?

In non-relativistic case, the momentum is m1 v = m2 u.

Which gives (2m) v = m u → u=2v.

So, in non-relativistic, u=2v.

But in reality, with relativistic speeds, this will change.

Hmm.

But perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, the non-relativistic assumption gives a value of T1=1 GeV, and the correct value is higher or lower.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1.

So, perhaps I can compute T1_classical and T1_relativistic, then find the difference.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic approach gives T1 =1 GeV, and the relativistic approach would have T1 higher or lower.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the energy.

In the non-relativistic case, the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV, with T1=1 GeV and T2=2 GeV.

But in reality, the kinetic energies are (gamma-1)m c².

So, let's compute what gamma would be.

Wait, but without knowing the velocities, perhaps I can find the ratio of the kinetic energies.

Wait, the kinetic energy in relativistic terms is T = gamma m c² - m c².

So, T = (gamma -1)m c².

So, T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

T2 = (gamma2 -1) *99 GeV.

From equation (1a): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

So,

gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Thus, T2 = (3.0303 -2 gamma1 -1)*99 GeV.

= (2.0303 -2 gamma1)*99 GeV.

Wait, but T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So,

( gamma1 -1 ) *198 + (2.0303 -2 gamma1 ) *99 =3.

Let me compute that:

198 (gamma1 -1) +99 * (2.0303 -2 gamma1) =3.

Expand:

198 gamma1 -198 + (99 *2.0303) - (99 *2 gamma1) )=3.

Calculate 99*2.0303: 99 *2 is 198, 99 *0.0303 is approximately 2.9997. So total is about 200.9997 GeV.

So,

198 gamma1 -198 +200.9997 -198 gamma1 =3.

Simplify:

(198 gamma1 -198 gamma1) + (-198 +200.9997) )=3.

So,

0 + (2.9997) =3.

Which is approximately 3=3.

Hmm, so this doesn't give any new information. It's just confirming the equation.

So, perhaps I need another equation, maybe involving the velocity relation.

Wait, perhaps the kinetic energy can be related to the velocity via the relativistic kinetic energy formula.

T = (gamma -1) m c².

And gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But without knowing v, it's difficult.

Alternative approach: Maybe the non-relativistic assumption is that T is (1/2)mv², but in reality, the KE is higher because of the gamma factor.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV, but the actual T1 could be higher.

Wait, but considering that the sum is 3 GeV, and the fragments have different masses, the actual T1 is perhaps higher than 1 GeV.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the relativistic approach would give a lower T1 than the classical one.

Wait, no. Let's think about kinetic energy in a different way.

In non-relativistic, T = (1/2) m v^2.

In relativistic, T = (gamma -1) m c².

Which is larger? At high velocities, gamma becomes greater than 1, so T is larger than (1/2) m v^2.

Wait, for high velocities, but when v is close to c, the relativistic KE is much larger.

Wait, but in our case, the velocities aren't that high. The kinetic energy is only 3 GeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass energies.

Wait, the rest mass energy of the fragments is 198 GeV and 99 GeV. So their KE is about 1.5% of the rest mass energy.

Hmm. So, (3 GeV)/(300 GeV) = 1% of the initial energy.

So, the velocities might be low, meaning that relativistic effects are small.

Therefore, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 would be small.

So, perhaps the correct T1 is a little higher than the classical value of 1 GeV, but not by much.

But wait, the question is about the difference between correct and classical. So, if the correct is higher, the difference would be positive, and if lower, negative.

But let's see.

In non-relativistic, T1 is 1 GeV.

In reality, since the KE is (gamma-1) m c², which is higher than (1/2) m v² when v is significant, but when v is small, the two are similar.

But without knowing v, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is small, but the question is about which option is correct.

Wait, the options given are A) 2 MeV, B)5, etc.

Hmm, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So, if the actual T1 is a bit higher, the difference would be in the range of a few MeV. So perhaps the correct answer is a few MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct T1 is lower than the classical value. Let's think.

Wait, non-relativistically, T1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

In reality, the KE is (gamma-1) m1 c².

Hmm, but how do these compare?

Assume that v is small, so gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So, T_rel ≈ (v²)/(2 c²) * m1 c² = (1/2) m1 v² = T_classical.

So, perhaps at low velocities, the relativistic KE is approximately the same as classical.

But how about when considering the momentum? Because in the relativistic case, the momentum is gamma m v.

In the non-relativistic case, we have the momentum as m v.

So, in the non-relativistic case, we have m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But in the relativistic case, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since the masses are in a 2:1 ratio, but the gammas might not be 1, the velocities might be different.

Wait, but if velocities are small, gamma is close to 1, so the non-relativistic approximation holds, and the velocities are similar.

So, in the non-relativistic case, v1 = (m2/m1) v2 = (1/2) v2.

So, the more massive fragment moves slower.

In the relativistic case, perhaps the more massive fragment's velocity is a bit higher than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, because gamma1 is (slightly) greater than 1, and gamma2 is also greater than 1.

Wait, but since the more massive fragment is heavier, if the velocity is lower, gamma would be closer to 1.

Hmm, perhaps the more massive fragment's velocity is lower, so its gamma is closer to 1.

Wait, let's make an assumption. Let's suppose that the non-relativistic approach gives v1 and v2 as in the previous calculation, and the relativistic approach would have similar velocities, but with a tiny gamma factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual KE is a bit higher.

Wait, but without knowing the actual velocities, it's hard to proceed.

Another approach: Let's compute the classical T1 and then compute the relativistic T1 using the fact that the sum of KEs is 3 GeV.

Wait, but that doesn't directly give T1; it gives the sum.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the velocities in the non-relativistic case and then see how much the relativistic calculation would change the KE.

In the non-relativistic case, v1 = (m2/(m1)) v2.

Wait, earlier we had: m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v1 = (m2/m1) v2.

Since m1 =2 m2, v1 = (1/2) v2.

So, in non-relativistic case, v1 is (1/2) v2.

So, let's compute v1 and v2.

The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic case, T1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2m2)(v1²) = m2 v1².

T2= (1/2) m2 v2².

But v2 =2 v1, so T2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) )= 2 m2 v1².

So sum is m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² =3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So, m2 v1² =1 GeV.

So, m2 v1²=1 GeV.

So, T1_classical =1 GeV.

But in reality, the KE is (gamma-1) m1 c².

So, the actual KE for the more massive fragment is T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 -1)*99 GeV.

And T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

We have from earlier:

gamma1 and gamma2 are just slightly above 1.

But without knowing their exact values, perhaps we can find the difference between T1_classical and T1_relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the difference is T1_classical - T1_relativistic.

Because in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV, but in reality, it's higher or lower?

Wait, in the KE formula, if the velocity is the same, the relativistic KE is higher than the non-relativistic.

But the velocities might be different.

Hmm.

An alternative approach: Let's consider that in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is T1_classical = 1 GeV.

But in reality, the kinetic energy T1 is (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

So, the difference is (1 GeV) - [ (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV ].

Wait, but I don't know gamma1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express gamma1 in terms of the velocity.

But I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps using the conservation of momentum.

In the non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But in the relativistic case, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

So,

gamma1 *2m *v1 = gamma2 *m *v2.

So,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

In non-relativistic case, v2 = 2 v1.

So, substituting into the relativistic equation:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (2 v1).

Divide both sides by 2 v1:

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, in the non-relativistic limit, gamma1 = gamma2.

But that's only when v is small, so gamma is approximately 1.

But if velocities are small, then gamma is approx 1, so gamma1 ≈ gamma2.

So, from equation (1a), 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303.

If gamma1 ≈ gamma2, then 3 gamma1 ≈3.0303 →gamma1≈1.0101.

So, gamma1=1.0101, gamma2=1.0101.

So, T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV = (0.0101) *198 ≈2 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because the sum is only 3 GeV.

Wait, if gamma1 and gamma2 are both 1.0101, then:

T1 = (0.0101)*198 ≈2 GeV.

T2= (0.0101)*99 ≈1 GeV.

Sum ≈3 GeV, which fits.

But in the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV and T2 2 GeV.

So, in the relativistic case, T1 is 2 GeV, which is higher than the non-relativistic case.

So, the difference between correct T1 and non-relativistic T1 is 2 GeV -1 GeV =1 GeV=1000 MeV.

But the options are in MeV, and the choices are 2,5,10,20 MeV.

Hmm, that suggests that my assumption is wrong because I can't get into the MeV range.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the velocities are not so small.

Wait, but the initial energy released is 3 GeV, which is 1% of the initial rest mass, so maybe the velocities are small.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternative approach:

Assume that the velocities are non-relativistic, so the kinetic energies are calculated classically: T1=1 GeV.

But the actual kinetic energies are relativistic.

Wait, but how? Maybe I can compute the correction.

The difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 is the value we need.

But without knowing the actual T1, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the velocities using the relativistic equations.

But this will involve a lot of algebra.

Let me proceed step by step.

Given:

m1 =2m, m2 =m.

Sum of rest masses:3m=0.99 M → m=0.33 M.

Total initial energy:300 GeV.

Total rest energy after split:297 GeV.

Kinetic energy:3 GeV.

We need to find T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

We can write two equations:

Equation1: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Equation2: (gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² =3 GeV.

We can write equation2 as:

198 (gamma1 -1) +99 (gamma2 -1) =3 →198 gamma1 +99 gamma2 =300.

Equation3: 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But we have three variables: gamma1, gamma2, v1, v2.

But since the system is in one dimension, perhaps we can relate the velocities.

But perhaps another equation comes from the fact that the velocity of each fragment can be expressed in terms of gamma.

v = c sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So, v1 = c sqrt(1 -1/gamma1^2).

v2 =c sqrt(1 -1/gamma2^2).

Substituting into equation3:

2 gamma1 * c sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2 * c sqrt(1 -1/gamma2²).

We can divide both sides by c:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma2²).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

→4 gamma1² (1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2² (1 -1/gamma2²).

Simplify left side:

4 gamma1² ( (gamma1² -1)/gamma1² )=4 (gamma1² -1).

Right side:

gamma2² ( (gamma2² -1)/gamma2² )= gamma2² -1.

So,

4 (gamma1² -1 )= gamma2² -1.

→4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1.

→gamma2² =4 gamma1² -3.

Now, from equation1a: 2 gamma1 + gamma2=3.0303.

Let me write gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substitute into gamma2² =4 gamma1^2 -3.

So,

(3.0303 -2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Expanding the left side:

(3.0303)^2 - 2*3.0303 *2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Compute (3.0303)^2: approx 9.18.

So,

9.18 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Simplify:

9.18 -12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1^2 -4 gamma1^2 +3=0.

→12.1212 -12.1212 gamma1 =0.

So,

12.1212 (1 -gamma1 )=0.

So, either 12.1212=0 (impossible) or 1 - gamma1=0 →gamma1=1.

But gamma1 can't be 1 because that would mean the fragment is at rest, which is impossible.

Wait, that suggests that the assumption leads to a contradiction. Which means perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps.

From equation3 after squaring:

4 (gamma1^2 -1 ) = gamma2^2 -1.

So,

4 gamma1^2 -4 = gamma2^2 -1.

Which gives,

gamma2^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Then, from equation1a,

gamma2 =3.0303 -2 gamma1.

So,

gamma2^2 = (3.0303 -2 gamma1)^2.

Expanding:

= (3.0303)^2 - 2*3.0303 *2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2.

=9.1818 -12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1^2.

So,

4 gamma1^2 -3 =9.1818 -12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1^2.

Subtract 4 gamma1^2 from both sides:

-3 =9.1818 -12.1212 gamma1.

Bring 9.1818 to the left:

-3 -9.1818 = -12.1212 gamma1.

→-12.1818 = -12.1212 gamma1.

Divide both sides by -12.1212:

gamma1 = 12.1818 /12.1212 ≈1.005.

So, gamma1≈1.005.

Then, gamma2 =3.0303 -2*1.005 =3.0303-2.01=1.0203.

So, gamma1≈1.005 and gamma2≈1.0203.

Now, compute T1 and T2.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

gamma1 -1 =0.005.

So, T1=0.005 *198 =0.99 GeV =990 MeV.

T2=(gamma2 -1)*99 GeV.

gamma2 -1=0.0203.

So, T2=0.0203 *99 ≈2 GeV.

Wait, but 0.0203 *99 is about 2 GeV? Wait, 0.02 *99=1.98 GeV. So, T2≈1.98 GeV.

But T1 + T2 should be 3 GeV.

0.99 +1.98=2.97 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV.

So, the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

Classical T1 is 1 GeV.

Relativistic T1 is approximately 0.99 GeV.

Wait, that's a difference of about -0.01 GeV, or -10 MeV.

But wait, the options are positive differences. Hmm.

Wait, the question is, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1?

So, correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, and classical is 1 GeV.

Difference is 0.99 -1 = -0.01 GeV, which is -10 MeV.

But the question says, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1.

So, perhaps the correct value is 0.99 GeV; the classical is 1 GeV.

So, the correct T1 is lower than the classical by 10 MeV.

But wait, the options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

So, option C is 10 MeV.

So, the difference is 10 MeV. But wait, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV. The classical is 1 GeV, which is 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 10 MeV. The correct is lower by 10 MeV.

But the question says, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1? So, correct - classical = -10 MeV.

But the options don't have negative values. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, the difference is 10 MeV.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 2 MeV.

B)5 MeV.

C)10 MeV.

D)20 MeV.

So, the correct answer would be C)10 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Rest Mass Energy**: The nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.
2. **Mass Distribution After Fission**: The nucleus splits into two fragments where the more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the lighter one. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, i.e., 297 GeV.
3. **Energy Released**: The total energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the sum of the rest masses of the fragments:  
   \[
   \text{Energy Released} = 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   This energy is entirely converted into the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

4. **Masses of Fragments**:  
   Let the masses of the two fragments be \(m_1\) (more massive) and \(m_2\) (less massive). Using the given mass ratio (\(m_1 = 2m_2\)) and the total mass (\(m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M\)), we find:  
   \[
   m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
   \]
   The rest mass energies are:  
   \[
   m_1c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV}, \quad m_2c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

5. **Kinetic Energy Distribution**: The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Using conservation of momentum and energy, the relativistic kinetic energies of the fragments are calculated. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).

### Non-Relativistic Case:
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by:  
\[
T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
\]
From conservation of momentum (\(m_1v_1 = m_2v_2\)) and the total kinetic energy (\(T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}\)), the non-relativistic kinetic energies are:  
\[
T_{1,\text{classical}} = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_{2,\text{classical}} = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Case:
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energies are calculated using the relativistic formula. The total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV, but the distribution differs slightly due to relativistic effects. Solving for the relativistic kinetic energies, we find:  
\[
T_{1,\text{relativistic}} \approx 0.99 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_{2,\text{relativistic}} \approx 2.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energies:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the non-relativistic value is:  
\[
\Delta T_1 = T_{1,\text{relativistic}} - T_{1,\text{classical}} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = -0.01 \, \text{GeV} = -10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Taking the absolute value, the difference is **10 MeV**.

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the non-relativistic approximation for the more massive fragment is **10 MeV**.
