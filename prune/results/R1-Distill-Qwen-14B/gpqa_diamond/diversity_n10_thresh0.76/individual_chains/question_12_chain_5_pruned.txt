Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The process is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and I need to find the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy must be conserved. The pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. Oh, but the neutrino's mass is negligible, I think. So maybe I can treat it as zero.

So the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum of the products must also be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_π c². Since it's at rest, there's no kinetic energy. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy would be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

Wait, but the neutrino is a lepton, and it's a product here. So let's denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. So E_mu + E_nu = m_π c².

But also, since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta should be equal. Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, so the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction.

For the muon: its energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy E_nu is just p c, because its rest mass is zero.

So putting it all together, E_mu + E_nu = m_π c². Substituting E_mu and E_nu gives:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_π c².

Hmm, let's simplify this equation by dividing both sides by c² to make it easier. Let me set x = p c, so the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (m_mu)^2 ) + x = m_π.

Wait, actually, m_mu and m_π are given in MeV/c², right? So when I calculate m_mu c², it's 105.7 MeV, and m_π c² is 139.6 MeV. So the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

I can subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Now compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

139.6 squared: let's calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7 squared: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is ~32.49, and cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + (5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So putting the numbers in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Wait, because 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So,

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Let me compute that: 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So,

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 is approximately 280. 8315.67 / 280 ≈ 29.7 (since 280*29=8120, 280*30=8400. So 29.7 is close).

Wait, precise calculation:

279.2 * x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 → 8376 -279.2 = 8096.8.

That's lower than 8315.67. 29.7 → 279.2 *29.7 = let's compute 279.2*(29 +0.7)=279.2*29 + 279.2*0.7.

279.2 *29: 279 *29 = (200*29) + (79*29)= 5800 + 2291= 8091. Then 0.2*29=5.8 → 8091 +5.8=8096.8.

279.2 *0.7= (279 *0.7) + (0.2 *0.7). 279 *0.7=195.3; 0.2*0.7=0.14. So 195.44.

So total 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24.

Hmm, but that's 279.2 *29.7=8292.24. But the numerator is 8315.67, which is 23.43 higher. So 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So x ≈29.784 → about 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait
