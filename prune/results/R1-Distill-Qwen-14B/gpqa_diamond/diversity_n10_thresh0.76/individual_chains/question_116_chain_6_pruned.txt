Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

First, let's look at the problem. Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting patterns can give information about neighboring protons. A triplet suggests each proton has two neighboring Hs, like maybe adjacent to a CH2 group. The quartet would be four neighboring Hs, which could be a CH2 next to another CH2, maybe in a chain.

Wait, 0.9 ppm is usually around where methyl groups (CH3) attached to something else, like a CH2, appear. The triplet for 6H—so that's two sets of 3H each. Maybe two methyl groups, each next to another CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—so maybe a CH2 next to another CH2 group. Like maybe ethyl groups. So putting it together, maybe a diethyl ether structure? Or perhaps a cyclopropane derivative? No, cyclopropane would have different shifts.

Wait, another thought: if it's a diethyl group, like two ethyl groups attached somewhere. Wait, diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be a triplet if next to a CH2. Oh, right! The ethyl group's CH3 is a triplet because the adjacent CH2 has two Hs. And the CH2 would be a quartet because each of its Hs is next to another CH2 with two Hs. So for diethyl ether, the CH2 would be a quartet, but wait, in diethyl ether, each CH2 is next to another CH2 in the adjacent ethyl group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the NMR shows 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. Let me think about the splitting. For the triplet (6H), each group has 3 H, and each is next to a group with 2 H. So like two -CH2CH3 groups, where the CH3 is next to CH2. So the triplet would be for the CH3 groups, each 3H,
