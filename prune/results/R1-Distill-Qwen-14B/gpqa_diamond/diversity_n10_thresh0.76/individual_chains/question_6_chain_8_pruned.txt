Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem states that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, the potential and the Hamiltonian can sometimes be broken down into parts that resemble one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. Oh wait, because the potential might be separable into radial and angular parts, right?

So the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me see if I can factor this or separate the terms. Let's factor out kr²:

V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]

Hmm, the first term is (1/2) kr², which looks like a standard harmonic oscillator potential in r. The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me rewrite the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2
= (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ)
= (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ
= (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ

Wait, but that might not be the most useful approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the potential as a sum of two parts: the radial part and a term that depends on θ.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum operator or something. Wait, the angular part might relate to the angular momentum. Because in 2D polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian includes the angular momentum term.

Wait, the general form of the Hamiltonian in 2D polar coordinates is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). Right? So p_r is the radial momentum, and p_theta is the angular momentum L.

So the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me see if I can factor this further. Let's factor kr² outside:

V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]

Wait, (3/2) cos²θ can be written as (3/4)(1 + cos2θ), using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting:

V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2)*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) ]
= kr² [ (1/2) + (3/4) +
