Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think is Li-6 because lithium has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Oh wait, no, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons? Wait, no, regular lithium is Li-7, but the isotope with 3 neutrons would be Li-3? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the atomic number is 3 (Li), so mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the nucleus is Li and has 3 neutrons. So number of protons is 3 because it's Li. Neutrons are 3, so mass number A is 3+3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Right, so the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

So the problem is about finding the energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c. So relativistic mechanics, right. I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait,
