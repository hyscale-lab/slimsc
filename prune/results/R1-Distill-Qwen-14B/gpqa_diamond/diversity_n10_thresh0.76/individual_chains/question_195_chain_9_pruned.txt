Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. It's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it exhibits both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the second planet also has a circular orbit.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to recall what transit and occultation events mean. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, and we lose the planet's light (if it's reflecting or emitting). For both events to happen, the planet's orbital plane must be edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. But wait, the problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, so maybe that's already set up.

But wait, actually, both transiting and occultation events require that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes in front of and behind the star. So it's about the inclination of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the maximum inclination where a transit occurs is when the orbit is edge-on, i.e., inclination i = 90 degrees. But for both transit and occultation to occur, the planet must pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star.

Wait, actually, when a planet transits, it's moving in front of the star. For occultation, the planet must be behind the star. So the orbital plane's orientation must be such that the planet passes both in front and behind. That probably means that the inclination is exactly 90 degrees, edge-on. Because if it's more than 90, it would be a retrograde orbit, but perhaps that doesn't change the main point here.

So, the key here is that the second planet must be in an orbit that's also edge-on, just like the first one, so that both events can occur. But the question is about the maximum orbital period. So, probably, the maximum period would be determined by some other constraint, perhaps the Hill sphere or the habitable zone? Wait, no, the question is about the orbital period that allows both transit and occultation, so maybe it's about the alignment of their orbits. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem is about two planets in the same system. The first planet transits, which gives us some information about the system. The second planet must also transit and be occulted, so both events are possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the orbital periods and the timing of transits. For both planets to cause events (transit and occultation), their orbital periods must be such that their transits are timed correctly. But wait, the question is about the maximum period for the second planet. So perhaps the maximum period is
