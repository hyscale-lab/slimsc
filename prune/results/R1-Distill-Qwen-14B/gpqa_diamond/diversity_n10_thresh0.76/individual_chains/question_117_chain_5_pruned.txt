Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is about whether a compound can have enantiomers, meaning they are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. That usually requires the presence of a chiral center, right? A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl groups can sometimes have stereoisomerism if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, so the biphenyl part has two nitro groups on each phenyl ring, at the 6 positions, and the two methyl esters on the 2 positions. Oh, but wait, biphenyls can have another kind of isomerism called geometric isomerism or maybe even conformational? Or perhaps because of the substituents, they can have a plane of symmetry? Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then maybe it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then yes. Hmmm. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is on the same side or opposite, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the substituents. Each phenyl ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. So for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, for biphenyl, the positions are on adjacent rings. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, then the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical, like if the substituents are mirrored on both rings, then it might not be chiral. So in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are those positions on both rings such that the molecule is symmetrical? Let me visualize. If each ring has 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate, then looking from the biphenyl axis, the arrangement might be symmetric. Wait, but for biphenyl groups, the substituents can be on either the same or opposite sides, which is called para or meta perhaps. But I'm not sure if that leads to optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. Hmm, perhaps, but I'm not too certain. Maybe I should mark this as possibly having optical isomerism and come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure here is CH3-C(OH)O-COOCH3. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-. So when you make the methyl ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon with the OH is the second carbon. So that carbon is connected to: a) CH3, b) COOCH3, c) OH, d) and since it's a CH, another H? So that would be four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that's a chiral center. So yes, this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So number 2 is positive.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone (C=O) group. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one O,
