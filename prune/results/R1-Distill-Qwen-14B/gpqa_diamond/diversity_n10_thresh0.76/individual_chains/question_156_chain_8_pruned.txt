Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard and chiral.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry of the reaction matters. Since mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent, the epoxidation typically proceeds with some stereochemical outcome.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, how does the epoxidation work? Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry. The reaction is stereospecific. In a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, creating a trans epoxide. For a cis (Z) double bond, the epoxide will have the oxygens on the same side, making a cis epoxide. Or wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again.

No, wait. The epoxidation of a cis double bond would form a trans epoxide because the peracid adds to each carbon from the same face (since peracid adds in a concerted way with the same stereochemistry). So, if the starting alkene is Z (cis), the epoxide would have the oxygen on adjacent carbons but in a trans configuration because the peracid adds from the same face. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxidation leads to an epoxide where the sterechemistry is determined by the original alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be formed with a certain configuration, and similarly for (Z). Alternatively, wait, mCPBA can cause epoxidation in a way that preserves the stereochemistry. So, if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide. For Z, the
