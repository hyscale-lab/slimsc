Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give me choices for both the relative speed and the total energy. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed part. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their velocities because you have to consider the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different from the classical case.

The formula for the relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to each other is given by:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the frame of references. Let me think again. If the two astronauts are moving at velocities v1 and v2 in the same direction (both positive x), then from the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), the second (3m) is moving at what speed?

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the relative speed as observed from one of them, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, the question says "relative speed", which I think is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So, for example, what's the speed of the 3m astronaut as seen from the 2m astronaut's frame?

So, let's say astronaut A is the 2m one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is the 3m one moving at 0.5c. Both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B is moving at v = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be ( -0.1c ) / (1 - 0.3 c² / c² ) = (-0.1c) / (0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. But speed is positive, so 0.
