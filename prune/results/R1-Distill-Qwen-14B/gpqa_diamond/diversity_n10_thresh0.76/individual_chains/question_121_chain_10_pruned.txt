Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the reaction of a specific epoxide with an organocuprate. I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically add to epoxides in a certain way.

The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane has two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered bridge. The 7-oxa part means there's an oxygen in the bridge, so it's an epoxide.

So, the structure would have an epoxide ring (the oxygen connects two carbons in the bridge). The substituents are methyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 4. Let me draw that. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but I think the key is to understand where the attack will happen.

When an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile like an organocuprate (Me2CuLi), the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon. Wait, but in disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. Oh right, because the nucle
