Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant. Wait, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So when I need to compute the density matrix rho, I'll have to square this state, right? Because the density matrix is |psi><psi|.

The non-Gaussianity is being measured using relative entropy, del_b. The formula is given as trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So non-Gaussian states have higher del_b, I think.

Wait, but wait. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called the quantum relative entropy) is used to quantify how non-Gaussian a state is. So if the state is Gaussian, del_b would be zero because rho equals tau, so their logs would be same, and their traces subtracted would be zero.

But in this case, the state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, I think. So the answer can't be D) 0, unless there
