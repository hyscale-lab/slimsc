Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up in the mice. Hmm, let's break it down.

So, the setup is that there's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. They want to see their developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with some specific structure details. 

The vector they're using is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element. 

Wait, IRES elements are internal ribosome entry sites, right? So they allow for the translation of the downstream ORF without the need for a second ribosome binding site. So the ligand would be expressed first, then the receptor under the same promoter. But there are stop cassettes in between the ligand and mCherry, and another between receptor and eGFP. Those are loxP and lox2272 stops. 

They used Cre to knockout these stops. Oh right, because loxP is recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 cassette would be excised by Cre, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. 

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is first, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. Then the IRES, then receptor, then stop in lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed with the stop, so mCherry wouldn't be expressed. Similarly, the receptor can't be expressed without the Cre excising the lox2272 stop.

But in this case, the vector is lox-Cre, so Cre is present. So when the plasmid is transfected, the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing both ligand and mCherry to be expressed, and receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

They do a Western blot and see expression, using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So the initial tests probably worked, meaning the ligand and receptor are being expressed, right?

But when they breed the mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, then the offspring don't show green signal under confocal, which is for eGFP.

So why isn't eGFP being expressed in the offspring? Let's think about the construct.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for
