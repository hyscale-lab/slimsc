Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember for the classical case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Oh right, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem so I can't just use the classical formula.

Relativistically, the energy considerations are different. The total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma m c squared. And the potential energy of the oscillator is still (1/2)kA²? Or wait, no, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? I think the spring force is still F = -kx, so the potential energy would be the same (1/2)kx², but when x is A, that's the maximum potential energy.

At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the rest mass energy is mc², right? So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic. But in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) mc². So E = K + mc². So E = gamma mc².

So setting E = mc² + (1/2)kA² equal to gamma mc². That gives:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²)

Wait, wait, let me write that correctly. (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc
