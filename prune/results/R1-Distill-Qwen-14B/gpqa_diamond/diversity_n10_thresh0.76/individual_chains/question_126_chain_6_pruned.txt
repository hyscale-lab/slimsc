Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two reactions being performed by an organic chemist. I need to figure out how many peaks will show up when the products are run on different HPLC columns. Hmm.

Let me start by looking at each reaction separately.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, so LAH would reduce that to an alcohol. The structure is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Wait, wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at position 3. The molecule is CH3-C-OCH3 attached to the chain? Or maybe I should draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: The carbon chain is six carbons long. The ketone is on C3. Then, on C5, there's a methoxy group (-OCH3). So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-?

Wait, maybe I should number it correctly. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? But with a methoxy on C5. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait the structure of hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe it's (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? Let me get that right.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, not sure, but the main point is that when LAH reduces the ketone, the carbonyl becomes a CHOH group.

So LAH would convert the ketone into a secondary alcohol. Since the starting material is an S configuration, the product would have the same configuration? Or would it change because of the reduction? Wait, LAH typically does a ketone to secondary
