Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a series of reactions. Let's start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about possible structures. Since there's a nitro group (NO), maybe the compound has a nitro substituent. Or wait, the NMR data might help more.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two neighboring protons.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. The doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another aromatic set. If these are also para, then perhaps two substituents on benzene rings.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like adjacent to an oxygen (OH group?), but since it's a singlet, maybe they're nonequivalent but not split. Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like in a vinyl group.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. This could be CH2 groups next to an electronegative atom, maybe next to an oxygen. Or perhaps part of an ethyl group adjacent to something else.

Putting this together: Maybe the structure is something like a phenyl group attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde and some other substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So 5 degrees: one for each ring (maybe two benzene rings?), but wait, benzene is 3 degrees each. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me see:

Wait, perhaps it's a single benzene ring with substituents. Let me think about the possible structure.

Alternatively, considering the 1H NMR:

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) must be an aldehyde. So the compound has an aldehyde group.

Looking at the other peaks, the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 each have 2H. Maybe that's two para-substituted benzene rings. So, perhaps the compound is a diaryl aldehyde. Wait, diaryl aldehydes have two aromatic rings attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but
