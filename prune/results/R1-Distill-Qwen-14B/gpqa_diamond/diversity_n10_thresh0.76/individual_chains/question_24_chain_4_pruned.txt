Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives hydrocarbon Z, which is a solvent and has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Also, Z is part of mixture Y and doesn't react further with hydrogen. Plus, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to figure out what Z is. Since Z is a hydrocarbon, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given as 14.28%. Let me calculate its molecular formula.

Mass fraction of H is 14.28% which is approximately 1/7. So, if the molecule is CnHm, the hydrogen percentage is (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7. Let me compute that.

Let me set up the equation: (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's the general formula for alkenes. Wait, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon that comes from hydrogenation of Y and X. Also, Z doesn't react further with H2, meaning it's saturated, so probably an alkane.

Wait, wait, wait. Because if Z is formed by hydrogenation, then it's the fully hydrogenated product. So perhaps Z is an alkane. Let me check the formula again. If Z is an alkane, the formula would be CnH2n+2.

Wait, but earlier I got CnH2n. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% which is 1/7. So (mass of H) / (mass of molecule) = 1/7.

So H mass is m*1, and the molecule's molar mass is 12n + m. So:

m / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m=2n.

So m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. For example, ethylene is C2H4, which fits. But wait, ethylene is an alkene. But Z comes from hydrogenation, which would add H2 across double bonds. So Z must be an alkane.

Wait, if Z is an alkane, then its formula should be CnH2n+2. So if the hydrogen fraction is 14.28%, let's compute for that.

Suppose the formula is CnH2n+2. Total mass is 12n + (2n+2) =1
