Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. When monochromatic light hits this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) is approximately theta.

Hmm. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles determined by the slit width and the wavelength. But wait, this isn't a single slit; it's a polygon with many sides. Oh, but if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. The question says it's a polygon with all apothems equal. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So if all apothems are same length a, and N is large, the shape becomes a circle of radius a. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex) as a = R * cos(π/N). So when N is very large, π/N is very small, and cos(π/N) ≈ 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius becomes a, making the aperture effectively a circle with radius a.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the side length and the radius. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem would be the radius of that circle. So, yes, the effective radius is a.

So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture. I think that for a single slit (which is a different scenario, but for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different), but wait, in the far field, which is the Fraunhofer diffraction, I think for a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles.

Wait,
