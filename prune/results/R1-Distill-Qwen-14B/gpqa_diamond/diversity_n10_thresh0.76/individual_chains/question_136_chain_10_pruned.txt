Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude of f(r) is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, right, the divergence of a vector field. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much the field is expanding or contracting at a given point. So, the integral of the divergence over a volume is like adding up all that expansion or contraction throughout the volume.

Oh, wait—there's also the Divergence Theorem to consider. The Divergence Theorem relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the volume integral of its divergence. Mathematically, it says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface enclosing V. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

Hmm, that might be useful here because calculating the divergence of f might be tricky, especially in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the flux directly through the surface of the sphere and see what happens.

Wait, the field f has only a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) would have components (f_r, 0, 0). Since f_r = 1/r², and it's directed radially outward, I think. So, the vector field is radially outward with magnitude 1/r².

Let me think about the flux of f through a sphere of radius R. The flux Φ is the integral over the surface of f · dA. Since f is radial, and dA is also radial (because the surface is a sphere), the dot product simplifies to f_r multiplied by the area element.

So, Φ = ∫∫ f · dA = ∫∫ f_r * (r² sinθ dθ dφ) ) evaluated at r = R. Because on the surface, r is R. So f_r at r=R is 1/(R²).

So Φ = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, because dA for a sphere is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So when I multiply f_r (which is 1/R²) by R² sinθ dθ dφ, the R² cancels out.

So Φ becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to π) ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) sinθ dφ dθ. Let's compute that. The integral over φ is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dφ = 2π. The integral over θ is ∫0 to π sinθ dθ = 2. So Φ = 2π * 2 = 4π.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no: Φ
