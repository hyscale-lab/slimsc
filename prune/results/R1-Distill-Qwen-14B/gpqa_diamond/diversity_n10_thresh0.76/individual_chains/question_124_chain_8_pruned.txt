Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and process what it's asking.

So, the setup is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead of one third. The options are given as A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm. I think I remember that the Lorentz factor affects time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are fast-decaying, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. The longer the lifetime, the farther they can travel before decaying, so more of them would reach the detector walls.

Wait, but the problem says that with a Lorentz factor of ~20, only one third reach the walls. So, I need to find the Lorentz factor that would get two-thirds to reach.

I think the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles versus the dilated lifetime. Let's denote the proper lifetime as τ (tau). In the particle's rest frame, it decays after time τ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma times τ, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So, the distance a particle can travel before decaying depends on its speed and the dilated lifetime. The speed is approximately the speed of light since they are ultra-relativistic. So, the maximum distance L is v multiplied by the lifetime. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * gamma * τ.

But wait, the distance they need to cover is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. So, L must be equal to or greater than 30 meters for the particle to reach the wall.

Wait, but the problem says that when gamma is 20, only one third reach the walls. So maybe the average distance they travel isn't enough for some of them. Hmm, perhaps it's a probability issue. The
