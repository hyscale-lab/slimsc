Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question says. Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to choose the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

First, I'll start by looking at the FTIR data. The question states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. A strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, wait. Wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl typically absorbs around 1700, but sometimes it can be a bit lower. Also, the broad peak around 3000 would make sense for an O-H stretch because carboxylic acids have strong -OH groups that absorb in the broad region. So this might suggest that the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH except option C, which ends with CH2COOH. Wait, no, option C is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So that's a CH2 group attached to COOH. So that's a secondary or tertiary structure, but regardless, they all have a COOH group. Let me check each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's a CH2COOH group, meaning the carboxylic acid is at the end. The rest is a branched structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So here, the COOH is attached to a CH group which is connected to CH2CH3 and C2H5 groups? Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the formula: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central part is a carbon connected to another carbon, each of those Cs is connected to a CH2CH3 (ethyl) group and a hydrogen. So, it's like a geminal diethyl group, with COOH on one
