Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax angle. Oh right, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is closer than one with 0.5 parsecs.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly probably means that the same number density of stars exists throughout space. So, the number of stars in a region doesn't depend on where you are in the universe, just on the volume.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, they're asking how the density of stars in the parallax space behaves. Parallax (p) is related to distance d by p = 1/d. So, if I consider a small range of parallaxes, say from p to p + dp, what's the number of stars in that range?

I remember that in a uniform distribution, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume itself. Let's think about this.

If I imagine a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell would be 4πd² dr. Because a sphere's surface area is 4πd², and dr is the thickness. Since the number density is n (number per unit volume), the number of stars would be n * 4πd² dr.

But since p = 1/d, we can express d as 1/p. So, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because dr = derivative of (1/p) with respect to p. Oh wait, d = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. Hmm, so substituting, the number of stars N in a parallax range dp would be:

N = n * 4π ( (1/p)^2 )^2 * (-(1/p²) dp) ) ?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. The volume element in spherical coordinates at a distance d is 4πd² dr. So, for a shell between d and d
