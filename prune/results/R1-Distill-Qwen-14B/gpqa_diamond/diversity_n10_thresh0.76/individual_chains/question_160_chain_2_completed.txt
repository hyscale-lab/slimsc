Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm. I remember something about diffraction patterns and apertures from my optics class.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture. But wait, I thought the question is about the minima in the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by rings of dark and light areas. The first minima around the central maximum are important here.

I think the formula for the minima in a single-slit diffraction is given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But wait, that's for a single slit. Oh, but here we're dealing with a circular aperture, which would use Bessel functions for the diffraction pattern. The minima of the Bessel functions determine the dark rings. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, right?

The first minimum for the circular aperture, I think, happens when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait a second, the minima for the Bessel function J_m occur at specific points. For the zeroth order (m=0), the first minimum is at a certain value. Or maybe I'm mixing up the orders. Oh wait, no, actually the central maximum is the brightest, and the first minima around it are for higher orders. Wait, for a circular aperture, the first dark ring (the first minimum) occurs when the Bessel function J1(k a sinθ) has its first zero. So J1(x) = 0 when x is approximately 3.8317. So the condition is (π a sinθ)/λ = 3.8317, solving for θ.

Wait, no, the general formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by aθ ≈ mλ, where m is an integer, but I might be mixing up the terms. Wait, let's think again. The far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy pattern. The minima occur where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first minima after the central maximum is the first dark ring. The formula for that is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (a), right? Because the first zero of J1 is around 3.8317, so 3.8317/(pi) ≈ 1.22.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula is a sinθ = (mλ), but wait, for circular apertures, the formula for the minima is a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, no, wait maybe that's for something else. No, wait, the minima in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture occur at angles where the Bessel function J1(k a sinθ) is zero. The zeros of J1 are at 3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum is at a sinθ = λ * (3.8317)/(pi). Let me calculate that.

3.8317 divided by π is approximately 1.22. So a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So θ = arcsin(1.22 λ / a). But since the angles are small, we can approximate sinθ ≈ θ (in radians). So θ ≈ (1.22 λ) / a. Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait wait, no. The first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second would be the next one. But wait, in the Airy pattern, the minima occur at angles where a sinθ = 3.8317 λ/(pi), 7.0156 λ/(pi), etc. So the first minimum is at 3.8317/(pi) ≈1.22, the second at 7.0156/(pi) ≈2.23, and so on.

So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the difference between the angles corresponding to m=1 and m=2 (or whatever the indices are). Let me think: the first minimum is at m=1 (since m starts at 0 for the central maximum), but wait, in the circular case, the minima occur at a sinθ = (x_m) λ, where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the first minimum is at x_1=3.8317, the second at x_2=7.0156. So the angles are θ1= (x_1 λ)/(a) and θ2= (x_2 λ)/(a), assuming small angles. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = (x_2 - x_1) λ/(a).

x_2 is 7.0156, x_1 is 3.8317, so subtracting gives about 3.1839. Hmm, 3.1839/(pi) is approximately 1.013, so 3.1839 λ/(a) is the angular distance. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 0.610 λ /a

B) 0.500 λ /a

C) 1.220 λ /a

D) 0.506 λ /a

Wait, none of these is around 3.18. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says that the polygon's apothems are all of same length a. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) by a = R cos(π/N). But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem becomes the radius of the circle. So when N is infinitely large, the apothem a is the radius of the circular aperture.

Wait, but in the case of a circular aperture, the formula for the minima is θ = (x * λ)/(a), where x is the zeros of J1. So the first minimum is at x=3.8317, so θ1=3.8317 λ/(a pi) = 1.22 λ/a. The second minimum would be θ2=7.0156 λ/(a pi) ≈ (7.0156/3.1416)=2.236 λ/a. Wait, 7.0156 divided by π is approximately 2.236. So the angular separation between the first two minima is (theta2 - theta1) = (2.236 - 1.22) λ/a ≈1.016 λ/a. But that's not among the options.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking about the positions of the first two minima, which would be at m=1 and m=2 in terms of the orders of diffraction. But in the circular case, the minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function, so the angle for each minimum is theta_m = (x_m * lambda)/(pi * a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So the first minimum is at theta1 = 3.8317 * lambda/(pi a) ≈1.22 lambda/a, and the second is theta2 =7.0156 * lambda/(pi a) ≈2.23 lambda/a.

So the angular distance is theta2 - theta1 = (7.0156 -3.8317)/pi * lambda/a = (3.1839)/pi ≈1.013 lambda/a. But none of the options match this, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, another thought. The problem mentions an N-sided polygon, and when N is infinitely large, it's a circle. But perhaps the problem is actually about a different setup. Wait, the apothems are all length a. So the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of each side. For a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). When N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈a. So the radius is a. So the radius of the circular aperture is a.

Wait, but in the Airy disk formula, the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 lambda/(a), right? So that's option C: 1.220 λ/a. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's not the first and second minima, but the first and second minima after the central maximum. But the angular distance between the first and second minima would be 1.013 λ/a, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a, which matches the first minimum. But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So I'm getting confused. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the polygon's diffraction pattern, not a circular one. But when N approaches infinity, the polygon is a circle. So that shouldn't change the conclusion.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. The problem says all apothems are the same length a. So the polygon is regular and each side is at a distance a from the center. When N is large, the polygon approximates a circle, so the effective radius is a, as discussed.

In the far field, the diffraction pattern is determined by the Fraunhofer diffraction. For a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, but for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where the Bessel function J1(k a sinθ) is zero. The first minimum is at about 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima. That suggests the positions of the first and second minima, which are at 1.22 and 2.23 radians (if a=1 and lambda=1), but their difference is about 1.01. Hmm, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the first minimum after the central maximum and the first minimum on the other side, but that would still be the same angular distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as an approximation to a circular aperture, but perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the diffraction pattern is derived for a polygon. For a regular polygon, the diffraction pattern involves the product of the Fourier transforms of the polygon's edges. But when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction should approach the circular case.

Wait, but the problem is stated as for an N-sided polygon with all apothems a, which becomes a circle when N is large. So the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture.

But the options don't include the 1.013 λ/a value. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the first two minima from the central maximum as the first and second, which are the same as the first and second orders, and their separation is the difference between their angles.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 1.22 λ/a, which is the position of the first minimum. So maybe the question is actually asking for the position of the first minimum, not the separation between the first two minima. Did I read the question correctly?

Wait, the question says: "What is the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large?"

Wait, the first two minima in the diffraction pattern would be the first and second minima. So their angular positions are theta_1 and theta_2, and the difference is theta_2 - theta_1.

But according to the Bessel function zeros, theta_1 is 1.22 λ/a, and theta_2 is approximately 2.23 λ/a. The difference is about 1.01 λ/a, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the question is considering that when N is very large but finite, the polygon behaves differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, but the problem is considering the diffraction pattern as if it's a single slit with width 2a. Wait, that might not be correct.

Wait, wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. So in a regular polygon, the width of each side is 2a tan(π/N). So for a polygon with N sides, each side is a line segment of length 2a tan(π/N). When N is large, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so the side length becomes approximately 2a (π/N). But as N approaches infinity, the side length approaches zero, but the entire shape becomes a circle.

Wait, but maybe the problem is treating the polygon as a collection of narrow slits, each of width w, arranged around a circle. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture, but the first two minima in the pattern are the same as in a single slit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: when the aperture is a circle of radius a, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is at theta = 1.22 λ/(a), which is option C. So if the question is asking for the position of the first minimum, that's option C. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So that must be the difference between the first and second minima.

Wait, but if the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a, and the second is at approximately 2.23 λ/a, the difference is about 1.01 λ/a. The options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the minima in the diffraction pattern (for a circular aperture) is a sinθ = x_m λ, where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The zeros are 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc. So the first minimum is at theta1 = sin^{-1}(3.8317 λ/(pi a)). But wait, because a sinθ = (x_m) λ/pi, so θ = (x_m λ)/(pi a).

Wait, wait. Because for a circular aperture, the formula is:

a sinθ = (x_m) λ/(2), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula. The general formula is that the minima occur when (pi a sinθ)/lambda = x_m, the zeros of J1(x). So pi a sinθ = x_m lambda.

So theta = arcsin( x_m lambda/(pi a) )

For the first minimum, x_m is 3.8317. So theta1 = arcsin(3.8317 lambda/(pi a)).

Similarly, theta2 = arcsin(7.0156 lambda/(pi a)).

The difference is theta2 - theta1.

But the problem states that the angles are small, so we can approximate sin(theta) ≈ theta. So theta ≈ x_m lambda/(pi a).

So theta1 ≈3.8317 lambda/(pi a) ≈ 1.22 lambda/a.

theta2 ≈7.0156 lambda/(pi a) ≈2.23 lambda/a.

The difference is about (7.0156 - 3.8317)/pi * lambda/a = (3.1839)/pi ≈1.013 lambda/a.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem isn't about a circular aperture but a single slit? Wait, but the question says the aperture is a polygon, and when N is large, it becomes a circle, which would not be a single slit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think about the problem statement again. The problem says the apothems are of the same length a. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is also the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N is large, the shape becomes a circle with radius a. So the circular aperture has radius a, and the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern.

But if the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, this would be the difference between the first and second zeros of the Bessel function, which would be approximately 1.013 lambda/a. Since none of the options match, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the polygon as a multi-slit grating. For a polygon with N sides, each side acting as a slit of width w. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as an approximation to a single slit of width w = 2a tan(π/N). But as N approaches infinity, the width of each side approaches zero, but the number of sides increases.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a single slit of width w, where w approaches zero as N increases. But that doesn't make sense, because as N increases, the polygon becomes a circle, not a single slit. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the diffraction pattern of a polygonal aperture, not a circular one. But when N is large, it's a circle, so the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture. So I'm back to the same conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a set of N slits, each of width a. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the apothem is a, which for a polygon is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a polygon with N sides, the radius of the inscribed circle is a. Then, when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the formula for the minima applies as before.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the question is about the first two minima on either side of the central maximum. So the first minimum on one side is at +theta, and the first minimum on the other side is at -theta. So the angular distance between them would be 2 theta.

In that case, theta would be 1.22 lambda/(a), so the distance would be 2 * 1.22 lambda/a = 2.44 lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the options given include 0.506 λ/a (option D), 0.500 λ/a (option B), 0.610 (A), and 1.220 (C). I'm not seeing any of these matching 1.013.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case, but about a polygon with a large but finite N, but the question says N is infinitely large. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for another approach. The problem states that the apothems are all a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the relationship between the apothem (a), the number of sides (N), and the radius (R) is R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a.

In the far field, the diffraction pattern is determined by the Fourier transform of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the pattern is the Airy disk. But perhaps for a polygon, the formula differs. But when N is very large, it's a circle, so the formula should hold.

Wait, but the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. If the first minimum is at theta1 and the second at theta2, the separation is theta2 - theta1. As previously calculated, this is approximately 1.013 lambda/a. But none of the options match, so perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the first minimum on the same side (so the first minimum is at 1.22, and the second is at 2.23, but the separation is 1.01). But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width w, where w is the length of each side. For a regular polygon, the side length is 2a tan(π/N). So when N approaches infinity, the side length tends to zero, but the number of sides increases. So the effective width of the slit would be zero. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the polygon causing a diffraction pattern similar to a single slit of width 2a. Wait, wait. Let me think: for a regular polygon, the maximum distance from the center to a vertex is R = a / cos(π/N). When N is large, R ≈ a. So the radius is a. So when the light diffracts through this circular aperture, the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually a single-slit diffraction, and the first minimum is at m lambda/a, where m is the order. But for a single slit, the first minimum is at m=1, so lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. Option C is 1.220 lambda/a. Which is the position of the first minimum. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding what the minima are. For a single slit, the minima are at a sin theta = m lambda, with m=1,2,3... So the first minimum is at theta1 = lambda/a, the second at 2 lambda/a, and the third at 3 lambda/a, etc. The distance between the first and second minima is (2-1) lambda/a = lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but that's for a single-slit diffraction. For a circular aperture, the minima are at different positions. So perhaps the question is actually referring to a single-slit, but the initial description is a polygon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the separation between 1.22 and 2.23, which is about 1.01 lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. So in the far field, the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern. The first minimum is at theta1, the second at theta2, and the separation is theta2 - theta1.

If theta1 is 1.22 lambda/a, and theta2 is 2.23 lambda/a, then the separation is 1.01 lambda/a. But the options don't include that.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the first two minima as the first and the second minima, but I'm calculating the separation as 1.013 lambda/a. Since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is option D, 0.506 lambda/a, which is roughly half of 1.013. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width w = 2a, which would make the first minimum at theta = lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a. That's option B. But why would the polygon be treated as a single slit?

Wait, perhaps the polygon is treated as a single slit when considering the direction along one of the sides. Because each side is a line of width 2a tan(pi/N), but as N approaches infinity, tan(pi/N) approaches pi/N, so the side length approaches 2a (pi/N). But that would make the slit width tend to zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon's diameter is 2a, making the radius a. So the single-slit formula would have a = (diameter)/2 = a. Then the first minimum would be at lambda/(a), which is option B (0.5 lambda/a) if the slit width is a. Wait, no, in single-slit, a is the width. So the first minimum is at lambda/a. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of another approach. The problem says all apothems are length a. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to vertex) by R = a / cos(pi/N). As N approaches infinity, R approaches a. So the radius is a, making the diameter 2a. So a circular aperture of radius a.

In single-slit diffraction, the minima are at a sin theta = m lambda, where a is the slit width. So for a slit of width a, the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(a). But in this case, the circular aperture's radius is a, so perhaps the diameter is 2a. So the width of the slit would be 2a. Then the first minimum would be at theta = lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B. But that's only if the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, which doesn't make sense because a polygon has multiple sides.

But perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width 2a. So the first minimum is at 0.5 lambda/a (option B), but the distance between first two minima would be (1.5 lambda/(2a) - 0.5 lambda/(2a)) ) ? No, because in single-slit, the minima are at theta = m lambda/(2a), where m is an integer. So the first minimum is at m=1: 0.5 lambda/a, the second at m=2: 1.0 lambda/a. So the angular distance between them is 0.5 lambda/a. Which is option B. But in that case, the question's answer would be option B, 0.5 lambda/a.

But why would the polygon be treated as a single slit? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon's diffraction pattern as a single slit of width 2a. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking too much. Let's recap. The problem states that when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes a circle with apothem a. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern is at 1.22 lambda/a (option C). But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at 1.22, second at 2.23, difference is ~1.01. Not an option. So perhaps the question is not about the circular case but a single slit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think about the polygon as a multi-slit. For a regular polygon, each side can be considered as a slit. So the diffraction pattern would be the product of the individual slits. But when N is large, the number of slits is large, leading to a more complex pattern. But perhaps the minima positions can be approximated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually about a single slit of width w, which is the length of each side of the polygon. For a polygon with N sides, each side's length is 2a tan(pi/N). So when N approaches infinity, the side length approaches 2a (pi/N). But as N approaches infinity, this becomes a very large number of very narrow slits.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to treat the polygon as a circular aperture, leading to the first minimum at 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be around 1.01 lambda/a, not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the zeros of J1. Let me check the zeros again. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, the second at 7.0156, the third at 10.1735, etc. So the angular positions are theta_m = x_m * lambda/(pi a). So the first two minima are at 3.8317/(pi) ≈1.22 and 7.0156/(pi)≈2.23. So their separation is about 1.01.

Hmm, but the options don't include that. The closest option is D) 0.506 λ/a. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Wait, perhaps the angular separation is between the first minimum on either side of the central maximum, meaning twice the first minimum angle. So 2 * 1.22 = 2.44. No, that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular separation is between the first and second minima on the same side. So 2.23 - 1.22 = 1.01. No option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width w = 2a. Then the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a (option B). The second minimum would be at 2 lambda/(2a) = lambda/a. So the separation is 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B. So if the polygon is treated as a single slit of width 2a, then the answer would be option B.

But why would the polygon be treated as a single slit? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon's width as 2a, making the slit width 2a, so the minima are at m lambda/(2a). The first minimum is at 0.5 lambda/a, the second at 1.0 lambda/a, so the separation is 0.5 lambda/a. So the answer would be option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: for a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, but for a circular aperture, the minima are at a sinθ = x_m λ/(pi), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for m=1, it's 3.8317/(pi) ≈1.22. So for the circular case, the first minimum is at 1.22, and the second at 2.23. The separation is about 1.01, which isn't an option.

But the options include 0.506, which is approximately 3.8317/(2 pi). Because 3.8317/(2 pi) ≈0.609, which is close to option A (0.610). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the angular separation between the first minima on either side of the central maximum, which would be 2 * theta1. So theta1 is 1.22, so 2 * 1.22 = 2.44, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the polygon as a square, but when N approaches infinity, it's a circle.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The problem says when N is infinitely large, which makes the shape a circle. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern is at 1.22 lambda/a, which is option C. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be 1.01 lambda/a, not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.506 lambda/a, which is approximately 3.8317/(2 pi * 1.22) ? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different relation, such as the first minimum being at lambda/(pi a), which would be 0.318 lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the angular separation between the principal maximum and the first minimum. But the question clearly states it's between the first two minima.

I'm stuck. Based on the options, the only one that makes sense in the circular case is option C, which is the first minimum. But the question is about the separation between the first two minima, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, 0.506 λ/a, which is roughly half of 1.013. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the first minima on either side of the central maximum are at theta and -theta, so the angular separation is 2 theta. For theta=0.506, that would be about 1.012, which aligns with our earlier calculation. So perhaps the separation between the first minima on either side is 2*0.506=1.012, which is close to our calculated 1.013. So maybe the angular separation between the first minima on either side is 2 * (lambda/(pi a)) * x_1, where x_1 is 3.8317. So 2*(3.8317/(pi)) λ/a ≈ 2.44 lambda/a. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the angle between the first minima on either side as theta_1 = x_1 lambda/(pi a), so the separation is 2 theta_1 = 2*(3.8317/(pi)) lambda/a ≈2.44 lambda/a, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1.220 lambda/a, as that's the position of the first minimum, but the question is about the separation between the first two minima. But without the correct option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the polygon as a single slit of width w = 2a. So the first minimum is at theta = lambda/(2a) = 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B. The second minimum would be at 1.0 lambda/a, separation 0.5 lambda/a. So the answer would be option B. But the problem states that the polygon becomes a circle when N is large. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: the diffraction pattern of a polygon with infinitely many sides (i.e., a circle) has a central maximum, and the first minima at theta = 1.22 lambda/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the angle between the first minima on either side of the central maximum, which would be 2 * 1.22 lambda/a. But that's 2.44 lambda/a, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck. Based on my analysis, the correct angular separation between the first two minima in the Airy pattern is approximately 1.01 lambda/a, but since this isn't an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the angular width of the central maximum, which is determined by the first minima on either side. The width would be 2 theta, where theta is 1.22 lambda/a. So the width is 2.44 lambda/a, but again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the polygon's diffraction pattern is a single-slit-like pattern, where the first minimum is at lambda/(a), which would be option B (0.5) if the width is 2a. But I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option C, 1.220 lambda/a, which is the position of the first minimum. But the question specifically asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. I'm not confident, but perhaps the intended answer is option C.


The problem involves a polygonal aperture with N sides, where all apothems are of length \(a\). When \(N\) is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle with radius \(a\). Monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falls vertically on this aperture, creating a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in this pattern.

For a circular aperture (Airy pattern), the minima occur at angles where the Bessel function \(J_1(k a \sin\theta)\) has zeros. The zeros of \(J_1(x)\) are approximately \(x_m = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, \dots\). The angular positions of the minima are given by:

\[
\theta_m = \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The first minimum occurs at \(\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.22 \lambda/a\), and the second minimum occurs at \(\theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 2.23 \lambda/a\). The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{\pi a} \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.013 \lambda/a.
\]

However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is \(1.220 \lambda/a\), which corresponds to the position of the first minimum. This suggests that the question may be asking for the position of the first minimum rather than the angular distance between the first two minima. Given the ambiguity in the question, the most reasonable interpretation is that the answer refers to the position of the first minimum.

Thus, the angular position of the first minimum is approximately \(1.22 \lambda/a\), corresponding to **Option C**.
