Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The system's state at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a vector, right? So the state vector is Î¨ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Hmm, I should probably normalize it because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, and the sum of squares should be 1.

Wait, wait, but sometimes in problems they might not require normalization because the observable's measurement probabilities only depend on the squared moduli of the components. But yeah, I should check if the state is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the components.

The components are -1, 2, and 1. Their squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. So the state isn't normalized. But in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually supposed to be normalized. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects me to proceed without normalizing, or perhaps it's okay because the observable is given.

Wait, the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me look at P. It's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(
