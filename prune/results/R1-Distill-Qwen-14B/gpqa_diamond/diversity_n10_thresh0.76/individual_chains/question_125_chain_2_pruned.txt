Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning the ropes. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is a standard problem, so I probably need to recall how that works.

First, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, right, in three dimensions, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z. The total energy is something like E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, maybe? Or wait, I think the harmonic oscillator in each dimension has energy levels of (n + 1/2) ħω, so for three dimensions, the total energy would be the sum for each direction. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, I also heard that in three dimensions, the energy levels can be described using the principal quantum number n, such that n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n corresponds to a certain energy. So the energy would be E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Yeah, that sounds right
