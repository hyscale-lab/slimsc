Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. The magnetic field has a value of 1 Tesla and small m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, but since it's small, maybe m is close to zero?

Wait, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the Balmer lambda for the hydrogen spectrum. That must correspond to the transition from n=2 to n=1, or maybe n=3 to n=2? I think 0.486 nm is the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait, no, wait, isn't that the Lyman series? Oh wait, no, Lyman is n=1 to 2, but the Balmer series is n=2 to 1? No, wait, no. The Balmer series is from higher n to n=2. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, which emits a photon with wavelength about 0.486 μm.

So the transition energy ΔE would be the energy difference between n=3 and n=2 in hydrogen. I can calculate that using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV for hydrogen. The energy levels are given by E_n = -Rhc/(n²), where h is Planck's constant and c the speed of light. So the energy difference ΔE between two levels n_initial and n_final is E_n_final - E_n_initial. Wait, wait, no. Since E_n is negative, a transition from higher n (like 3) to lower (like 2) would release energy, so ΔE is the magnitude of E_2 - E_3, which would be positive.

So let's compute ΔE. Since E_n = -13.6 eV * (1/n²), for n=2, E2 is -13.6/(4) = -3.4 eV. For n=3, E3 is -13.6/(9) ≈ -1.511 eV. So ΔE = E3 - E2? Wait, no. Because when the electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference. So ΔE = E2 - E3. Wait, no, that's not right. Because E3 is higher than E2 (since E3 is less negative). So E3 = -1.511 eV; E2 = -3.4 eV. The energy difference going from n=3 to n=2 is E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But energy can't be negative, so the magnitude is about 1.889 eV. So ΔE ≈ 1.89 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * m_s, but wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of orbital magnetic moment. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_l = (μ_B) * l / (l(l+1))^(1/2), but wait, no, that's the expectation value. Alternatively, the Zeeman effect is about the interaction of the magnetic moment with B.

Wait, the problem says small m. So m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can be 0, ±1, ..., up to ±l. So for small m, maybe m is 0 or 1. The paramagnetic coupling term here is probably referring to the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, or is it m times that?

Wait, the magnetic dipole moment μ for the orbital angular momentum is μ = (μ_B) * (L_z / ħ), since L_z = m ħ. So L_z = m ħ, so μ = μ_B * m. Then the energy is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, which is the same direction as L_z, so H = -μ_B * m * B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain; perhaps the sign depends on convention, but for magnitude, it's |μ_B * m * B|.

So the paramagnetic term would be proportional to m * B. But m is small, so let's think about the value.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can take values from -l to +l. For small m, perhaps l is small as well, like l=0 or l=1. If l=0, then m=0 and the term is zero. For l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. But the question says small m, so maybe m=1 or 0.

Wait, but in any case, let's compute the paramagnetic energy shift for m=1. Because if m is small, perhaps it's the maximum value for a given l, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the magnitude of the paramagnetic term relative to the transition energy, so perhaps I should just calculate the maximum possible for small m.

Assuming m=1, then the paramagnetic energy shift would be H = μ_B * B * m. Wait, but I think the formula is H = -μ·B, which would be -μ_B * m * B. But since we're looking for the magnitude, it doesn't matter about the sign.

So μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. B is 1 T. m is small, say m=1.

So ΔE_param = μ_B * m * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

But wait, that's in Joules. Let's convert that to eV because the transition energy is in eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE_param = 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Wait, that's 5.8e-5 eV. But the transition energy was about 1.89 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE. So the ratio would be (5.8e-5 eV) / (1.89 eV) ≈ 3e-5. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers. μ_B is indeed about 9.27e-24 J/T. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The hydrogen atom's energy levels have a certain splitting when an external magnetic field is applied. The Zeeman effect causes the energy levels to split into m levels. The energy shift for each m is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. But when the magnetic field is weak, this shift is small compared to the original energy levels. So in this case, the ΔE_param would be on the order of 1e-4 eV, which is way smaller than the transition energy of about 1.89 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy ΔE. Therefore, the average energy ⟨H⟩ due to the paramagnetic term is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but the problem asks to compare ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. So ⟨H⟩ is the expectation value of the paramagnetic Hamiltonian, which would be μ_B * B * m. So if that's 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is about 1.89 eV, then ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct comparison is ⟨H⟩ << ΔE, which is option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energy scales.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between two energy levels of the hydrogen atom. Using the Rydberg formula, the energy levels are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{Rhc}{n^2},
\]

where \( R \) is the Rydberg constant (\( R \approx 13.6 \, \text{eV} \)), \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( n \) is the principal quantum number. For the transition with wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \), this corresponds to the Balmer-alpha line, where the electron transitions from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \). The energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = |E_2 - E_3| = \left| -\frac{13.6}{4} - \left(-\frac{13.6}{9} \right) \right| \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:

\[
H = -\mu \cdot B,
\]

where \( \mu \) is the magnetic moment and \( B \) is the magnetic field. For orbital magnetic moments, the magnetic moment is proportional to the orbital magnetic quantum number \( m \), and the energy shift is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot |m|,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton. Given \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) and small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The paramagnetic coupling term (\( \Delta E_{\text{param}} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \)) is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy (\( \Delta E \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV} \)). The ratio of the two is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{param}}}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.8 \times 10^{-5}}{1.89} \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct comparison is:

\[
\langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E.
\]
