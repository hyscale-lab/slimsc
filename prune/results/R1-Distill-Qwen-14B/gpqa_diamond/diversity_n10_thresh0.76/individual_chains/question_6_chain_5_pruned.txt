Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be broken down into parts that make the problem separable. The potential here has two terms: one that's purely radial (depends only on r) and another that depends on both r and θ (the cosine squared term). 

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me see if I can factor this or separate it into radial and angular parts.

I can factor out kr². So V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, that might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe I can think about whether this potential is separable. In other words, can I write the potential as a sum of a function of r and a function of θ?

Looking at it again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr², so V = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) ]. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider if the potential can be expressed as a function of r and another function of θ multiplied by r squared. Wait, but that's what it already is. So the potential is V(r,θ) = [ (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) ] * (kr²). 

Wait, maybe I can write this as a sum of two terms: one purely radial and the other angular. Let's try. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the form of the potential and whether the system can be solved using separation of variables in polar coordinates.

I remember that in the case of
