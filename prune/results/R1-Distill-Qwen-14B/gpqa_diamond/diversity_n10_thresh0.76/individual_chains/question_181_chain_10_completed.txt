Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain part of the Sun's fusion process stops. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if something happens in the core, we wouldn't notice the effects on neutrinos immediately because neutrinos can pass through the Sun without interacting much. But wait, neutrinos are produced in various layers of the Sun, like the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, right, the pp chain is the dominant source of energy in the Sun, and the CNO cycle contributes a bit more in heavier stars, but the Sun is mostly pp.

So the pp-III branch... what's that? I remember the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main pp-I branch produces helium-4 from two protons fusing, but if there's enough temperature and density, some of the protons might undergo the pp-II branch, which produces boron-8, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the details. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might involve higher energy reactions, maybe involving heavier nuclei. Wait, I think pp-III is a part of the pp chain where three protons fuse, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the pp chain has multiple steps, and the pp-III branch is a specific part. Since the question specifies it's the pp-III branch that stops, I should focus on that.

But regardless of the specifics, if pp-III stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Well, the Sun's main neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8 (I think), which is a product of the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch is a significant part of the pp chain, stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos produced.

Wait, but neutrinos come from different processes. The main ones are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8 (pe process), and there are also others like the pep process (which is a part of the proton-electron-proton branch, a minor part of the pp chain). So if the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, stopping it would reduce the number of boron-8 nuclei produced, which would mean fewer neutrinos from that decay. But how does this affect the flux in different energy bands?

The question is about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out which neutrino energies are in each band.

Boron-8 decays into lithium-7 and two positrons, emitting three neutrinos: two electron neutrinos and one anti-electron neutrino. The neutrinos have energies up to around 15-20 keV each, so the total energy per decay is about 18 keV (since 8B → 7Li + 2e+ + ν_e + ν̄_e). Wait, no, I think the maximum energy for each ν is about 15 keV. So each neutrino is around 15 keV, but the total energy released is about 18 keV. So the neutrinos are low-energy, around 10s of keV. Wait, but the question's bands are in the hundreds of keV. That doesn't add up. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering higher-energy neutrinos from other processes. Oh, or maybe it's about the energy of the neutrinos in terms of the kinetic energy when detected, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the energy bands are referring to the neutrino species, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait another thought: the pp chain produces neutrinos via the decay of boron-8, which emits low-energy neutrinos (like ~15 keV each). So neutrinos in the 100s of keV must come from other sources. Oh! Maybe from the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle produces carbon-14, which decays into nitrogen-14, emitting a neutrino. The neutrino from carbon-14 decay is higher energy, around 1.8 MeV. So, that's in the ~1800 keV range, which is higher than the bands given. Hmm. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the processes.

Wait, the CNO cycle can produce some neutrinos as well. Carbon-14 decays with a half-life of about 5700 years, emitting an electron antineutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 1.8 MeV (so 1800 keV). So that's much higher than the bands in the question. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another process. Oh! There's the process where helium-3 captures a proton to form helium-4, which emits a neutrino. I think that's called the He-p process. The energy of those neutrinos is higher than the pp chain ones. Let me think. The He-p process neutrinos have energies around 100s of keV. For example, the neutrino energy from the He-p process is about 800 keV on average. So any neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band would be from the He-p process. Those in the 800-900 keV band would also be from the same process, but perhaps higher energies.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the pp chain is affected? The pp chain has different branches. If pp-III is a part that produces He-4 via certain steps, perhaps its stoppage would affect the production of He-4, which is part of the main fusion. But wait, the He-p process requires He-3, which is mainly produced in the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch stops, perhaps the production of He-3 is reduced, which in turn affects the He-p process.

Wait, but the He-p process is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy, right? The main source of He-3 is the pp chain. So if pp-III stops, maybe the production of He-3 decreases. Wait, I thought the He-p process is a minor part, so it's not the main source of neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, would that affect the production of He-3, thereby affecting the He-p neutrinos?

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p process is a branch of the pp chain. Let me think: the pp chain can have the main pp-I branch, which fuses two protons into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei fuse into helium-4. Alternatively, sometimes a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus, producing helium-4 and emitting a neutrino. That's the He-p process, and it produces a higher-energy neutrino, around 800 keV or so. So, if the pp-III branch is a part that's responsible for producing He-3, then stopping it would reduce the amount of He-3 available for both the main pp chain and the He-p process.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of He-3 is reduced. Since the He-p process uses He-3, the production of those neutrinos would decrease. But wait, the main pp chain would also be affected, but perhaps the main pp chain's neutrino production is via the boron-8 decay, which is a separate process.

So, the flux we're talking about is from the He-p process in band 2 (800-900 keV) and perhaps something else in band 1 (700-800 keV). Wait, but boron-8 neutrinos are around 15 keV, so definitely in a lower band. So what's in the 700-800 keV band?

Ah, perhaps the neutrinos from the He-p process. So the He-p process neutrinos are around 800 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, which affects the production of He-3, then the He-p process would produce fewer neutrinos. So the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would decrease. But wait, what about band 1, 700-800 keV? Are there any neutrinos in that range?

Wait, the He-p process emits neutrinos with an average energy of about 800 keV, so they would be in band 2 (800-900). But perhaps there's a tail in the distribution—some He-p neutrinos have lower energies, maybe down to about 700 keV. So if the production of He-3 is reduced, then more of the neutrinos would be at the lower end of the He-p spectrum, but overall, the flux in band 1 and band 2 would both decrease.

Wait, but if the production of He-3 stops, then the He-p process can't happen because He-p requires He-3. So in that case, the neutrino flux from the He-p process (which is in band 2) would drop. But what about other neutrino sources? Are there any neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range from other processes?

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p process also emits lower-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps the main pp chain has a process that emits neutrinos in the 700 keV range. Wait, another thought: maybe the pep process (proton-electron-proton) produces some neutrinos. The pep process is a branch of the pp chain where two protons and an electron combine to form deuterium, emitting a neutrino. The neutrino energy in the pep process is around 1.4 MeV, so that's higher than the bands in question.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of other isotopes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the neutrinos from the CNO cycle contribute some in the higher keV ranges. Wait, the CNO neutrinos are around 1.8 MeV, so they're higher than the 900 keV of band 2. So maybe the 700-800 keV band is from the He-p process, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the boron-8 neutrinos, but that doesn't fit the energy ranges. So I'm a bit confused. Let me try to reorganize.

The question: pp-III branch stops. What does that do to the neutrino flux in two bands?

The pp-III branch probably contributes to the main pp chain. If it stops, then the production of certain isotopes necessary for the main chain might be reduced.

The main neutrino sources are:

1. Beryllium-7 in the Sun's core. Wait, Be-7 is produced in the pp chain and then captures an electron neutrino to become Li-7, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But Be-7's half-life is about 53 days, so it can transport upward in the Sun and decay there, emitting neutrinos. But Be-7 neutrinos are around 470 keV on average, right? So that would fall into band 1 (700-800 keV? No, 470 is below 700). So Be-7 neutrinos are in a lower band.

2. Boron-8 decays into Li-7, emitting neutrinos at about 15 keV each, so that's much lower than 700 keV.

3. The He-p process emits neutrinos around 800 keV.

4. The CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos, around 1.8 MeV.

Wait, so Be-7 neutrinos are around 470 keV, which is below band 1. So if pp-III stops, would that affect Be-7 production? Because Be-7 is part of the pp chain. If the pp-III branch is a step in the pp chain, stopping it might reduce the production of Be-7. But Be-7's neutrinos are around 470 keV, which is below band 1, so they wouldn't contribute to the bands in the question.

So back to the He-p process. The He-p process produces neutrinos around 800 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, which is a part of the pp chain, and if that part affects the production of He-3, which is necessary for the He-p process, then the He-p neutrino flux would decrease.

So band 2 (800-900 keV) is mainly He-p neutrinos. If the pp-III stops, then He-3 production is reduced, so the He-p process is reduced, leading to fewer neutrinos in band 2.

What about band 1, 700-800 keV? Are there any neutrinos from other processes in that range?

Hmm, perhaps there's another neutrino source. Let me think about other possible processes. For example, the decay of lithium-7? No, I don't think so. Or perhaps the electron-capture processes in other isotopes?

Wait, maybe I'm missing some other neutrino sources. Oh! There are also the neutrinos from the decay of oxygen-15 in the CNO cycle, but I don't think their energies are in the hundreds of keV. O-15 decays into nitrogen-15 and emits a neutrino, but those neutrinos are around 3.5 MeV, which is way higher than the bands in question.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of fluorine-19? I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the He-p process have a range of energies, not just a single value. So some of them might be in band 1 and others in band 2.

Wait, if the He-p neutrinos have a spectrum, with an average around 800 keV, but some can be a bit lower, maybe down to 700 keV. So if the production of He-3 is reduced, but not stopped entirely, then the number of He-p neutrinos in both bands would decrease. But the question is about the ratio of the fluxes between band 1 and band 2.

If the pp-III branch stops, the He-p process is affected. So both band 1 and band 2 fluxes would decrease. But the question is about the ratio before and after.

Wait, the problem states that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. So neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, but they take time to reach the Earth. But neutrinos move very quickly, so the Earth would detect the change very soon. But the problem is about the flux, which is the number per cm² per second. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the effect on neutrinos we detect would start to be seen now.

Wait, but the neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and the pp-III is in the core. So if it stops, the flux of neutrinos from that process would drop immediately (or nearly so, as neutrinos don't take long to escape). So the flux from the He-p process would drop, but other processes would continue as before.

So, before the pp-III stopped, the He-p neutrinos (band 2) were being produced, and any neutrinos in band 1 (if any) from other processes. But if the He-p process is the main source of band 2, and the main pp chain is the source of band 1 (but perhaps there are none), then the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would be... Well, if band 1 is unaffected and band 2 is reduced, the ratio would increase.

Wait, but what is the main source for the 700-800 keV band? I thought the He-p neutrinos are around 800 keV, so band 1 might have some of them as well. So if the He-p process is reduced, then both band 1 and band 2 would be affected, but perhaps band 2 is higher in energy.

Wait, another approach. The He-p neutrino spectrum has a peak around 800 keV but extends to higher energies. If the production stops, the overall number of He-p neutrinos would decrease, but the shape of the spectrum would remain the same. So the ratio between band 1 and band 2 would depend on the original distribution.

In the original state, let's say the number of neutrinos in band 1 (700-800) is, say, N1, and band 2 (800-900) is N2. The ratio is N1/N2. After the pp-III stops, both N1 and N2 are reduced, but the ratio remains the same if the spectrum shape doesn't change. But wait, if the pp-III stops, the production of He-3 stops, so the He-p process stops entirely. Wait, no, because the He-p process uses He-3, so if He-3 production stops, the He-p process would stop as well. So the flux of He-p neutrinos would drop to zero.

Wait, but does the pp-III branch directly produce He-3? Or is He-3 a product of other parts of the pp chain?

Wait, the main pp chain goes like this: two protons fuse to form deuterium, another proton fuses to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei fuse to form helium-4. Alternatively, a helium-3 can capture a proton to form helium-4, emitting a neutrino (the He-p process). So if the pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain that produces helium-3, stopping it would reduce the production of He-3, thus reducing the He-p process, which relies on He-3. So the He-p neutrino flux would drop.

But if the He-p process stops, then the neutrino flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop. But band 1, 700-800 keV, would also be affected if the He-p process is the main source there. So perhaps the ratio would change.

Wait, but if the He-p process is the main source for both bands, and it's stopped, then both fluxes would drop. But if band 1 has a lower energy, maybe there's another process contributing neutrinos there. Alternatively, since He-p neutrinos are around 800 keV, perhaps band 1 has a small contribution from He-p, and band 2 has more. So if He-p stops, both bands' fluxes drop, but their ratio depends on the relative contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't affect the He-p process. Maybe the pp-III is a different branch that doesn't produce He-3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: the question says that all other reactions remain as they were except the pp-III. So the only change is the pp-III stopping. So which neutrinos are affected?

If the pp-III was producing some specific neutrinos, like the He-p ones, then their flux would drop. Suppose that band 2 is mainly affected, so its flux would drop, and if band 1's flux is from another process, then the ratio would increase.

But what neutrinos are in band 1 (700-800 keV)? I'm not certain, but perhaps the He-p process also contributes to band 1, and the main contribution is in band 2. So if the He-p process stops, both bands would have lower flux, but the ratio would depend on how much each band was affected.

Alternatively, maybe the He-p process is the main contributor to band 2, and the main pp chain's neutrinos (from boron-8) are in a lower energy range, so band 1 is not affected. So if the He-p neutrinos drop, band 2's flux drops, but band 1's remains the same.

Wait, but the main pp chain's neutrinos (from B-8) are around 15 keV, so they don't contribute to either band. So the only neutrinos in the ~700-800 keV range would be from the He-p process. So if the He-p process is stopped, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would drop, and the same for band 2 (800-900). So the ratio would be the same as before, because both are equally affected.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the ratio after the pp-III stoppage. So if the He-p process is responsible for both bands, and it's stopped, then the flux in both bands would decrease, so the ratio would remain the same.

But that doesn't make sense because the options don't have 1 as the correct answer in the context. Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped. So perhaps the He-p process is not affected, and another process is.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think again.

The pp chain produces B-8, which decays into Li-7, emitting three neutrinos (sum around 18 keV). The He-p process uses He-3, which is a product of the pp chain, so stopping the pp chain would reduce He-3, thus reducing the He-p neutrinos.

But the He-p neutrinos are in the ~800 keV range, so they're in band 2 (800-900). So if the He-p process stops, the flux in band 2 would drop. But what about band 1 (700-800)? If the He-p neutrinos have a spectrum that extends below 800 keV, then some would be in band 1. So if the He-p process stops, both bands' fluxes would drop, but perhaps the ratio would depend on how the spectrum is distributed.

Alternatively, maybe band 1 has other neutrino sources, like the decay of fluorine-19 or something else. But I don't remember any neutrino processes in the Sun that emit in the 700-800 keV range except the He-p process.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in band 1. For example, if the pp-III branch produces some neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range, and it stops, then band 1's flux would drop, while band 2's flux remains the same. That would change the ratio.

But I'm not sure if the pp-III branch produces any neutrinos. The main neutrino sources are the B-8 decay (pp chain), He-p process (using He-3 from the pp chain), and CNO neutrinos (from C-14 decay). So the pp-III stopping would affect the He-p neutrinos, which are in band 2, but not the B-8 neutrinos (which are too low energy) or the CNO neutrinos (too high energy).

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what the He-p neutrinos are like. The He-p process occurs when a He-3 captures a proton to form He-4, emitting a neutrino. The neutrino energy is about 800 keV on average, but the spectrum extends from around 200 keV to several MeV. So some He-p neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range, and others are in 800-900.

Therefore, if the production of He-3 stops (due to the pp-III branch stopping), the He-p process stops, and the flux in both bands would decrease. But the ratio depends on how much each band is affected.

If the He-p process's flux in band 1 is, say, 10% of the original, and in band 2 is 90%, then stopping He-p would cause both to drop by the same proportion. So the ratio would remain the same. But that can't be right because the problem states that the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the He-p neutrinos. Perhaps the He-p process produces neutrinos with an average energy around 800 keV, so the majority of them are in band 2. So the flux in band 2 would be higher than in band 1, which would have a smaller number of lower-energy He-p neutrinos.

If the He-p process is the main source for both bands, then stopping it would cause both fluxes to drop. However, if the flux in band 2 was higher before, and both drop by the same factor, the ratio would remain the same. But if the He-p neutrinos are primarily in band 2, with a smaller contribution to band 1, then stopping He-p would cause band 2's flux to drop more than band 1's.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the He-p neutrinos are the main contributors to band 2, and band 1 has negligible contribution from He-p. So if He-p stops, band 2's flux drops, but band 1's flux (from other sources) remains the same. But what other sources are in band 1?

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the possible options. The options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C) 1, D) 0.1.

If the He-p process is the main source for band 2 (800-900 keV), stopping it would cause band 2's flux to drop, while band 1's flux remains the same (if it's from another source). So the ratio (band 1 / band 2) would increase. But what if band 1 was also affected?

Wait, perhaps the main neutrino source in band 1 is from another process. Alternatively, since the He-p process is the only source in that energy range, stopping it would cause both bands to drop, but the ratio remains the same.

But I'm not confident. Let me think about the problem again. The question is about the ratio of flux between two bands after the pp-III branch stops. So, if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in band 2, and not in band 1, stopping it would reduce band 2's flux, while band 1's flux remains the same. So the ratio would increase.

Alternatively, if both bands are affected equally, the ratio remains the same.

Wait, but neutrinos from the He-p process have a range of energies. So if the He-p process stops, the entire spectrum is affected. So the flux in both bands would decrease. But the ratio might not change because the shape of the spectrum is preserved.

Wait, but if the He-p process is the only contributor to both bands, then stopping it would cause both fluxes to drop, but their ratio would stay the same. So the ratio of band1 to band2 remains the same as before.

But then, what was the original ratio? In reality, I don't know the exact numbers. But perhaps the flux in band 2 is higher than band 1. So if both are reduced by the same factor, the ratio remains the same. So the answer would be 1, option C.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: the He-p process emits neutrinos in a broad range, say, 800 keV is the average. So more are in band 2 than in band 1. So if the He-p process stops, flux in band 2 drops more than band 1. So the ratio (band 1 / band 2) would increase. For example, if before the ratio was 0.5, after stopping, both decrease, but band 2 decreases more, making the ratio higher, say 1.

But without knowing the initial ratio, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the He-p neutrinos are in band 2, so the flux in band 1 is unaffected. So if band 1's flux is from another source, then the ratio would increase. But I can't think of another source in band 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about what happens when the pp chain stops. The pp chain produces B-8, which decays into Li-7, giving neutrinos. The He-p process uses He-3 from the pp chain, so if the pp chain stops, He-p stops.

So, if the pp chain stops, then B-8 production stops, but what about the He-p process? If the He-p process stops, then the He-p neutrinos (around 800 keV) would stop. So the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) would stop, while others like B-8 (15 keV) are unaffected.

But the question is about the ratio of band 1 to band 2. If the He-p process is the only source for band 2, and the B-8 neutrinos are in a different range, then band 1's flux would be from another source. Wait, but I can't think of a source for band 1. Maybe the He-p process contributes to both bands, so stopping it would cause both fluxes to drop. But again, without knowing their relative contributions, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p process contributes to band 2 but not band 1. Wait, no, because the He-p neutrinos have a range of energies, some in band 1. So if the He-p process stops, both bands would be affected. So the ratio would remain the same.

But if the He-p process is the only source for both bands, then the ratio remains the same. So the ratio is 1, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p process contributes more to band 2 than band 1. So the flux in band 2 is higher than band 1. If the He-p process stops, both decrease, but since band 2 had more, the ratio increases.

Wait, but without knowing the initial ratio, I can't be sure. The question asks for the approximate ratio. Maybe the He-p process is the main source for band 2, and the main source for band 1 is something else. But I don't know of any other source.

Alternatively, maybe the He-p process contributes neutrinos to both bands, but the majority are in band 2. So the ratio (band 1 / band 2) would be a small number, like 0.1, which is option D.

Wait, but if the He-p process is the main source of both, then the ratio would have been, say, 0.5 before stopping, and after stopping, both fluxes are zero, so the ratio is undefined. But in reality, the question is about the ratio after the process stops, so the fluxes would be zero. But the options don't include zero. Hmm, perhaps the question is considering that the He-p process only contributes to band 2, not band 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos are in a lower band, and the He-p process is the only source for band 2. Then, if the He-p process stops, band 2's flux drops, while band 1's flux is from another process, perhaps zero. But I don't think so.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the He-p process is the main source for band 2, and stopping it affects band 2 more than band 1, then the ratio (band1/band2) increases. If band 1 had a flux of F1 and band 2 F2 originally, after stopping, F1 is same and F2 drops. So the ratio becomes F1/(F2'), which is higher than F1/F2.

But if the He-p process is the only source for band 2, and band 1 has another source, perhaps the ratio would increase. But I don't know what that other source is.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch isn't the main source of He-p neutrinos, so stopping it doesn't affect band 2 much.

I'm not making progress. Let me think of another approach. The Sun's neutrino flux is dominated by B-8 neutrinos (~86% of the total), followed by He-p (~14%), and CNO (~0.5%). So B-8 is 15 keV, He-p is ~800 keV, and CNO is ~1.8 MeV.

So if the He-p process stops, the neutrino flux from the Sun would drop from ~14% to zero. So the neutrinos from He-p are in band 2 (800-900). Band 1 (700-800) would have negligible He-p neutrinos, perhaps? Or do they?

Wait, the He-p neutrino spectrum has a mean energy of around 800 keV, but it's a distribution. So some are below 800, some above. If the He-p process stops, the total flux in band 2 drops, but band 1 also drops, but by a smaller amount.

But the question is the ratio after the pp-III stops.

If the He-p process contributes 14% to the total, and if the majority of that is in band 2, then after stopping, band 2's flux drops by 14%, while band 1's flux, which might have, say, 1% from He-p, drops by 1%. So the ratio (band1/band2) would be (0.01/0.0086) ≈ 1.16, which is near 1. But this is a rough estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p neutrinos are distributed such that about 50% are below 800 keV and 50% above. Then, if the He-p process stops, both bands' fluxes would drop by the same proportion. So the ratio remains the same.

But the problem is that in reality, the He-p neutrinos have a peak around 800 keV, so more are in band 2 than band 1. So if the He-p process stops, the flux in band 2 drops more than band 1, causing the ratio (band1/band2) to increase.

But without exact data, it's hard to know. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So what's the approximate ratio?

If the He-p process contributes to both bands, and band 2 has more flux, the ratio would be lower than 1. If the process stops, both fluxes drop, but band 2 drops more. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would increase. But I'm not sure if it's 0.1, 1, or 10.

Wait, another approach: the He-p neutrino flux is roughly a tenth of the B-8 flux. So the total flux from He-p is about 14% of the total solar neutrino flux, which is about 1/6th of the B-8 (86% of total). So the He-p flux is about 14% / (86% +14%) = ~14% of the total. But in terms of energy bands, the He-p neutrinos are mainly in band 2.

So before stopping, the flux in band 2 (He-p) is 14% of the total, and band 1 has some from He-p as well, but perhaps negligible. So the ratio (band1 / band2) is low, maybe 0.1.

But wait, if the He-p neutrinos have a significant fraction in band 1 (700-800 keV), like say 10% of the He-p flux is in band1 and 90% in band2, then the original ratio would be (0.1 * 14%) / (0.9 *14%) )= 0.11, which is about 0.1.

After stopping the He-p process, both band1 and band2 fluxes drop to zero. But the question is about the ratio after stopping, but if both are zero, the ratio is undefined. But wait, the question is not about the absolute flux but the ratio between the two bands.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So, the He-p process stops, and thus the He-p neutrinos stop. So band 1's flux (from He-p) would drop to zero, and band 2's also drops to zero. So the ratio would be undefined, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III stopping doesn't affect the He-p process. Then, the ratio remains the same. But that's not possible because the He-p process uses He-3, which is produced in the pp chain.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is not a part of the main pp chain but a different process. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a specific part that only affects certain neutrinos.

Alternatively, maybe the He-p process isn't affected by the pp-III stopping. That would mean that the flux in band 2 remains, while band 1's flux is from another source.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think of the options. If the He-p process stops, the flux in band 2 drops, but band 1's flux (if from another source) remains. So the ratio would be higher. If band 1's flux is from another process that isn't affected, the ratio increases.

But I can't figure out what that other process is. Maybe the pp-III branch stopping doesn't affect the He-p process. But I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the He-p process is part of the pp-III branch, so stopping it would stop the He-p neutrinos. So both band 1 and band 2 fluxes drop, but the ratio remains the same.

But without knowing the initial ratio, I can't say. However, if the initial ratio was 1, then the answer is C.

Alternatively, considering that the He-p process is the main contributor to band 2, and with it stopped, the flux in band 2 drops, but band 1's flux (if from another source) remains the same, so the ratio increases.

But without knowing the other source, it's tricky. So perhaps the ratio is 1, option C.

Wait, I'm not making progress, so I'll make a guess. I think the He-p neutrinos are the main source for band 2. So stopping pp-III would stop He-p, thus reducing band 2's flux. If band 1's flux is from another source, the ratio would be higher. But perhaps the other source is the B-8 neutrinos, but they are at lower energies. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio remains the same, so the answer is C) 1.


The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton (pp) chain, which is responsible for producing helium-3 (He-3), a critical component of the He-p process. The He-p process occurs when a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form helium-4, emitting a high-energy neutrino with an average energy of ~800 keV. This neutrino spectrum extends from ~200 keV to several MeV, with a significant fraction of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range (band 2).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - The main neutrino sources in the Sun are:
     - **Boron-8 (B-8) decay**: Produces low-energy neutrinos (~15 keV), which do not contribute to the energy bands in question.
     - **He-p process**: Produces neutrinos with energies around 800 keV, making it the primary contributor to band 2 (800-900 keV). Some of these neutrinos also fall into band 1 (700-800 keV).
     - **CNO cycle**: Produces very high-energy neutrinos (~1.8 MeV), which are not relevant to the given bands.

2. **Impact of pp-III Stoppage**:
   - The pp-III branch is crucial for producing He-3, which is necessary for the He-p process. If the pp-III branch stops, the production of He-3 is reduced, leading to a significant decrease in the He-p neutrino flux.
   - Since the He-p neutrinos are the primary contributors to both bands, their flux in both band 1 and band 2 would decrease. However, the relative impact on each band depends on the shape of the He-p neutrino spectrum.

3. **Flux Ratio**:
   - The He-p neutrino spectrum peaks around 800 keV, meaning band 2 (800-900 keV) receives a larger fraction of the He-p neutrino flux compared to band 1 (700-800 keV). If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease more significantly than in band 1, leading to an increase in the ratio of band 1 to band 2 fluxes.
   - However, if the spectrum shape remains unchanged and both bands are affected proportionally, the ratio would remain approximately the same.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (10)**: This would imply a substantial increase in the ratio, which is unlikely unless band 1 is unaffected while band 2 is completely stopped. This is inconsistent with the He-p neutrino spectrum.
   - **Option B (0.01)**: This would imply a drastic reduction in band 1 flux relative to band 2, which is inconsistent with the He-p neutrino spectrum.
   - **Option C (1)**: This suggests that the ratio remains unchanged, which is plausible if both bands are affected proportionally by the stoppage of the He-p process.
   - **Option D (0.1)**: This would imply a small increase in the ratio, consistent with the idea that band 2 is affected more significantly than band 1 due to the He-p neutrino spectrum.

### Conclusion:
Given the He-p neutrino spectrum and the proportional impact of the pp-III stoppage on both bands, the most reasonable assumption is that the ratio of band 1 to band 2 fluxes remains approximately the same.
