Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each a Michael addition reaction. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, malonate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl? No, wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. Oh wait, no, actually, malonate is a diester, like CH2(COOR)2. So it's a dienolate, which can act as the nucleophile. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Structure-wise, that's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, the structure is more accurately CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? Or maybe it's (E)-CH2-CO-OCH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So as
