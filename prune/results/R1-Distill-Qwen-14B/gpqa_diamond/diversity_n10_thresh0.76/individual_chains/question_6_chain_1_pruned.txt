Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. And the options are A to D, each with a different expression for energy E in terms of n_x, n_y, and some constants.

Wait, I remember that in two-dimensional quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, it's often helpful to separate the potential into parts that can be solved independently. Oh right, sometimes potentials can be expressed in terms of different coordinate systems or by using separation of variables.

Let me think about the given potential. V(r,θ) has two terms: (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k r² cos²θ. The first term looks like part of a harmonic oscillator potential, which in two dimensions would be something like (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's (1/2)k r², so maybe it's similar but with a different spring constant. Oh wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω² r², but here it's given as (1/2)k r². So perhaps we can relate k to m and ω, but maybe that's not necessary right now.

The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Cos squared theta usually makes me think of angular dependence, maybe something related to angular momentum or the polar coordinates. Alternatively, it might be possible to express this in terms of the x or y components. Oh wait, because x = r cosθ, so cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ is x²/r². Therefore, the second term can be rewritten as (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Because x is r cosθ, so yeah, that substitution makes sense. So combining these, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Hmm, but r² is x² + y², right? Because in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y². So substituting that back, the potential becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute that.

Wait, expanding that: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x². Adding the x² terms: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² = 2k x². So the potential becomes V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! So it's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. Because in general, a 2D harmonic oscillator has potential (1/2)mω_x² x² + (1/2)mω_y
