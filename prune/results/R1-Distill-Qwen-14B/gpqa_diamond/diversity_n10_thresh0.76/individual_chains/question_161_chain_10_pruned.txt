Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because if there's less gas, the electrons won't scatter as much, right? That should give better images.

But even after creating this vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. That makes sense because reaching a perfect vacuum is impossible. So Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right?

Wait, but when he starts the electron beam, he notices something about the mean free path. It's now λ2 instead of λ1. The temperature remains the same, so why would the mean free path change?

Hmm, mean free path (λ) depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density of gas molecules and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula involving pressure: λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules. Oh wait, maybe more commonly, λ is proportional to 1/(P * sqrt(T)) or something like that. Wait, let me think. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and directly proportional to temperature. Because higher pressure means more molecules, so shorter mean free path. Higher temperature increases the average speed, so molecules can go further between collisions.

But in this case, the pressure in the sample compartment is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on, right? Because the vacuum state is the same. So why would λ change? Unless something else is affecting the mean free path.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules get ionized or excited. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move or change their properties. Oh, because the electron beam has a high energy—1000 kV is a million volts. That's a lot of energy per electron. These electrons can strip electrons from gas atoms, creating ions. So the gas molecules
