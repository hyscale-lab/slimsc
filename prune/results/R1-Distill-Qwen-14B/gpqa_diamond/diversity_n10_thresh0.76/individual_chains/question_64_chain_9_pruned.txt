Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

So, the problem involves an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, and this causes a mixture of gases to form. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper. 

The results are that the weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60 grams and 0.80 grams respectively. Tube 2 didn't change in weight. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes and then backtrack to find out what salts A and B are, so I can count all their atoms.

Let's break down each part.

First, the setup: heating a mixture of salts A and B under no air (so no oxygen, maybe?) leads to gases. The gases pass through three tubes.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent, but in this case, it's anhydrous. So when it absorbs water, it gains mass. So, the increase in weight of 3.60g in tube 1 suggests that water (H2O) was present in the gas mixture. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water vapor to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, thereby increasing the mass of the tube.

Wait, but how much water was there? Let's think. The mass gained is 3.60g. If the gas is H2O, then the molar mass of H2O is 18g/mol. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g /18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

So tube 1 indicates 0.2 moles of H2O were present.

Next, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change, so no reaction occurred. What reactions would cause a change in weight here? Well, perhaps if CO2 gas was present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the weight didn't change, which suggests that no CO2 was present. Alternatively, if CO2 were present, the solution would gain mass as it reacted. Since there's no change, perhaps no CO2 was in the gas, or maybe it's another gas that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

Then, tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g. Red-hot copper, I think, would react with certain gases. For instance, if there's CO (carbon monoxide) present, it would react with Cu to form CO2 and CuO. Alternatively, if H2 is present, it would react with CuO (but wait, the copper is red-hot, so perhaps in the presence of H2, it would reduce CuO? Not sure. Wait, let's think.

Red hot copper in a tube: if the gas is CO, it would be oxidized. The reaction would be 2 Cu + CO → 2 CuO + C. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility is that the gas is H2S, but that's unlikely because I don't think H2S would react with red hot copper. Alternatively, if the gas is H2, which can react with CuO to form water. Wait, but wait, the tube is red-hot, so perhaps the H2 is acting as a reducing agent. Let me think about the reactions.
