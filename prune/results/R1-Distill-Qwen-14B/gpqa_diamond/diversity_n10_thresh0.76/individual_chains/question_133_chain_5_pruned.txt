Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 milliliters, right? And in this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard room temperature, I think. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^3-) in the solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? So the problem is asking for [HPO4^3-] in mol/L.

The problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. These are the dissociation constants for each step of the phosphoric acid dissociation.

So, first, I think I need to find out how much each of these salts contributes to the phosphate species in solution. Because when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they might form a buffer solution. Let me think about the reactions.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (but wait, the formula is Na2HPO4, so it's HPO4^2-). Wait, no, wait. Let me correct this. The formula is Na2HPO4. So when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, HPO4 is HPO4^3- or HPO4^2-? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think about the phosphate species.

Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can deprotonate in three steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, H2PO4^- is the first deprotonated form, HPO4^2- is the second, and PO4^3- is the third.

Now, the salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. KH2PO4 would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and H
