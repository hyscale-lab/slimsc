Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on certain criteria. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I need to figure out for each option whether the S/N meets or exceeds 10.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is on the VLT, which is a big telescope. I remember that the sensitivity of a spectrograph depends on the brightness of the star, exposure time, and the instrument's capabilities. The S/N is calculated using the formula: S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / (read noise + other noises). But for this, maybe I can think in terms of how bright the star is in terms of magnitude and its distance.

Wait, the options give some stars with specific V magnitudes and distances. Absolute magnitude is a measure of the star's intrinsic brightness. The V magnitude is the apparent brightness as seen from Earth. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude if the star were at 10 parsecs. So the apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each option, I can compute m. Then, the fainter the star (higher m), the harder it is to get a high S/N because it's dimmer.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance depends on the brightness of the star. From what I can recall, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but it's also designed to have good sensitivity, especially for bright stars. So for very bright stars, it can achieve high S/N quickly, but for faint ones, it might take longer or not reach the needed S/N.

So, the formula for calculating the signal-to-noise ratio is something like S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / (read noise), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the relation between magnitude and photon flux.

Another approach: the flux received from a star decreases with the square of the distance. So for a star at 10 pc, it's brighter than one at 50 pc by (50/10)^2 = 25 times. But the absolute magnitude is the same, so their apparent magnitudes would differ by 5 log10(50/10) = 5 log10(5) ≈ 5 * 0.69897 ≈ 3.495. So their m would be: M + 3.495 for 50 pc.

Wait, let's compute each option's apparent V magnitude.

Option a: Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star. Let me remember. Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. I think its apparent magnitude is around -0.7 or something. So m is about -0.7. That's super bright.

Option b: Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is around 2.0, I think. So m ≈ 2.

Option c: Star at 10 pc, M=15. So m = 15 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15. So m=15.

Option d: Same M=15, but distance is 200 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 log10(20) = 15 + 5*(1.3010) ≈ 15 + 6.505 = 21.505. So m≈21.5.

Option e: 5 pc, M=15. m=15 +5 log10(5/10)=15 +5 log10(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15 -1.505≈13.495. So m≈13.5.

Option f: 50 pc, M=15. m=15 +5 log10(50/10)=15 +5 log10(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.4948≈18.495. So m≈18.5.

Now, I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity is such that it can reach a certain S/N in a given exposure time for stars of a certain brightness. I remember that for a 1-hour exposure (which is 3600 seconds), the S/N depends on the star's brightness. Let's think about the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N.

The formula for S/N is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t) / noise, where m0 is some reference magnitude. Alternatively, another approach is that the S/N scales with 10^(-0.4*(m)). Wait, I think the basic idea is that each magnitude step (each 5 magnitudes) changes
