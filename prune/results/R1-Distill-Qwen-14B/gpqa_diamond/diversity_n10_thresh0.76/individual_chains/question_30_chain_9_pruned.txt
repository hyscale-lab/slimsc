Okay, so I've got this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs light, it emits the complementary color. Wait, like how if something absorbs blue, it reflects red, so the color we see is red. But the question is about the absorbed light, not what's emitted.

The question gives the energy of the emitted light as 2.3393 eV. I think I need to relate this energy to the wavelength of the emitted light. Oh right, because the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Wait, but wait, if the compound emits light when it loses energy, then the energy we're given is the energy of the emitted photon. So the wavelength corresponds to the emitted light, which is the complementary color of what's absorbed. Or is it the other way around? Let me think again.

Wait, when a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light corresponds to an electronic transition. The absorbed photon's energy promotes an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it returns to a lower energy state, it emits a photon. But the emitted photon's energy might not be the same as the absorbed one because of possible energy losses, but I think in some cases, especially in conjugated systems, maybe it's a similar energy.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. To find the wavelength, I can calculate λ = hc/E.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and speed of light c is about 3.0 x10^8 m/s. But since eV is involved, perhaps I should use the conversion factor where 1 eV corresponds to approximately 1240 eV·nm. Oh right, because hc is about 1240 eV·nm.

So E (in eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ(nm). Rearranging, λ = 1240 / E.

So plugging in E = 2.3393 eV:

λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me calculate that.

2.3393 goes into 1240 how many times? Let's see, 2.3393 * 500 is about 1169.65, which is less than 1240. 2.3393 * 530 is about 1240. Wait, 2.3393 * 530 = ?

2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65, 2.3393 * 30 = ~70.179. So together, 1169.65 +70.179 = 1239.83, which is very close to 1240. So λ ≈ 530 nm.

Wait, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. So the emitted light is green
