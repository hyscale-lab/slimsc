Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

So the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, the expectation value ⟨P_x⟩ should just be the eigenvalue, which is -ħ. But wait, no, the eigenvalue given is -ħ? Let me check the problem statement again.

Looking back, no, the eigenvalue is -ħ. So ⟨P_x⟩ = -ħ. But for uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors, which are the eigenstates of P_z. So maybe I can write the state as a linear combination of |+ħ⟩, |0⟩, and |-ħ⟩ states, and then compute the expectation values for P_z and P_z squared.

Let me look at the given state vector. It's (-1/2, 1/sqrt(
