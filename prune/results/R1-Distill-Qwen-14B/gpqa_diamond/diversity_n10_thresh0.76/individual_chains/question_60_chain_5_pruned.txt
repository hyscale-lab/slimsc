Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They have a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, which is 150 years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth.

Hmm, the key here is that the astronaut is experiencing time in their own frame of reference. So this is a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be less than the time measured in the Earth's frame.

Wait, no. Wait, because from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. So the distance they need to cover would be contracted due to length contraction. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be based on the contracted distance divided by their speed.

Let me think. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance from the LMC to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So the distance is roughly 163,000 ly.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the exact distance. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the distance is, say, the same as the LMC's distance. Wait, but the problem says "having Earth as their destination in mind." So if they're in the LMC and going to Earth, the distance would be about 163,000 ly.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, maybe that's a mistake on my part. Let me check the problem again. Oh, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, so almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find the time from their perspective.

Wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective, so how much time passes for them. So the time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the shortest possible time. Because in their frame, Earth is moving towards them, so the distance is contracted.

So the time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is equal to the contracted distance (d') divided by the speed (v
