Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different combinations for A and B.

Let me start by recalling what I know about these reactions. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), it's a nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, but ketones have a carbonyl group. Maybe it's an addition reaction. Oh right, the addition of cyanide to ketones can form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a nitrile group adds to the carbonyl, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol.

So the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But wait, how is this achieved? I think the mechanism involves the attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, which then gets protonated.

But for that to happen, the solution probably needs to be acidic. Because without enough acid, the CN- might not be the dominant species. Oh, right, in the presence of an acid, the reaction can proceed. So maybe Reagent A is an acid. Because the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A. So A is probably a proton source, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, maybe) or something else.

Wait, but NaCN is a strong base, so maybe it's not necessary to have a strong acid. Or perhaps the acid is needed to protonate the oxygen to make the carbonyl more electrophilic, making the attack by CN- easier. So the first reagent A is likely H3O+.

So looking at the options, for reagent A, options A and B have H3O+, while C and D have NaHS
