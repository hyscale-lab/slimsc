Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Oh right, chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So if a molecule has at least one chiral center, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

Let me look at the compounds given and see which ones have chiral centers. There are four compounds numbered 1 to 4, and the options are combinations of them. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. It's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups on the 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups on 2 and 2' positions. Also, it's a dimethyl ester, so the carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methanol. 

I'm trying to imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. The question is, does this create any chiral centers? Well, the central single bond between the two rings allows for rotation. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that their positions create a chiral center in the connecting C-C bond or elsewhere.

Wait, but each benzene ring is connected to the central carbon, which I think is the single bond between the two benzene rings. So the structure is like two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each ring having substituents. Let's see: on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 have substituents. So each benzene has a nitro (maybe at position 6) and a carboxylate ester (position 2). 

Wait, the central carbon is the one connecting the two benzene rings. So each of the two benzene rings is attached to that central carbon. So the central carbon has two benzene rings attached, each with their substituents. Let's think: the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, but wait, each phenyl is part of the biphenyl structure. So the central carbon is actually the point where the two benzene rings are connected.

Wait, but the central carbon is the one that's part of both rings. Oh, wait no, in biphenyl, it's a single bond connecting two benzene rings. So the structure is benzene-Ph-Ph-benzene? No, more accurately, two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each benzene ring has substituents at certain positions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether there's a chiral center. The central single bond allows for free rotation unless there's steric hindrance. If the molecule can't rotate, perhaps because of bulky groups, it could have a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate groups. Nitro is a strong EWG, carboxylate is a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the mirror image is non-superimposable. Wait, but biphenyl's single bond usually allows for free rotation, so unless the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, maybe each of the two benzene rings has substituents that create a chiral center on their own. Let's think about the substituents on each benzene ring. For instance, the 2 and 6 positions are nitro and ester groups. Suppose each benzene ring has a nitro group (e.g., at position 6) and a carboxylate ester (position 2). Then each benzene ring would have substituents in positions 2 and 6. But benzene is symmetric, so having substituents in positions 2 and 6 (which are para to each other) would not create a chiral center on the benzene itself. Because benzene is flat, so any substituents would be in a plane.

Wait, maybe the substituents are on the same or opposite sides, leading to a possibility of E or Z isomerism, but wait, that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. But the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So maybe this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because all the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are flat. So I'm thinking compound 1 doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is it an option in some of the choices? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is the point where the two benzene rings are connected. If the substituents on each benzene ring are arranged such that the central carbon has four different groups, then that could be a chiral center. Wait, the central carbon is part of both benzene rings? No, actually, the biphenyl is connected via a single bond between the two benzene rings. But in biphenyl, each benzene is a separate ring, and the central bond is a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the overall molecule chiral. For instance, if the two substituents on each benzene ring are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. But I'm not sure. Let me think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then it won't have a chiral center. But if they're not, perhaps it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are such that the arrangement around the central bond leads to a chiral center. Wait, but the central bond is a single bond between two carbons that are each part of benzene rings. So each of those carbons is bonded to two phenyl groups and perhaps another substituent? Or wait, maybe the central carbon is actually a carbon that's part of both rings, but that's more like naphthalene, which is a fused ring system, but in biphenyl, the rings are connected by a single bond, so each is a benzene ring attached to a central carbon.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is the point where two benzene rings are attached. So the structure is like benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene
