Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor is given as about 20. So, the average scenario is that one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma (γ), is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma is significant.

Wait, so the detector is a sphere with radius 30 meters. So, the maximum distance a particle could travel before hitting the detector is 30 meters, right? Because if the particle is moving in any direction, it can't go beyond that radius.

But particles are produced at the center, so they have to travel a distance that's less than or equal to 30 meters to reach the walls.

Now, the particles are moving at a velocity v, and they decay quickly. So, the fraction that reaches the detector walls depends on how far they can travel before decaying. The problem says that for gamma =20, only one third reach the walls. So, when gamma increases, I think the particles can travel further because their lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The proper lifetime of the particle is tau (τ). The dilated lifetime is gamma * tau. So, the particles that reach the detector walls must have a dilated lifetime sufficient to travel the 30 meters before decaying.

So, the average distance a particle travels before decaying would be v multiplied by the time it lives, which is gamma * tau. So, distance d = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, for the decay process, the mean lifetime is tau, so the average lifetime from the lab frame is gamma*tau. So, the average distance each particle travels is v * gamma * tau.

But wait, in the problem statement, when gamma is 20, only one
