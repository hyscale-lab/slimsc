Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Let's see what the potential looks like.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance and θ is the angle. So the potential has two terms: one that's purely radial (only depends on r) and another that depends on both r and θ because of the cos²θ term.

Wait, the first term is (1/2)kr². That looks familiar. I think that's like a harmonic oscillator potential, but in two dimensions. Because in one dimension, V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x² is the harmonic oscillator potential. So in two dimensions, if the potential is V(r) = (1/2) k r², that's a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator, right? Because the potential is the same in all directions.

But then there's the second term: (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think about how that affects the system. The cos²θ term suggests that the potential varies with the angle. Because cos²θ is symmetric in the sense that it depends on θ, but has a maximum when θ=0 or π, and minimum at θ=π/2.

Wait, but when you have a potential that depends on θ, that can affect the angular part of the Schrödinger equation. So this is probably a perturbation or maybe the potential isn't separable in the usual way. Or perhaps it can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or other operators.

Alternatively, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So maybe cos²θ can be converted into terms involving x and y.

Wait, cos²θ is ( (x/r) )², right? So cos²θ = x² / r². So the second term becomes (3/2) k r² * (x² / r²) )= (3/2) k x². Oh! So the potential can be
