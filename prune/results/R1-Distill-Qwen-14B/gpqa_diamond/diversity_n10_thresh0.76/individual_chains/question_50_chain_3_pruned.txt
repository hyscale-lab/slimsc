Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I need to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process and the type of terms you get from calculating it. Each loop typically contributes a factor that involves integrals, and these integrals often lead to things like log divergences or factors of 1/(4π)^something.

Looking at the expression given: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

I think the key here is to analyze the power of (4π) in the denominator. Because each loop in a Feynman diagram usually introduces a factor of 1/(4π)^d, where d is the number of dimensions, but wait, no, actually, in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral typically gives a factor of 1/(4π)^2. Or wait, maybe per loop? Or perhaps it's more about the number of loop integrations.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Feynman diagrams with L loops contribute terms proportional to (some coupling constants) multiplied by factors like (1/(4π)^{L*(number of dimensions?)}). Wait, no, maybe each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^2 for each loop in four-dimensional spacetime. Because the loop integral in four dimensions would have a 4π from the volume of the sphere (like the integral over d^4k includes a (4π)^2 from spherical coordinates in 4D? Or maybe (4π)^{d/2} for d dimensions, but we're in d=4, so (4π)^2 per loop.)

Wait, wait, I think I remember that for each loop, you get a factor of (1/(4π)^{2L}) because each loop has an integral that brings in (4π)^2, but since it's an integral in four dimensions, perhaps each loop contributes 1/(4π)^2. So for L loops, the total would be (1/(4π)^{2L}).

Looking back at the given expression, the denominator is (4
