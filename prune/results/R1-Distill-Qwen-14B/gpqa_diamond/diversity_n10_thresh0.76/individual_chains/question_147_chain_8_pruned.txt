Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, different fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, I should probably start by understanding what's going on here. In particle physics, annihilation typically refers to the process where particles and their antiparticles annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy. But in this case, the reaction produces two particles of each A+ and A−. So it's not just annihilation into photons but into other particles.

The antiproton is moving slowly, which probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate it as being at rest? Or perhaps it's moving, but not too fast, so relativistic effects aren't too severe. I'm not sure yet.

The given mass energy for A is 300 MeV. I'm probably going to need to use conservation laws here—either conservation of energy or conservation of momentum. Since the process involves both protons and antiprotons, and the products are these A particles, I should think about what each particle's rest mass is.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they're matter and antimatter. So each has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV. So in the initial state, before annihilation, the total rest mass energy is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass. So perhaps I can approximate the initial energy as just the sum of the rest masses. But wait, when particles collide, the rest mass of the products depends on the available energy. Hmm.

Wait, the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So four particles in the end. Each A has mass 300 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products would be 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But
