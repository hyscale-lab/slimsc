Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². So, the force is Hookean, like a spring. The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Or wait, is it the sum of the radial quantum numbers? Wait, no, in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n, which is related to the radial part, but for the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, I think the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers for each direction.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the quantum numbers. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ℏω, so adding all three gives (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But wait, sometimes the principal quantum number is considered as n = n_r + l, where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. However, in the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on n = n_x + n_y + n_z, which is the same as n = 2n_r + l. So the energy levels are equally spaced in steps of ℏω.

The energy levels for the 3D oscillator are E_n = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). Each n corresponds to a certain energy level. But wait, what defines each state? The principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Let me think about what the "excited states" mean. The ground state is the lowest energy, so it's the first state. The first excited state is the next one, then the second, and so on.

Wait, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. Each energy level corresponds to multiple states with different quantum numbers but the same n.

So, the ground state is n=0, first excited state n=1, second excited state n=2, third excited state n=3.

So for n=3, the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ℏω = (9/2) ℏω. Let me double-check that. Yeah, 3 comes from n=3, plus 3/2, so (3 + 1.5) = 4.5, which
