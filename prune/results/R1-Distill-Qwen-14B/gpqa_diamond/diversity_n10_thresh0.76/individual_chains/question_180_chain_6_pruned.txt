Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it through. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of charges. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the system has 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And the mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so I think that means energy is conserved and no work is done by external forces.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, so they're fixed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P. And the 13th charge is fixed right at P. So the setup is that one charge is at the center, and the other twelve are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position against the electric field of the others. Since all the charges are the same, maybe there's a formula for that.

Wait, but wait a second. Each of the twelve charges is at 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is at the center. Let me think: the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since it's a lot of charges, that's a lot of terms. But maybe because all are identical, there's a formula to compute this more easily.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy for a configuration of point charges can be calculated as (1/2) times the number of pairs times the potential energy for each pair. Since each pair is identical.

Wait, but if you have n charges at a point, the potential energy of each charge would be the sum of the potentials due to all others. But in this case, one is at the center, and others are on the sphere. Maybe I can split the problem into two parts: the potential energy between the central charge and the twelve on the sphere, and the potential energy between the twelve charges themselves.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of U1 (central charge and each of the 12) plus U2
