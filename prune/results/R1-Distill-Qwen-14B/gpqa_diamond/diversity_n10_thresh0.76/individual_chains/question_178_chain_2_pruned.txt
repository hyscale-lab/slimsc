Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the Lagrangian of a certain interaction and determining whether the coupling constant has a specific mass dimension and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. But I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. So, σ_{μν} is a antisymmetric tensor of rank 2, but more importantly, it's a product of gamma matrices, which are themselves spinor matrices.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. In quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is determined by ensuring that the entire term has mass dimension 4, since the Lagrangian density has to have mass dimension 4 (because when integrated over four-volume, it gives action which is dimensionless in natural units).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let's look at each component of the term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let me list the mass dimensions of each component:

- ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation has to have the right dimension. The kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ has dimension (4 - [i γ ∂ ψ] )? Wait, wait. Let me think: the kinetic term is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. Each ψ has dimension d. ∂_μ has dimension 1. So the term would have dimensions: [ψ̄] is [d], [γ^μ] is dimensionless, [∂_μ] is 1, [ψ] is d. So the whole term is d + 1 + d = 2d +1 = 4. So 2d +1 =4 → 2d =3 → d=3/2. So yes, ψ has dimension 3/2.

- ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

- σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Each γ matrix is dimensionless (since they're just matrices). So [σ_{μν}] is dimensionless.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for, I think, a gauge field like electromagnetism or another abelian field. The field strength F is made from the field derivatives. For example, F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative brings dimension 1. So the dimension of A is [A] = [F] - 1? Wait, wait, because F is made from derivatives of A. Let me think: [F^{μν}] = [∂ A] = [∂] [A]. So [F] = 1 + [A]. But what's the dimension of A?

Wait, A is a gauge field, which is a vector field. So in four dimensions, a vector field A^μ has mass dimension 1. Because the term in the Lagrangian like (∂ A)^2 would have dimension (1 +1) * 2 = 4, so when multiplied by the field, it's dimension 4. Wait, let me get back. The gauge field A^μ has dimension 1. So F^{μν} has dimension [∂ A] = 1 +1 =2.

So putting it all together:

The term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each part's dimension:

κ → [κ]

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ_{μν} → 0

ψ → 3/2

F^{μν} → 2

Multiply all together: [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3/2 *2) + 2 = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Wait, but that would
