Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties of each state, then the lines are far apart enough.

Alternatively, another approach: The energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty principle. The minimum energy difference that can be distinguished is about the uncertainty in energy. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, it's resolvable.

Wait, but in this case, the two states have different lifetimes. So each has their own uncertainty. So the combined uncertainty would be... Hmm, maybe we should consider the minimum between the two uncertainties?

Wait, no. Each state has its own ΔE. So for E1, ΔE1 is ħ/(2 τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2).

So if the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then we can resolve them.

So let me compute these uncertainties.

First, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert this into eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s ≈ 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-19 eV·s ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for state 1, τ1 = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) eV.

Calculating that: 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, τ2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, that's a big difference because τ2 is longer, so ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

So now, the energy difference between E2 and E1, ΔE = E2 - E1, should be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2 to be resolved.

Because if ΔE is much larger than either, each state's energy is well-defined relative to the other.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is much smaller than ΔE1 (3.29e-7), so this is too small. Can't resolve.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → way too small.

Option C:1
