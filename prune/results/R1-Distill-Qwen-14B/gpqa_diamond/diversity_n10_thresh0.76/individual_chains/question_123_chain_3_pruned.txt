Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. But we need to calculate the distance in the galaxy's frame. Hmm, I think this has to do with relative velocity and maybe time dilation because of special relativity. Oh right, since both are inertial frames, we can use the Lorentz transformations or at least the velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me think. Let's denote the galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. In S', the galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. But wait, actually, the velocity of the galaxy as seen from the ejecta's frame is v = +60,000 km/s. But wait, direction matters. Since the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity would be opposite. Right, so the velocity in the galaxy's frame
