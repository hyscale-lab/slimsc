Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical scenario where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. But wait, in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. So if in this universe they can, that must change some of Maxwell's equations.

I think about each of Maxwell's four equations. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field. Oh wait, that's related to electric charge. The equation says that the divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero. I don't think that equation would change because it's about charges, not magnetic poles. So that's probably the same.

The second equation is about the curl of E. I remember that the curl of E is related to the time derivative of the magnetic field. The equation is curl E = -dB/dt. But wait, that's in our universe because changing magnetic fields create electric fields. If in this universe magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect this equation? I'm not so sure. Maybe not directly, because the existence of monopoles affects the divergence, not the curl, of the magnetic field.

Wait, the third equation is the divergence of B. Oh right, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero because there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. So Maxwell's equation says div B = 0. But in this scenario, magnets can have isolated poles, so div B wouldn't be zero anymore. Oh, so that equation must change. So that's one equation that's different.

What about the fourth equation, the curl of B? That's Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. It relates the curl of B to the current plus the displacement current. So in our universe, the equation is curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. But if magnetic monopoles exist, would that change anything? Hmm, I think if there are magnetic currents, then perhaps the curl of B would involve those. But the question is about which of Maxwell's equations are different. Wait, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero, but the curl of B includes the displacement current.

But if magnetic monopoles exist, what happens? Maxwell's equations would have to be modified to account for magnetic charge. So, in our universe, we have divergence of B equals zero, and divergence of E equals rho/epsilon_0. If there are magnetic monopoles, then perhaps divergence of B would equal some magnetic rho (like rho_m) over a constant. Similarly, the other equations might get terms involving magnetic current.

Wait, but the original Maxwell equations in our universe are:

1. div E = rho / epsilon_0
2. curl E = -dB/dt
3. div B = 0
4. curl B = mu_0 J + epsilon_0 mu_0 dE/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 3 would become something like div B = rho_m / mu_0, similar to how equation 1 has rho. Also, the curl equations might change. Wait, in our universe, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B, and the curl of B is related to the current and displacement current. But if there are magnetic currents, perhaps equation 4 would have another term.

Wait, I think when magnetic monopoles are present, the modified Maxwell equations would have both divergence of E and divergence of B related to their respective charges. Also, the curl equations would have additional terms for magnetic current and displacement. So for example:

div E = rho / epsilon_0
div B = rho_m / mu_0
curl E = - dB/dt - J_m / epsilon_0
curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + something involving J_m?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In the standard equations, there's no magnetic charge or current. If we introduce magnetic monopoles, the equations would mirror the electric ones.

So, for the magnetic field B, its divergence would now relate to the presence of magnetic monopoles. So equation 3 would change. And, perhaps, the curl of E would have a term involving magnetic current. Let me think about the symmetrized Maxwell equations when monopoles exist.

Wait, I remember that when magnetic monopoles are present, the equations become symmetric. So that the form of the equations for E and B become similar. So, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, and the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, in our universe, equation 2 is curl E = - dB/dt. If magnetic monopoles can exist, perhaps equation 2 would have an additional term for magnetic current.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The question is, which equation would be different. The options are about which equations are altered.

In our universe, the equations are:

1. div E = rho / epsilon_0 (electric charge)
2. curl E = - dB/dt (no sources on the right)
3. div B = 0 (no magnetic charge)
4. curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt (includes displacement current)

If in this universe, there are isolated magnetic poles, then equation 3 would change to div B = some constant times rho_m, the magnetic charge density. So equation 3 is definitely different.

What about equation 2? If there are magnetic currents, like a current made of moving magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 might have a term involving J_m (magnetic current). But wait, equation 2 is curl E = - dB/dt. Or, perhaps, in this case, equation 2 would have a term like J_m. Hmm.

Wait, I think another way to think about it is, the existence of magnetic monopoles would require that the divergence of B is non-zero. So equation 3 would change. But what about the other equations?

In standard Maxwell, equation 2 is about the curl of E, which is only dependent on the time derivative of B. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect equation 2? Or would that affect equation 4?

Wait, perhaps equation 4, the curl of B, would need to include magnetic current terms. Because in our universe, equation 4 is curl B = mu_0 ( J + epsilon_0 dE/dt ). If there's a magnetic current J_m, then equation 4 would have an additional term, like J_m, similar to how J is in equation 4.

Wait, but then equation 4 would change. So, which equations are different?

The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations are different. So in the universe where magnetic monopoles exist, equations 3 and 4 would change, because equation 3 would have a divergence, and equation 4 would have an additional term for magnetic current.

Wait, but does equation 2 (curl E) change? In our universe, equation 2 is curl E = -dB/dt. If in this universe, magnetic monopoles exist, would equation 2 change? Because equation 2 relates the electric field to the time derivative of the magnetic field, regardless of sources.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again. The existence of magnetic monopoles would change equation 3 (div B) and equation 4 (curl B). Because equation 4 would have an additional term for the magnetic current.

Wait, but if the divergence of B is non-zero, how does that affect the other equations? Let me think of a scenario where div B is non-zero. Then, for example, in equation 2, curl E is related to the time derivative of B. But I don't think that equation 2 itself would change, unless there's a magnetic current.

Ah, perhaps equation 2 would also change. Because in the standard case, equation 2 is only about the time change of B. But if there are moving magnetic charges (i.e., magnetic currents), then the equation would have an additional term. So equation 2 would become curl E = - dB/dt - J_m, or something like that.

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on that. Let me try to look it up in my mind. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations are modified to:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / mu_0
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m / epsilon_0
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + J_m

Wait, is that right? Wait, I think the curl E equation would include a term involving the magnetic current. So equation 2 (curl E) would have an extra term. So, equations 2 and 3 would change. Equation 3, of course, because div B isn't zero anymore. Equation 2 would also change because of the magnetic current.

Wait, but I'm not sure about equation 4. If equation 4 already includes the displacement current for the electric field, would it need to include something for magnetic displacement? Or maybe not, because equation 4 is about the curl of B. Wait, in the standard case, equation 4 is curl B equals the sum of the conduction current and displacement current. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m, the magnetic current.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure. The equations would be symmetric. So if equation 1 is about the divergence of E and electric charge, equation 2 would be about the curl of E and magnetic monopole current. Similarly, equation 3 is about the divergence of B and magnetic charge, and equation 4 is about the curl of B and electric current plus displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current, just like the curl of B has a term involving the electric current. So, equation 2 would change to include J_m. And equation 3 would change to include rho_m.

Similarly, equation 4 would include J_e and displacement current, and perhaps an additional term for J_m? Or maybe equation 4 remains the same. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: in standard Maxwell's equations, Ampère's law (equation 4) includes the displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps Faraday's law (equation 2) would include a displacement term, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the modified equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m
3. div B = rho_m / mu_0
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

Wait, but in equation 2, J_m would have to be scaled by some constants. In our universe, equation 2 is curl E = -dB/dt. So in the universe with monopoles, it would include an additional term, perhaps J_m multiplied by a constant. So equation 2 would change.

So, in the question, which equations are different? The question gives options about which equations are altered.

The options are:

A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 3, which changes. So A is possible.

B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equations 2 and 3. So B would be possible.

C) The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field. Hmm, flux of E? I'm not sure. Wait, flux is more about integral of E dot dA, which is charge. Not sure what 'flux of the electric field' refers to. So maybe C isn't correct.

D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equations 3 and 4. Because equation 3 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B.

Wait, wait. So in our universe, equation 4 is curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. So if magnetic monopoles exist, would equation 4 change? Because equation 4 would have a term involving J_m or something else? Or perhaps equation 4 remains the same, but equation 2 and 3 change.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think again. The original question is in a universe where a magnet can have isolated poles, so Maxwell's equations are different. Which equations?

In our universe, equation 3 is div B = 0. But with isolated poles, equation 3 becomes div B = something (like rho_m / mu_0), so equation 3 changes.

Equation 2 in our universe is curl E = -dB/dt. But if there's a magnetic current, then equation 2 would have an additional term, like curl E = -dB/dt - J_m. So equation 2 changes as well.

Equation 4 in our universe is curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. If there are magnetic monopoles, does equation 4 change? I'm not sure. Because equation 4 deals with the sources of the B field, which in our case are currents. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps equation 4 would have a term involving J_m. But wait, equation 4 is about the curl of B, which in our universe is due to J (electric current) and displacement current. If magnetic current exists, perhaps equation 4 would have an additional term, making it different.

So, equations 2,3,4 would change? Hmm, but that's not one of the options. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So that's equations 3 and 4.

But wait, in our analysis, equation 2 also changes. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 2) and divergence of B (equation 3).

So in that case, which option is correct?

Option B: The ones related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

So, equation 2 and 3 change.

Wait, but wait. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would also change, perhaps. Because equation 4 is the Ampère's law. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps they would contribute to the curl of B. So equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, but equation 4 is about the curl of B, which in our universe is due to electric currents and displacement. If magnetic currents exist, equation 4 would include a term for J_m. So equation 4 would change.

So then, equations 2,3,4 would all change. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. Only equation 3 changes.

B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. Equations 2 and 3 change.

C) The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.

D) The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. Equations 3 and 4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, equations 3 and perhaps 2 and 4 would change. But the options don't have an option that includes all three. So perhaps I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 would not change because the curl of B is about the sources of B, which in standard physics are currents. If magnetic monopoles exist, the sources are different, but perhaps equation 4's form remains the same, with the same terms.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the symmetrized Maxwell equations. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations are made symmetric so that the mathematical structure mirrors that of electric charges.

So, the four equations become:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / mu_0
3. curl E = - (dB/dt) - J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 ( J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt )

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The standard equations are modified as follows when magnetic monopoles are present:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / mu_0
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m / epsilon_0
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + J_m * epsilon_0 ?

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think of the structure.

In our universe, equation 2 is curl E = - dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current J_m, then Faraday's law would have a term involving J_m. So it would become curl E = - dB/dt - (J_m)/epsilon_0, similar to how in Ampère's law, the displacement current is epsilon_0 dE/dt.

Wait, perhaps equation 3 is the only equation that changes. Because in our universe, equation 3 is div B = 0. With monopoles, equation 3 changes. Equation 2 would have an extra term, making it different.

So which equations are different? Equations 2 and 3.

Looking at the options, option B says the ones related to the circulation of the electric field (equation 2) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 3).

So, the correct answer would be option B.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct if equation 4 changes as well. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, equation 4 would not change because it deals with the sources of the B field from electric currents, not magnetic ones. Or does it?

Wait, equation 4 is about the curl of B, which in our universe is linked to the sum of the conduction current and displacement current. But if magnetic monopoles exist, would the curl of B be different? I'm not certain. But I think equation 4 wouldn't change because it's about the sources of B from electric currents. The existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't directly change how B is sourced by electric currents.

But equation 2 (curl E) would change because the presence of magnetic currents would affect the electric field's curl. So equation 2 would have an additional term.

So, the equations that change are:

- Equation 2: curl E (has J_m term)
- Equation 3: divergence of B (non-zero)
- Equation 4: perhaps not, unless there's a term for J_m.

Wait, but in the symmetrized equations, equation 4 would have a term for J_m. So equation 4 would change as well.

So that would mean equations 2, 3, and 4 change, but that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think of the Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles. The equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = rho_m / mu_0
3. curl E = - (dB/dt) - (J_m) / epsilon_0
4. curl B = mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 (dE/dt) + J_m

Wait, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 becomes:

curl B = mu_0 ( J_e + epsilon_0 dE/dt ) + J_m

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, and only equations 2 and 3 change.

If that's the case, then the equations that change are 2 and 3, making option B correct.

Because the question is about which equations are different, and with the presence of monopoles, equations 2 and 3 change.


In a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, Maxwell’s equations must be modified to account for the existence of magnetic monopoles. In our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, and this leads to specific forms of Maxwell’s equations. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the following changes occur:

1. **Equation 3 (Divergence of the Magnetic Field)**: In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, i.e., $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$, because there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. With the existence of magnetic monopoles, this equation changes to $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m / \mu_0$, where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density. This is a direct consequence of the presence of magnetic monopoles.

2. **Equation 2 (Curl of the Electric Field)**: In our universe, the curl of the electric field is given by $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\partial \mathbf{B}/\partial t$. With magnetic monopoles, an additional term arises due to magnetic currents. The modified equation becomes $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\partial \mathbf{B}/\partial t - \mathbf{J}_m / \epsilon_0$, where $\mathbf{J}_m$ is the magnetic current density. This reflects the influence of magnetic currents on the electric field.

3. **Equation 4 (Curl of the Magnetic Field)**: In our universe, the curl of the magnetic field is given by $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial \mathbf{E}/\partial t$. While the existence of magnetic monopoles might introduce additional terms in this equation, such as a term involving $\mathbf{J}_m$, the question does not explicitly indicate that this equation changes. Therefore, it is reasonable to focus on the changes to equations 2 and 3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: "The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field."  
  This refers only to equation 3, which does change. However, equation 2 also changes due to the presence of magnetic currents, so this option is incomplete.

- **Option B**: "The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field."  
  This correctly identifies that equations 2 and 3 are altered. Equation 2 changes due to magnetic currents, and equation 3 changes due to the existence of magnetic monopoles.

- **Option C**: "The ones related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field."  
  This is incorrect because the flux of the electric field is not directly affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles. Additionally, the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) does not necessarily change in this scenario.

- **Option D**: "The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field."  
  This refers to equations 3 and 4. While equation 3 changes, there is no clear indication that equation 4 changes in this scenario. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as both the circulation of the electric field (equation 2) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 3) are altered in a universe with isolated magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B
