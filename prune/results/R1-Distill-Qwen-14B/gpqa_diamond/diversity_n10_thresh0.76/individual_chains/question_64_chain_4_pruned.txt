Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out.

So the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams total. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, after all this, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temp and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me think about what each part does. The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. But when it's anhydrous, it can react with water or maybe other moisture. So when gases pass through, if they carry water vapor, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. So tube 1 gaining 3.60g suggests that it absorbed 3.60g of H2O. So the gas mixture must have contained water vapor.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. That's a solution of calcium hydroxide, which would react with carbon dioxide. If the gas mixture had CO2, it would be absorbed here. But the problem states that the weight of the second tube didn't change, which means no CO2 was present. So the gas mixture after the first tube (after removing H2O) didn't have CO2. But wait, wait. Wait, what about before the first tube? The initial gas mixture might have had both H2O and other gases. The Mg(ClO4)2 would capture the H2O, but any CO2 would go into the second tube. But since the second tube didn't change, there's no CO2 in the gas mixture. So this tells me that the original gases didn't have CO2, or perhaps only H2O was removed, and no CO2 was present.

The third tube is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. For instance, CO2 would react at high temperatures to form CuO and carbon. Alternatively, sulfur dioxide or other gases might react, but I'm not sure. Wait, if the third tube is red-hot copper, perhaps the gas is H2S? Because H2S would react with hot copper to form CuS and water, but wait, in the presence of O2 maybe? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a reducing gas like H2 or CO. Another possibility is that the third tube is for absorbing oxygen or another gas. But the problem mentions that CuO is formed in tube 3, so the reaction is probably with CO. Because CO can be oxidized by copper(II) oxide at high temperatures. Wait, wait, no—if the copper is red-hot, maybe the gas is CO, which reacts with CuO to form Cu and CO2. But wait, if the copper is in a tube, perhaps it's used to remove CO from the gas.

Wait, let me think again. The third tube is red-hot copper, and the result is that 0.80g of CuO is formed. So perhaps the gas is CO. When CO reacts with CuO at high temperature, it forms Cu and CO2. The reaction is: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2.

So the amount of CuO formed is 0.80g. Let's calculate how much CO reacted.

The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is about 63.55, O is 16). So 0.80g / 80 g/mol = 0.01 mol. So
