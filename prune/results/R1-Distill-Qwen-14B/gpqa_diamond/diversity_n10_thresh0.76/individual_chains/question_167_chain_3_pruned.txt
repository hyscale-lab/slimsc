Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. 

The state given is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Wait, N is the normalization constant. Oh right, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). I think I've seen similar forms before, where you combine coherent states with different phases.

The question asks about the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The measure they're using is the relative entropy, which is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. 

But wait, how do I calculate this? I remember that for a pure state, the von Neumann entropy is -trace(rho ln rho). But here, the relative entropy is the difference between the entropy of rho and tau. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference in entropies between the state and the reference Gaussian state.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out what the reference Gaussian state is. Since the state given is a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state could be a thermal state or a coherent state, but I'm not exactly sure. I think that for the relative entropy of entanglement, sometimes a maximally mixed state is used, but perhaps here it's a Gaussian state that's the closest to the given state. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the closest Gaussian approximation to the given state.

Wait, but maybe in this case, when the state is a cat state, the reference Gaussian state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments. Because for Gaussian states, the density matrix is determined by the first and second moments (the mean and covariance matrix). So perhaps the reference Gaussian state has the same first and second moments as the given state.

Let me think about the given state. It's a superposition of |alpha> and |−alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi
