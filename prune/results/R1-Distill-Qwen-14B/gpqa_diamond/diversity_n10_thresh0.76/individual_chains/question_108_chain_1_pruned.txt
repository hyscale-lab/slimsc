Okay, so I've got this physics problem about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and it's given that B is 1 Tesla. Oh wait, and m is small, which probably refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -1, 0, +1, etc., depending on the orbital. But since it's small, maybe it's just zero or maybe we're considering s-orbitals where l=0, so m=0.

Wait, paramagnetic coupling... I think that refers to the Zeeman effect, where an atom's energy levels are split by an external magnetic field. The paramagnetic term is the energy due to the magnetic interaction. So the Hamiltonian for this is probably the Zeeman term, which is H = -μ·B. And μ is the magnetic moment, which for electrons is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * m_s, but wait, that's for spin magnetic moment. Oh wait, wait—no, in the Zeeman effect, it's the orbital magnetic moment that's considered, right? Or is this the spin-orbit coupling? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the problem mentions paramagnetic coupling. Paramagnetism arises from the electron's spin, so perhaps the coupling here is spin-based. So the magnetic moment would be due to spin. So for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ = -g_s * μ_B * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. And the energy would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the z-component is what matters. So H = -μ_z B.

But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, which is different from m_s (the spin magnetic quantum number). Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: in the Zeeman effect, the orbital contribution is H = (eB/(2m)) * L·B. But for paramagnetism, it's the spin part that's considered, so H = (μ_0/4π) * something... no, I might be mixing the formulas.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is often given by the Zeeman term for the spin part. So the energy is H = -μ·B, where μ is the spin magnetic moment. So the spin magnetic moment is μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. For electrons, γ is something like -e/(2m_e) * g_s, with g_s being the gyromagnetic factor, about 2. So the energy would be H = -μ · B = γ e/(2m_e) * m_s * B, but wait, maybe I should express it in terms of the Bohr magneton.

Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e). So for spin, the magnetic moment is μ = g_s μ_B m_s / ħ. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular momentum. Spin angular momentum S is ħ m_s for each spin state. So the magnetic moment μ is proportional to S, so μ = γ S. For electrons, γ is (g_e μ_B)/ħ, because μ = g_e μ_B (m_s). So that would make the energy H = -μ · B = -g_e μ_B m_s B.

So the expectation value <H> would be (since the magnetic field is along Oz, and m_s is the quantum number) H = -g_e μ_B m
