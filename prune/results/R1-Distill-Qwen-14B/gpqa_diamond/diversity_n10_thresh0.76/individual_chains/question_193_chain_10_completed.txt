Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula given must be N ∝ 1/plx^5. Or wait, wait, maybe more accurately, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1 divided by the parallax (plx) raised to the fifth power. So N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant.

But wait, parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So parallax (in parsecs) equals 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

So if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. Let me write that down. So 1/plx = r, meaning plx = 1/r. So I can substitute plx in terms of r.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx = 1/r into that gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let me compute that denominator: (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1/(1/r^5) is r^5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. So that makes N proportional to r^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the setup again. The problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So for each star, or for a given region, the number depends inversely on the parallax to the fifth power.

But how does this translate into the number of stars per unit distance? Because when we look at a range of distances, the number of stars in that range would depend on how that number varies with distance.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform density of stars. So the number would be proportional to r² dr. But wait, in this case, the number isn't directly proportional to r²; it's governed by the given relation, which is N proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, perhaps I need to express N as a function of r. So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, wait a second, that can't be right because if N increases with r^5, that would mean more stars at larger distances, which doesn't make sense because stars are more concentrated in the galaxy's plane, and at larger distances (like outside the galaxy), there might be fewer. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is varying with distance. So if the number density (stars per unit volume) is given by something like 1/plx^5, then substituting plx =1/r gives number density as proportional to r^5. But wait, number density is N per volume, so the number in a volume would be number density times volume. So total number in some region would be N = (number density) × (volume). If the number density is proportional to r^5, then the number in a thin shell might be different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the differential, the change in N with respect to r. Or maybe it's the number per unit distance, like the number of stars you'd expect to find between r and r + dr.

Wait, let me think again. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx =1/r, N ∝ r^5. So for a given distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But wait, when we talk about how the number changes with distance, we're probably looking for dN/dr, the rate of change of N with r. But if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4.

Wait, but the options don't include r^4 as a possible answer. Let me check the options again. Option C is r^4, so that's a possibility. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change of N with r (dN/dr) would be 5k r^4, so yes, that's r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (or the change per unit r) would be proportional to r^4. So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misread. The problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx =1/r, that's N ∝ r^5. So for a region of the sky (a given solid angle), the number of stars at a distance r is proportional to r^5. But as r increases, r^5 increases, so more stars are seen at larger distances. That doesn't make much sense in real terms, but perhaps the question is theoretical.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps the question is referring to the number of stars per unit distance (like in a small range dr around r). So the number of stars at distance r is N(r) = k * r^5. So the number of stars in a small shell dr thick at r would be dN = (dN/dr) dr = (5k r^4) dr. So dN is proportional to r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per dr) increases as r^4. So this would correspond to option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial assumption might be that the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to r^5. But when you look at a thin shell, the volume is 4πr^2 dr. So if the number density is n(r) = N / Volume, but I'm not sure that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to r^5. So the number density is n(r) = k r^5. Then the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is n(r) * (4π r² dr) = k r^5 * 4π r² dr = 4π k r^7 dr. So the number of stars in each shell increases with r^7, which is even higher than r^5. But that doesn't match any of the options given.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is simply asking about N as a function of r, given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars varies as r^5. So when r increases by a factor, N increases by the fifth power. But the question is asking how the number changes with distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number increases by r^5. But wait, the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?".

Wait, perhaps it's the differential. So the change in N per unit change in r is dN/dr. If N = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4. So the correct option is C, which is r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says the number varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N = k / plx^5. Since plx =1/r, N = k r^5. So per unit distance, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So the number increases as r^5, which would make the answer B. But wait, the options are: A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2.

Wait, but maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit volume. Because the initial statement says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So if you imagine that the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to 1/plx^5, then substituting plx =1/r, number density is proportional to r^5. Then the number of stars in a volume would be number density multiplied by volume. So for a thin shell, the number would be number_density × 4π r² dr = r^5 × 4π r² dr = 4π r^7 dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell at r is proportional to r^7, which is even higher. But that doesn't match any of the options given.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. They just want to know the dependence of the number of stars on distance, given that N ∝ 1/plx^5. So since plx =1/r, N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases as r^5. So the correct answer would be option B, which is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps the number of stars per unit distance is N/(dr) = (k r^5)/dr. But that would suggest that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^5, which would be option B.

But earlier, when I computed dN/dr, I found it to be 5k r^4. Wait, but that's the change in N with respect to r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the change in N per unit distance) would be proportional to r^4. So that's option C.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me go back to the original problem.

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k / plx^5. Parallax plx is 1/r. So N = k r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. So for a given region, how does the number change with distance r?

If the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance, then it's N ∝ r^5. So the answer would be option B.

But the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So perhaps it's looking for the number of stars added per unit distance, which would be the derivative of N with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5k r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So that would be option C.

Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So if you move a small distance dr, how much does the number of stars change? That would be dN = (dN/dr) dr = 5k r^4 dr. So the change is proportional to r^4 times dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., per dr) increases as r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr. The number would be N_shell = (number density) × volume. But number density is k / plx^5 = k r^5. Volume is 4π r² dr. So N_shell = k r^5 ×4π r² dr =4π k r^7 dr. So the number of stars in a shell increases as r^7, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, and the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So the number of stars per unit distance would be N/(dr) = (k r^5)/dr. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of stars brighter than a certain magnitude. Because parallax is related to brightness. But I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to relate N as a function of r, so since N is proportional to r^5, then the change in N per unit r is dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the answer is option C, which is r^4.

But I'm a bit torn between options B and C. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx =1/r, that makes N = k r^5.

So the number of stars in the region is N = k r^5. So for a given region (maybe a fixed solid angle), as the distance increases, more stars are present, and the number grows as r^5. But how does this translate into the number per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the radial distribution function. The number of stars between r and r + dr would be N(r) dr, where N(r) is the number per unit distance.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a fixed volume around the Earth. Wait no, the problem says "in that region of the sky", which is a fixed area but varying distance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the units. Parallax plx has units of arcseconds. Distance r is in parsecs, so plx = 1/r. So 1/plx is r, in parsecs. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5 → r^5.

So the number of stars is proportional to r^5. So for a given region, the number increases as r^5. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, but perhaps this is the number per unit distance. So if N = k r^5, then the number per unit distance would be k r^5. So the number per unit distance is r^5. So the answer is B.

But wait, earlier when I thought about the differential, I thought the change per unit distance was r^4. But perhaps I'm mixing up the number of stars in the entire region versus the number per unit distance.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely clear on what the question is asking. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. So as you go from r to r + dr, the number of stars in that region is proportional to (r + dr)^5 - r^5. For small dr, this would approximate to 5 r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance is 5 r^4 dr / dr = 5 r^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply looking for the dependence on r, regardless of the exact derivative. Since N ∝ r^5, then the number increases as r^5 with distance. So the answer is B.

But I'm still a bit confused. Let me try to find a similar problem. Suppose the number of stars varies inversely as parallax, so N ∝ 1/plx. Since plx =1/r, then N ∝ r. So the number of stars increases linearly with distance. The change per unit distance would be dN/dr =1, a constant. So the number per unit distance is a constant.

In this case, the number of stars in a region varies as r^5, so the change per unit distance would be r^4.

Hmm, I think I'm more confident now that the correct answer is option C, which is r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \), where \(\text{plx}\) is the parallax. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance (\(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\)), we can substitute \(\text{plx}\) in terms of \(r\) to find how the number of stars depends on distance.

Substituting \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\) into \(N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5}\), we get:
\[
N \propto r^5
\]
This means the number of stars in the region increases as \(r^5\) with distance. However, the question asks specifically how the number of stars changes with distance **per unit range of distance** (\(r\)).

To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance:
\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]
Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r^3\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not cubic.
- **B) \(r^5\):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the number per unit distance.
- **C) \(r^4\):** Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \(r^4\).
- **D) \(r^2\):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not quadratic.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\). 

Answer: C
