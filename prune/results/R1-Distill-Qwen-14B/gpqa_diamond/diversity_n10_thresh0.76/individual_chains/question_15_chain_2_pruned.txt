Okay, so I have this question about planets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1's period is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star since orbital period relates to distance. Because Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So shorter period means smaller orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. Wait, if a star is more massive but same radius, it must be hotter, but that's probably not relevant here.

Transit probability depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital inclination. The formula for the probability (P) is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (a / (a * sin i)) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. I think the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2? No, wait, the geometric probability is actually (R_star / a) * (something). Or perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a)) )? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that's 1/a.

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, from our perspective, is edge-on enough that it transits. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / a), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, the geometric probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits) is given by (R_star +
