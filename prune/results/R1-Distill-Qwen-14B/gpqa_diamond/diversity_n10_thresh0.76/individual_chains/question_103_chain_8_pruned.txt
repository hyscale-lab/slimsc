Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

Hmm, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me break down the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a bromo group, and at position 5, a nitro group. Additionally, the ethan-1-one group is attached at the same position as the substituents? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone, so it's a methyl group attached to the carbonyl, right? So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a ketone group (COCH3) attached to the ring.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The nomenclature can be a bit confusing. Ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one?), no. Wait, ethan-1-one would be: the carbonyl is at position 1 of ethane, which would be O=C-CH3. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5: Br and NO2, respectively, and the ketone group (O=C-CH3) attached at the same position as one of these substituents? Or is the ketone a separate substituent?

Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one part is a ketone group. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1? Or is the ketone at another position?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let
