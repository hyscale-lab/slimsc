Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that two compounds, A and B, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when amines react with nitrous acid (which is formed from NaNO2 and HCl), they can undergo various reactions. But wait, the products here are diketones, which are compounds with two ketone groups. How do amines form ketones? Oh right, I think it's related to the Hofmann or Curtius rearrangements, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, another thing comes to mind: the Beckmann rearrangement. That's when an oxime (which is an imine with an oxygen instead of a nitrogen) rearranges upon treatment with something like aqueous acid to form a ketone. Oh, but wait, the question involves producing two ketone groups, so the starting material must have two amine groups or something that can form two oximes.

Wait, no, because the products are diketones, so maybe the starting materials are amines that can form two ketones each. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diols or something else that can be oxidized.

Wait, another approach: the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. That sounds like a diazotization reaction. Diazonium salts are usually formed from aromatic amines under these conditions, but since we're getting diketones, maybe it's aliphatic amines.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Another reaction I recall is the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides, but that doesn't fit here. Oh, maybe it's the formation of carbamates or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of carbonyl groups from amines via some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the starting materials are secondary alcohols. When secondary alcohols are treated with certain reagents, they can form ketones, but that's just oxidation. But I don't see an oxidizing agent here. Wait, the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Maybe it's a nitrosation reaction.

Wait, nitrosation of alcohols... I think that when a secondary alcohol reacts with nitrous acid (HONO), it can form an N-nitrosamine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of an oxime from a ketone.

Wait, oximes are formed when ketones react with hydroxylamine. But here, the reagents might not include hydroxylamine. Wait, but could the reaction be a kind of rearrangement after forming an oxime? Like the Beckmann rearrangement, which converts an oxime into an amide, but that doesn't form a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the products. The first product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. That's a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 2, and an isopropyl group at position
