Okay, so I've got this problem where an algorithm takes DNA sequences as input and gives numerical outputs. My task is to figure out what the output is for the sequence ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think through it carefully.

First, I need to understand how the algorithm is converting the DNA sequences into numbers. DNA sequences are made up of four nucleotides: A, T, C, G. So each position in the sequence is one of these letters. The outputs are numbers, so maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a number, and then some operation is done on them.

Let me look at the examples. The first example is AGG -> 115. The sequence has three letters. Let me break it down. A, G, G. What numbers could these represent? Well, sometimes in DNA problems, each nucleotide is assigned a numerical value. For instance, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. But wait, let's test that.

If A is 1, G is 4, then AGG would be 1,4,4. If we add them up, 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115, which is way larger. So adding them can't be it. Maybe it's a different approach.

Another idea: each nucleotide could represent a digit in a number system, like base 4. But wait, 4 digits (0-3) would be needed for base 4, but we have A, T, C, G which are 4 different letters. Hmm, maybe they're mapped to 0,1,2,3 or something. Wait, but the output numbers are 115 and 176, which are three-digit numbers. Let's see:

Take AGG. Let's say A is 0, G is 3. Then AGG would be 0,3,3. How does that translate to 115? Maybe each digit is treated as a different place. Wait, 0*100 +3*10 +3= 33, which is not 115. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is converted to a two-digit number, and then all are summed. Let's see:

If A=1, G=4, then AGG is 1,4,4. The sum would be 1+4+4=9. Not 115. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the squares or some other operation. AGG: 1^2 +4^2 +4^2=1+16+16=33. Still not 115. Hmm.

Another approach: maybe each nucleotide is mapped to a different numerical value, perhaps based on their position in the alphabet. A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. So A=1, T=20, C=3, G=7. Let's test this with AGG.

AGG: A=1, G=7, G=7. Maybe sum them: 1+7+7=15. But 115 is the output. So that's 15, which is 1*10 +5. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is treated as a digit in a higher base, but not base 4. Let's try base 10, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps each letter is converted into a two-digit number, such as A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Let's see:

For AGG, each letter would be A=10,
