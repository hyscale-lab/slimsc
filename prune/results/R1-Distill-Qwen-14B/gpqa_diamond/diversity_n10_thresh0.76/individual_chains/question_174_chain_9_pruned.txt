Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

So, first, I think I need to figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the smaller mass as m. Then the larger fragment would be 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. And this sum is 0.99M. So, 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.33M. So the two fragments are 0.33M and 0.66M. Wait, because 0.33 + 0.66 = 0.99, yes.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, since the two fragments move, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So their velocities are in opposite directions, and their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, since they have different masses, their velocities will be different. Let me think: momentum p = mv. So for the two fragments, their momenta are p1 = m1*v1 and p2 = m2*v2. Since p1 = -p2 (because they move in opposite directions and total momentum is zero), we have m1*v1 = -m2*v2. So the magnitudes are m1*v1 = m2*v2.

So, m1 =0.33M, m2=0.66M. So 0.33M *v1 = 0.66M * v2. The M cancels, so 0.33 v1 = 0.66 v2 → v1 = 2 v2.
