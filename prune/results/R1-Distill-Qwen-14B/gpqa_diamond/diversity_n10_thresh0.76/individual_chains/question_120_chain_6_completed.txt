Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, right, the parallax of a star is the apparent shift in its position relative to more distant stars, right? And the formula for distance in terms of parallax is something like distance = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. Oh wait, no, actually, I think the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. Makes sense.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are different power laws. Hmm, so I think this has to do with the distribution of stars in space.

Wait, the stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed. So that means the number density of stars is constant in all directions and at all distances. But wait, when we observe them, the number we see in a certain range of parallax depends on how the volumes at different distances stack up.

Let me think. The number of stars in a small volume should be proportional to the volume, since it's uniform. So, if I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between r and r+dr, which approximates to 4πr² dr when dr is small.

But how does this relate to parallax? Oh, right, because parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So if I have a small change in parallax dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance?

Let me calculate dr in terms of dplx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, the actual direction might not matter right now.

So the volume element in terms of parallax would be 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But I can express dr in terms of dplx. So dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that substitution would take care of it.

So substituting, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait no, wait. Let me be careful. The shell volume is 4πd² dr. So substituting d =1/plx, which gives d² = 1/plx². So the volume is 4π (1/plx²) dr.

But I have to express everything in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, taking derivative with respect to plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr is proportional to dplx/(plx²). So substituting into the volume,

Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx² ) ) 

Wait, that would make Volume proportional to (dplx) / plx^4.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * Volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So the number per unit plx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the steps again.

The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr is N = n * 4πd² dr. Since n is uniform.

But d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2.

And dr = (d dplx) / (d plx) )^{-1}.

Wait, plx = 1/d, so d plx = -1/d² dd. So, solving for dd: dd = - d² dplx. So dr = -d² dplx. Since d=1/plx, then dr = -(1/plx)^2 dplx.

So substituting into N = n *4π d² dr.

d² is 1/plx^2, dr is -(1/plx^2) dplx.

So N = n *4π * (1/plx²) * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

The negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're considering absolute numbers, we can ignore the sign. So N = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is N / dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4).

Which means the number of stars per unit plx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed in space. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely related to distance (\( \text{plx} = 1/d \)), we can express the distance \( d \) as \( d = 1/\text{plx} \).

The volume of the shell in terms of parallax becomes proportional to \( 4\pi (1/\text{plx})^2 dr \). To express \( dr \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \), we use the relation \( dr = -(1/\text{plx}^2) d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell is proportional to:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). This matches option A.
