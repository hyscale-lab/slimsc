Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The compound in question is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's being heated with excess KOH, which should probably lead to some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. The product is a light yellow solid, and its NMR and IR data are given.

First reaction step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing an elimination reaction. Since both bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, perhaps they undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so eliminating HBr from adjacent positions might form an allene or a diene. But more likely, it's forming a double bond because two adjacent bromides would lead to a di-elimination.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... So the structure must be such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. Wait, no, in the adamantane structure, the carbons are connected in a diamond lattice. So 1 and 3 positions are two carbons apart? Or adjacent? Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is a cage-like structure with four six-membered rings. The 1 and 3 positions might be on adjacent carbon atoms. So when KOH is used, it could deprotonate and eliminate HBr twice to form a diene or an allene. Alternatively, perhaps a single elimination to form a double bond? Wait, but with two bromides, maybe two eliminations occur.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think it's an alkene, maybe an allene because of the color. Allene tends to have a yellow color when pure, I think. Alternatively, maybe just a diene, but the IR and NMR data should help.

Looking at the IR spectrum, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong absorption, which could be a carbonyl (C=O) group. Wait, that's unexpected because the starting material is a dihalide. If KOH is used in a substitution, perhaps it's forming a ketone? But how? Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination followed by something else. Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a double bond, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Let's think: KOH is a strong base, but it can also act as a nucleophile. So maybe in a SN2 reaction, but with two bromides. Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so SN2 might be difficult for each bromide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ring with double bonds. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an allene. The IR peak at 1720 could be from a conjugated carbonyl though. Or perhaps I'm mistaken—the 1720 cm-1 might not be a carbonyl. Wait, that's in the range for an ester or ketone. But wait, if the product is an epoxide, the carbonyl wouldn't be present. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? No, IR of diols don't have a strong peak at 1720.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction produces a diketone. But how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane wouldn't directly form a diketone upon treatment with KOH. Unless it's a double elimination with some intermediate steps.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing the elimination of HBr twice, forming two double bonds. So, maybe an allene is formed, which would have a structure with two adjacent double bonds, like a cumulene. The IR might not show a carbonyl, but wait, the product's IR does show 1720. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I should look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, let's think about this. The peak at 4.79 is two hydrogens. Maybe they're adjacent to an electronegative group. The 2.4-2.2 region is 10H, which seems like a lot. Maybe they're in a ring, like a bridge structure, perhaps in an adamantane system. The 1.94 ppm is two hydrogens—maybe another set of protons in a different environment.

Wait, let's think about the structure
