Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes in the core, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions. The question is asking about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has a few stages. The pp-I branch is the main one, where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-3. The pp-II branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei into carbon-12, which is the main way for the Sun to produce energy. Then the pp-III branch is another part, maybe the production of boron through some reactions. But wait, I think I might be mixing up the details. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is part of the overall proton-proton chain, specifically the part where beryllium is involved, but maybe I'm not getting the exact details right.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. All other reactions remain the same. So the other branches like pp-I and pp-II continue. The pp-III is responsible for a certain part of neutrino production. Neutrinos are produced in different processes, so stopping pp-III would affect the flux of specific neutrinos.

The neutrinos we're considering are from the Sun. The question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the pp-III stopping affects these bands.

I remember that the dominant neutrinos from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain, especially the pp-I and pp-II branches. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps. Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me think. The pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, while pp-III might be a minor but higher-energy component.

Wait, another thought. The pp-III branch is part of the process that leads to the production of carbon, isn't it? So if pp-III stops, then the production of certain higher-energy neutrinos would stop. Because the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would have higher energies than those from
