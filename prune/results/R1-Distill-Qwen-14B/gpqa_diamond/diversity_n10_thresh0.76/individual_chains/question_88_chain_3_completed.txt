Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down and figure out what's going on.

So the question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they used in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some tangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is happening here.

Hmm, I remember that when you give something orally, it usually goes through the digestive system. The stomach has acid, which can break things down. But some might survive and make it to the intestines. Peyer patches are part of the immune system, right? They're in the small intestine and are a type of lymphoid tissue. So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, that's where the immune response starts.

They isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in an immune context are probably B cells, since B cells multiply when they encounter an antigen. And the sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Wait, the variable regions of immunoglobulins are crucial for recognizing antigens, and each B cell has a unique rearrangement of these genes.

Now, I'm trying to remember the processes that affect the variable heavy chains. There's VDJ recombination, which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow. That's when the genes for the variable, diversity, and joining regions are rearranged to create diversity. But once the B cell is mature and activated, there's another process called somatic hypermutation. This process introduces mutations in the variable regions, increasing the diversity and affinity of the antibodies produced.

In this scenario, the cells are already in the Peyer patches, which are part of the mucosal immune system. So the B cells there would have undergone some activation. Since the variable heavy chain genes show high variability, I'm thinking it's not the initial VDJ recombination because that's more about the initial diversity during development. Instead, during the immune response, especially after activation, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation to tweak their receptors, leading to more varied and specific responses.

Wait, but class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't directly affect the variable regions' variability. Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about the gene variability in B cells.

So the process that leads to high variability in the variable heavy chains after initial antigen exposure is likely somatic hypermutation. That's when the B cells are activated and proliferating, which fits with the scenario where they're isolated from the Peyer patches and show high variability in their variable regions.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence is observed to be affected by stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but some tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where the immune response is initiated. The proliferation of cells in the Peyer patches suggests B cell activation, and sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. 

Variable heavy chain diversity arises through two main processes: VDJ recombination, which occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow to create initial diversity, and somatic hypermutation, which introduces additional mutations in the variable regions during the immune response to increase diversity and affinity. Since the B cells are already activated and proliferating in the Peyer patches, the observed variability in the variable heavy chains is most likely due to somatic hypermutation rather than VDJ recombination. Class switching recombination and complement activation do not directly contribute to the variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains.
