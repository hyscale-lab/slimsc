Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, with some kcal and kJ values.

Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is the heat change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base to form water. But wait, this problem has multiple acids and a base, so I need to find out how much of each is reacting.

First, I should figure out the moles of each substance. Then, determine which is the limiting reactant because that will dictate how much reaction occurs.

Let's break it down. The acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2.

Calculating moles:

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4: volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M → 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole can donate 2 H+ ions. So the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should consider that here. Let me think. When H2SO4 reacts with a base, like Ba(OH)2, each mole of H2SO4 can provide two H+ ions. So yes, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol.

Next, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M → 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 can provide 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-.

So, OH- moles are 0.1 mol * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The total H+ comes from both acids, and the OH- comes from the base.

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + H2SO4's H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So, which is the limiting reactant? Because H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. OH- is less, so it will be the limiting reagent. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 mol OH- and 0.2 mol H+.

Wait, but when OH- reacts, it's neutralized by H+. Each OH- needs one H+.

So the amount of H+ consumed is 0.2 mol. So the moles of H+ remaining are 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

But wait, in terms of the neutralization process, the enthalpy is calculated based on the moles of H+ neutralized. Usually, the enthalpy of neutralization is around -5
