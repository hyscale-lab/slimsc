Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about some chemical reactions and mixtures, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y, which undergoes a disproportionation reaction. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives a single substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's compounds.

Alright, let's think about what these reactions could be. The initial mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually indicates the presence of alkenes (since they undergo addition reactions with bromine). But wait, if X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each has an alkene.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, a disproportionation happens to form Y. Disproportionation reactions are where a substance is both oxidized and reduced. A classic example is the decomposition of H2O2 into H2O and O2, but that's not relevant here. Wait, another example is the reaction of alkenes with H2 in presence of a catalyst. No, that's hydrogenation. Wait, no, the treatment here is with Pt and heated, so maybe it's a reaction where each component in X is undergoing some change.

Wait, but the result is a mixture Y that doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y has no alkenes. Because bromine water is used to test for unsaturation—like alkenes or alkynes. So if Y doesn't decolorize it, perhaps Y's components are alkanes or maybe something else without double bonds.

But wait, the initial mixture X decolorizes bromine, so X has alkenes. Then when X is treated with Pt and heated, perhaps each component in X is being hydrogenated. Because alkenes would hydrogenate into alkanes in the presence of Pt and H2. But the question doesn't mention H2 addition. Wait, the problem says that X is treated with Pt when heated. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt when heated, Y is formed. Then, Y is a mixture from a disproportionation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So, hydrogenating X and Y under severe conditions gives Z. Oh, so for X and Y, when they're hydrogenated, they both give the same product Z. So, perhaps X and Y are related in a way that when hydrogenated, they produce the same compound.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is another mixture. Upon hydrogenation, each would produce the same Z. So each component in X, when hydrogenated, would give a component in Z. Similarly for Y.

Wait, but let's think about the hydrogenation. If X has alkenes, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bonds, turning them into single bonds—so alkanes. Similarly for Y, but Y doesn't have alkenes, so maybe Y has something else that can be hydrogenated, like alkynes or maybe aromatic rings.

Wait, but the problem says that in the hydrogenation, Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate what that means. Let's say the formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100% = 14.28%. Let's see, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So (m/(12n + m)) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n. So each carbon has
