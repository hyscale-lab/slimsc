Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Trans-cinnamaldehyde specifically would have the double bond in the trans configuration between the two aromatic rings. So its structure is something like an aldehyde group (CHO) attached to a benzene ring with a propenal (CH2=CH-) group in the trans configuration, making it an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde.

The first reaction is treating this with methylmagnesium bromide, which is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. Since trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde, the Grignard should add to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but wait a second, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones, so the Grignard would definitely attack there.

So adding methyl MgBr to trans-cinnamaldehyde. The aldehyde group is at the end of a conjugated system. When the Grignard adds, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond. So the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2OMgBr after the first step, and then when quenched, it becomes CH2OH. Wait, noâ€”Grignard adds to the carbonyl, so the aldehyde (RCHO) would become RCH2OMgBr after the addition. Then, when you protonate it, you get RCH2OH. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is Ar-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Let me think, the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, I think it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO is cinnamaldehyde. But wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, I think. Or is it Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a propenal group. So the structure is benzene connected to a propenal group (CH2=CH-CHO). Oh wait, no, wait. The structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm mixing up different compounds. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with the aldehyde group attached to a double bond. So correct structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, I think it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO is cinnamaldehyde. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO. Wait, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with a double bond adjacent. So it's Ph-
