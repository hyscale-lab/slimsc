Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D, each with different expressions involving hbar.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <A> = ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector and A is the operator. Since this is a spin system, the state is a two-component vector.

First, let's clarify the state. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). I think this is a column vector, right? So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

Now, the spin operator S_y for a spin-1/2 particle is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh wait, wait. I should be precise here. The Pauli matrices are multiplied by ħ/2 when dealing with spin operators. So σ_y is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

To find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, write ψ as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. The dagger (ψ†) is the conjugate transpose, so it becomes a row vector [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, but wait, wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i? No, wait: the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is the transpose and complex conjugate. So the first component is the conjugate of 3i, which is -3i. The second component is the conjugate of 4, which is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i],
                [i, 0] ]

So when I compute ψ† S_y ψ, it's ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by ψ.

Alternatively, I can compute it as (ħ/2) times ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix.

Let me compute ψ† σ_y first. ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], and σ_y is the matrix above. So ψ† σ_y would be:

[ -3i, 4 ] * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

Wait
