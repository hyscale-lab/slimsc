Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's try to think through this.

The question says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, they mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to the single-slit diffraction scenario.

Oh right, I remember that in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles θ where a sinθ = ± mλ, with m being an integer. The first minima (the ones closest to the center) are at m = ±1. So the angular separation between these two minima would be the angle from θ=1 to θ=-1, but wait, no, because the minima are symmetric. So the angular distance between them would be 2θ, where θ is the angle for the first minimum.

Wait, no, the two first minima are on either side of the central maximum, each at θ = λ/(a) for m=1. So the angular distance between them is 2*(λ/(a)) * something. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

In single-slit, the condition is a sinθ = mλ. For the first minima, m=1. So sinθ = λ/(a). But since the angles are small, we can use the approximation sinθ ≈ θ (in radians). So θ ≈ λ/(a). But wait, that's the angle for each side. So the two first minima are each at θ = λ/(a) and θ = -λ/(a), so the angular distance between them is 2θ, which would be 2λ/(a). But wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the minima are at m=1 and m=-1, so the angular separation between the two minima is 2θ, where
