Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that Li is lithium, and the isotopes are usually denoted by the number of protons and neutrons. Wait, lithium has 3 protons normally, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is carbon-6? No wait, no, wait. Li is element number 3. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is actually carbon? No, wait, no. Wait, wait. No, Li-6 is lithium-6. Yeah, because Li normally has isotopes like Li-6 and Li-7. So the nucleus in question is a Li-6 nucleus.

So the problem is about calculating the total energy of each ion in the collider when moving at 0.96c. The options are given, so I need to compute the energy and match it to the right option.

Alright, to find the energy, I should think about relativistic mechanics. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_0 cÂ². But wait, what's m_0 here? The rest mass of the nucleus. So I need the
