Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, on two unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. The task is to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3, on the other hand, is another reducing agent, but I think it's usually used in a different context. Wait, wait, maybe BH3 is part of the formation of a borane which is then used in reductions, especially maybe in the formation of alcohols from ketones or aldehydes. Oh, right! BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, but in this case, since it's followed by H+ (probably acid workup), maybe it's a different kind of reduction. Alternatively, perhaps these are reductions of ketones to secondary alcohols, but wait, the product here is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you reduce a ketone, you'd get an alcohol. Oh, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, a tetrahydropyran with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the product is a cyclic ketone. So the starting material must have been something that can form this upon reduction.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3Â·THF (which is a common source of BH3). But the product is a ketone. If the product is a ketone, that's a carbonyl group. So perhaps the starting material was a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense because reducing a carbonyl would give an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether or something else that can form a ketone upon opening.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. No, wait. Alternatively, maybe they're cyclic esters or something else. Alternatively, wait, maybe the products are formed via a ring-opening of some sort. Let me think.

Wait, another approach. The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring (
