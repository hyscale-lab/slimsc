Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, there are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons.
2. Two signals for vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.
3. Two signals for –CH3 groups.
4. No signals for –CH2 groups.

So, the molecule has an aromatic ring with two substituents. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the NMR data might help figure this out.

Let me think about the vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond. So in an aromatic ring, that would be part of a substituent like a vinyl group (like in a styrene group) or perhaps part of an ester substituent.

Wait, but the compound has an ester group. So maybe the substituents are an ester and another group. Ester groups can be R-O-CO-O-R, but in this case, since it's attached to an aromatic ring, it would be like Ar-O-CO-R or Ar-CO-O-R.

Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. So an aromatic ester substituent would be something like Ar-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl or another aryl group.

Let's consider a possible structure. Since the NMR has vinyl protons, perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. Like an allyl ester or something.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the aromatic protons—two signals. Di-substituted aromatic rings have either two sets of protons if they're in the para position. For example, in para substitution, there are two equivalent H's in the ortho positions and two equivalent H's in the meta positions. But wait, para substitution would result in two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. Or maybe more, depending on the substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para), so the aromatic Hs would be two sets: each of two protons. So the aromatic signals would be two doublets.

But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H, each probably integrating to 2H each. So that suggests a para-disubstituted benzene.

Now, considering the substituents. One substituent is an ester. Let's think about what the other substituent could be.

The other substituent must have the vinyl protons. So perhaps it's a substituent like -CH2CH2- or something else. Wait, but vinyl groups have protons adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, the vinyl Hs in the NMR are two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.

Let me think about a vinyl group. A double bond like CH2=CH-. So the protons on the CH2 would split into a quartet, perhaps if coupled with another group. Wait, but wait, in an ester group, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester.

Wait, another possibility is that one substituent is an ester group, and the other is an ethenyl (vinyl) group. So the benzene ring has an ester (like O-CO-O-) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), but wait, that might not explain the NMR.

Alternatively, the substituent
