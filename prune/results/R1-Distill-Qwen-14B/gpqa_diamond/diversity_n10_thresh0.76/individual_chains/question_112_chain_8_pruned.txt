Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system.

Wait, but the state is proportional, which means we have to normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors. So I need to find the normalization constant.

Let me calculate the norm of the vector. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So for the first coefficient, (1+i), the absolute value squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + bi|^2 = a² + b².

The second coefficient is (2 - i), so |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the state is (1/√7)(1+i)|up> + (1/√7)(2 -i)|down>. So that's the normalized state.

Wait, but the question says the state is proportional, so we have to normalize it. So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 - i)/√7 |down>.

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2 since it's for spin up and down.

Wait, the operator matrix is 2x2 because it's the spin-1/2 system. So the operator A is:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2  0]

Because when i≠j, it's hbar/2, else zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere
