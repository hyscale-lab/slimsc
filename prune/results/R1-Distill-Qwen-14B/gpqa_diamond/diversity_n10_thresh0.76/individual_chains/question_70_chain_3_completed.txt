Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Alright, let's start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I remember that some bright red compounds are often transition metal complexes. For example, maybe copper-based? Alternatively, maybe something like sulfur or another element, but it's probably a transition metal.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. I think gas D could be something like chlorine (Cl2) or another diatomic gas. If E is hazardous, maybe it's a toxic compound. For instance, if D is Cl2, then E could be something like SOCl2 or another chlorinated compound.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids might be like H3PO4 or something else. So, when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. That makes me think of the decomposition of something like a sulfite or nitrate? Wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe C is a metal sulfide? No, upon reacting with water, sulfides typically release H2S. But in this case, two acids are formed. Alternatively, maybe C is an acid salt, like a nitrate or sulfate, but that might not form two different acids.

Wait, another angle. The decomposition of a metal sulfite (like CuSO3) with water would produce a metal hydroxide and sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is weak, but then I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe if C is a metal carbonate. No, because carbonate (CO3^2-) reacting with water would produce bicarbonate and then CO2 and OH- or something, but not sure how that would give two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate? No, because nitrates typically decompose into other compounds, but not necessarily two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide? But when sulfides react with water, they usually produce HS- and H2S, which is a gas, but that's just one acid perhaps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is an anhydride. For example, if C is COCl2 (phosgene?), but that's a gas. Hmm, maybe something else. Wait, when sulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (a strong acid) and H2SO3 (a weak acid, sulfurous acid). Oh wait, no. Actually, SO3 reacts with water to form H2SO4 only, but that's a strong acid. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts that, when hydrolyzed, produce different acids.

Wait, another possibility: C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, something like NaHCO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, and upon reacting with water it forms a strong acid and a weak acid... Wait, but metal oxides reacting with water usually form just a single acid. Unless it's something like a mixed oxide.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, but that's probably not it. Let me think again about the reactions.

So, the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). What solid A reacting with gas B in such a molar ratio?

Wait, 8 equivalents of gas B. Gas B is likely diatomic, so maybe O2, N2, Cl2, etc. Let's say B is O2. Then 8 equivalents would mean 4 molecules (since O2 is diatomic). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with D gives E. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. What solvents are formed from the reaction of two diatomic gases? For example, H2O (from H2 and O2), but that's a reaction with 2 H2 and O2, not 1:1. Alternatively, NH3 is produced from N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is HCl? No, no, H is a solvent. Oh wait, D and B combine 1:1 to make H. Solvents could be something like H2O, NH3, ClCH2Cl (but that's not from diatomic gases). Alternatively, maybe H is something like HF, but that's a weak acid, not exactly a solvent in large amounts.

Wait, another thought: if B is O2 and D is F2, then H would be OF2, but I'm not sure if that's a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is N2 and D is H2. They react in a 1:3 ratio to form NH3, which is a solvent. But the problem says a 1:1 ratio. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is Cl2 and B is another diatomic gas. If B is O2, then D is Cl2. Then, D and B in a 1:1 ratio would produce ClO something? Not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is F2. Then, 1:1 would produce 2HF, which is a weak acid, not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. Then reacting in 1:1 gives H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So H would be H2O. So D is O2, B is H2. Let me check: D (O2) reacts with B (H2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. Yes, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, but that's a 2:1 ratio. Wait, the problem says 1:1. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is F2. Then 1:1 O2 and F2 would produce 2F2O, but I'm not sure what that is. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Wait, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio. So perhaps the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another diatomic gas. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is O2. Cl2 and O2 can react to form ClO2, which is a compound but not a solvent. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Wait, the reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: D is O2 and B is another O2. So, perhaps H is O3? But O3 is not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is N2. Then, under certain conditions, they can react to form NO, but that's not a solvent either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the initial reactions again.

C reacts with D to form E. If D is Cl2, then E could be a chlorinated compound. If C is a sulfide, perhaps E is SOCl2 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, and E is NOCl or similar.

Wait, the first reaction: A + 8 equivalents of B → C. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be 4 O2 molecules. What solid A would react with 4 O2 to form a bright red product C?

Wait, maybe A is Cu. Cu reacting with O2 forms CuO, which is black, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, A could be Fe. Fe and O2 can form Fe3O4, which is black. Not red. Alternatively, maybe A is S? S is bright yellow, but when it reacts with O2, it forms SO2 or SO3, which are gases. Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product C upon reacting with water gives two acids. One strong (F) and one weak (G). So, perhaps C is a sulfite (SO3^2-) or another anion that hydrolyzes to produce two different acids. For example, if C is NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. Wait, but carbonates usually produce just one acid upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: if C is a mixed anhydride. Or perhaps C is a nitrate and another salt. Wait, maybe C is a dichloride or something.

Alternatively, perhaps C is H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). But H2O2 is a liquid, not a solid. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: what are the possible products E that are extremely hazardous. Let's think of Cl2 reacting with something. For example, SO3 reacting with Cl2 could produce SOCl2, which is toxic. But wait, if C is SO3, then reacting with Cl2 (D) would produce SOCl2, which is a toxic liquid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is SO3 and D is Cl2. Then E would be SOCl2, which is a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid (HClO?), but not sure.

Wait, the reaction of C with D gives E. If D is Cl2, perhaps E is SOCl2. What is E's structure? SOCl2 has a trigonal planar arrangement around S, so its point group might be D∞h. Wait, what's the symmetry of SOCl2? Oh, wait, SOCl2 has a structure where S is in the center, with two Cl atoms and one O atom. The structure is similar to SO2, but with a Cl instead of another O. Wait, no, SOCl2 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule, similar to NH3. So the point group would be C3v. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about E. Let's think differently. If E is SO2Cl2 (tetachlorosulfite), but that's a solid, I think. Not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and connected to two Cl atoms. So the structure is linear, which would make its point group D∞h. Because each Cl is opposite each other, but wait, no, COCl2 has two Cl atoms and one O. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, so it's a linear molecule with O=C-Cl2, but actually, no—the structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule. Wait, no. Wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a trigonal planar molecule around C? No, wait, the molecule is linear. Because COCl2 has a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is linear, with the central C, O, and two Cls arranged in a line. So the molecule is linear, so the point group would be D∞h. That's option C: D∞h.

So if E is phosgene (COCl2), then its symmetry group is D∞h.

But wait, how does that fit into the rest of the problem? Let's recap:

- A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C.

If B is O2, 8 equivalents would be 4 molecules of O2. If A is carbon, then 4 O2 would produce CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur. S (solid) reacting with O2 to form SO3, which is a solid. Wait, but SO3 is a liquid or gas under standard conditions, I think. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Let's think: when A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to make C. If B is Cl2, 8 equivalents would be 4 Cl2 molecules. Then, perhaps A is a metal that forms a chloride. For example, if A is copper metal, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would give CuCl4^2- or something else. But that might not fit the color.

Wait, but if C is SO3, which is a solid, then A could be S and B could be O2. 4 molecules of O2 (8 equivalents if considering O2 as a diatomic molecule) would combine with S to form SO3. But S + O2 → SO3? I think the reaction is more likely to produce SO2, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can form SO3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe and B is O2, forming Fe3O4, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is MnO2. But MnO2 is a dark brown solid, not bright red.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is a bright green solid, but not red. Chromium(VI) oxide is orange-red. So if C is CrO3, which is a dark red solid. Then, CrO3 would be the bright red product.

So, if A is Cr and B is O2. Reaction would be Cr + O2 → CrO3. But how many equivalents? Cr has a valency of +3, O2 is -2. To form CrO3, the reaction would be 4 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 Cr2O3. Wait, no, CrO3 is Cr(VI), so the reaction would be Cr + 3 O2 → CrO3. Cr is oxidized from 0 to +6. So for 1 mole of Cr, 3 moles O2. So for 8 equivalents, perhaps 4 moles of O2? Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 would be 4 molecules, since each O2 is 2 atoms.

Hmm, but CrO3 is a solid, bright red. Then, when CrO3 reacts with Cl2 (if D is Cl2), what happens? Well, CrO3 and Cl2 can react to form ClO2 and other products, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps another reaction: CrO3 + Cl2 → CrCl3 + O2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe CrO3 reacts with Cl2 and water to form HClO and HCl, but that's getting speculative.

Wait, but going back, C reacts with D to form E. If C is CrO3 and D is Cl2, then CrO3 + Cl2 could produce ClO2 and other products. Alternatively, maybe CrO3 reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions to form a dichloride or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with E being phosgene. Let me think again.

Another possibility: E is SO2. But SO2 is a gas, not extremely hazardous in the way phosgene is. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), but I'm not sure about its properties.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClO2, which is a toxic gas. ClO2 has a bent structure, so its point group would be C2v. Which is option D. But I'm not sure about E's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like NOCl, which is a bent molecule. NOCl has a structure similar to NO2, which is bent. So its point group would be C2v, which is option D.

But wait, let's think about the rest. C is the product of A and 8 B. If C is CrO3, then when it reacts with water, it forms Cr(OH)3 and H2CrO4 (a strong acid?) Wait, no, H2CrO4 is a strong acid. Wait, CrO3 is a strong oxidizing agent. When it reacts with water, it typically forms H2CrO4 (chromic acid) and possibly other products. But I'm not sure if it produces two different acids.

Wait, H2CrO4 is a strong acid, and maybe another acid like H2Cr2O7? Or perhaps another hydrolysis product. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is SO3, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). So when C (SO3) reacts with water, it produces H2SO4 and H2SO3. So F would be H2SO4 (strong), G would be H2SO3 (weak). That fits with the given information.

Then, what is B? If A is S and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 would mean 4 O2 molecules. So the reaction would be S + O2 → SO3. But the typical reaction is S + O2 → SO2. However, under certain conditions, perhaps with a catalyst, it can form SO3. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

But let's assume C is SO3 for now. Then, when C reacts with D (which is a gas), it forms E. If D is Cl2, then SO3 + Cl2 could form SOCl2 (phosgene) and SO2. Wait, but the reaction would require specific conditions. Alternatively, SO3 could react with Cl2 in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is SO3 + Cl2 → SO2Cl2. SO2Cl2 is chlorosulfonic acid, but I'm not sure if that's formed or what its properties are. Alternatively, perhaps it's SOCl2. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another angle: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. But the ratio is supposed to be 1:1. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is 2:1. So that might not fit.

Wait, if D is F2 and B is O2, then reacting in 1:1 ratio would give F2O? Not a common solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is F2, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is NH3 and B is H2O, but they aren't diatomic gases.

Hmm, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is O2. Then, Cl2 + O2 → 2ClO (but that's not a solvent, and the reaction doesn't typically proceed that way without a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe Cl2 and O2 under certain conditions produce ClO2, but again, not a solvent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to tie this together.

If C is SO3, then when it reacts with Cl2 (D), it forms SOCl2, which is phosgene. Phosgene is a toxic gas with the formula O=CCl2. Its structure is linear, so the point group is D∞h. Which corresponds to option C.

So E would be phosgene, with point group D∞h.

But wait, let's make sure all the pieces fit.

1. A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Assume A is S, B is O2. Then 4 O2 (since each O2 is 2 atoms, 8 equivalents mean 4 molecules of O2). So the reaction is S + 4 O2 → 2 SO3. But the typical reaction is S + O2 → SO2. Producing SO3 would require specific conditions, perhaps high pressure or catalyst, but let's go with that for this problem.

2. C (SO3) reacts with 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) to form E. So 2 SO3 + 2 Cl2 → 2 SOCl2. SOCl2 is phosgene, which is a linear molecule with point group D∞h.

3. C (SO3) reacts with water to form A (S) plus two acids F and G. SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid, F) and H2SO3 (weak acid, G). That fits.

4. D (Cl2) reacts with B (O2) in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Cl2 + O2 → 2 ClO? No, that's not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl2O7, but that's not a solvent either. Hmm, this part is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. If H is a solvent, and D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Then, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. The reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2. The problem states a 1:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is F2. Then, O2 + F2 → 2 F2O, but I don't think F2O is a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is F2 and B is O2, but again, unclear.

Wait, perhaps H isn't a common solvent like H2O or something else. Maybe H is something else. For example, if D is NH3 and B is H2O, but they aren't diatomic.

Wait, another approach: H is a solvent formed from D and B in a 1:1 ratio. The only diatomic gases that can combine in 1:1 to form a common solvent are perhaps H2O from H2 and O2. But the ratio is 2:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is O2 and B is H2, and the ratio is 2:1, but the problem says 1:1. I'm stuck here.

Perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that E is phosgene (D∞h), as all other parts fit except the D and B reaction. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about B and D.

Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is O2. Then, Cl2 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio would produce ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a reddish-brown gas, but not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another diatomic gas. Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is O2, but then H would still be ClO2, which isn't a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O (ratio 2:1). Doesn't fit 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is F2. Then, O2 + F2 → 2 F2O (dihydrogen monofluoride?), but F2O is not a solvent.

Wait, maybe B is another diatomic gas, like N2. Then, D could be H2. N2 + H2 → NH3. The ratio of N2 to H2 is 1:3, but the problem says 1:1. So perhaps that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I should accept that I can't find a perfect fit for H and focus on the other parts, since the symmetry group question is more about E.

Given that, I think E is phosgene (SOCl2), which has a D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: A + 8 equivalents of B → C (bright red)**  
   Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. A plausible candidate for C is sulfur trioxide (SO₃), which is a bright red solid. This would imply that A is sulfur (S) and B is oxygen (O₂). The reaction can be represented as:  
   \[
   S + 4 \, O_2 \rightarrow 2 \, SO_3
   \]  
   This fits the description of forming a bright red product.

2. **Reaction 2: C + 2 equivalents of D → E (extremely hazardous)**  
   When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is described as extremely hazardous. If C is SO₃ and D is chlorine gas (Cl₂), the reaction could form phosgene (SOCl₂), a highly toxic gas. The reaction can be represented as:  
   \[
   SO_3 + Cl_2 \rightarrow SOCl_2
   \]  
   Phosgene (SOCl₂) is a linear molecule with the structure O=C(Cl)₂. Its molecular symmetry group is **D∞h**, as it has a linear arrangement with twofold rotational symmetry and a plane of reflection.

3. **Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**  
   When C (SO₃) reacts with water, it produces sulfur (S), a strong acid (H₂SO₄), and a weak acid (H₂SO₃). This is consistent with the hydrolysis of SO₃:  
   \[
   SO_3 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2SO_4 \, (\text{strong acid}) + H_2SO_3 \, (\text{weak acid})
   \]  

4. **Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)**  
   Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. If D is Cl₂ and B is O₂, the reaction could form chlorine dioxide (ClO₂), but this is not a common solvent. However, this step does not significantly affect the determination of E's symmetry group.

5. **Molecular symmetry group of E**  
   Based on the analysis, E is phosgene (SOCl₂), which is a linear molecule with the structure O=C(Cl)₂. The molecular symmetry group of a linear molecule with a plane of reflection is **D∞h**.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
