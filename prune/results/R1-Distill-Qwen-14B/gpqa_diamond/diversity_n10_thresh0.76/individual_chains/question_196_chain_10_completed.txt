Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, I guess things are a bit different. Oh right, because as speeds approach the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed can be found by equating the potential energy (1/2 k A^2) to the kinetic energy (1/2 m v_max^2). Solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so option C is probably not the right answer here.

So in the relativistic case, the energy considerations change because the total energy includes relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but since this is a classical problem, I think we'll treat it as a continuous system.

Wait, the classical relativistic harmonic oscillator equation of motion is different. The force is F = -k x, but in relativity, equations can become more complex. Alternatively, perhaps we can use energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy. The total energy should also equal the potential energy at maximum displacement because at maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest momentarily (zero velocity), so all energy is potential.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at amplitude A, and kinetic is zero there. So the total energy E is (1/2) k A², right? But wait, in relativity, the energy expressions are different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy in terms of relativistic mechanics. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², so this should equal the total energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, but wait: in the classical relativistic oscillator, is the potential energy still (1/2)k x²? I think so because the restoring force is F = -k x. So the potential energy is the integral of F dx, which would be (1/2)k x².

So, at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero because velocity is zero there. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A².

But wait, that's not correct because the total energy of the system in relativity would include the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the relativistic expression for energy. The total energy is gamma m c², which is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. So E = (1/2) k A².

But wait, that can't be right because when you're moving, you have gamma m c² as total energy. So in the system, the total energy (potential plus kinetic) is the same as the relativistic energy. So maybe when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2) k A², which equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. No, wait, that's not correct because rest energy is mc², and when the oscillator is at rest, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², which must equal the total energy. Wait, that can't be right because E = mc² is the rest energy, but here the oscillator is moving, so perhaps the potential energy isn't the only term.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the systems. Let's think differently. The total energy of the oscillator in motion should be the same as the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Because at maximum displacement, all the kinetic energy is zero and potential is maximum. So E = (1/2)k A² = gamma m c² when the system is moving at maximum speed.

Wait, no, that's not right because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's momentarily at rest, so its velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy is potential. So the total energy E is just (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the total energy is also gamma m c². But at the point of maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = mc². Hmm, that's a problem because (1/2)k A² would have to equal mc², which is probably not the case. So perhaps that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is minimal, and the kinetic energy is maximum. That is, when x=0, the velocity is maximum. So in that case, all energy is kinetic. But in the classical case, that's when E = (1/2) k A² = (1/2) m v_max^2. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be E = (gamma - 1) m c², and the potential energy is (1/2) k x².

Wait, but when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is (gamma - 1) m c², but E is also (1/2)k A² from the potential when x=A. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the system's energy. The total energy E is (1/2)k A², as that's the maximum potential energy when x=A. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So we have E = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So let's set that up:

(gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), and here v is the maximum speed v_max.

So:

gamma = 1 + (1/(2 m c²)) k A².

Wait, no. Let me write the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Hmm, but that can't be right because the units don't match. The term (k A²) has units of energy (since k is N/m and A^2 is m², so N·m). And m c² is energy as well, so the units are okay.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Then, gamma = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm. Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable to make it easier. Let's call it 'a' for now.

So 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So 1/(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + 2a + a².

Wait, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which could be small if k A² is much smaller than m c². But if k A² is comparable to m c², then a is not negligible.

But let's proceed. Let's rearrange the equation:

1/(1 - v²/c^2) = 1 + 2a + a².

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps solving for v in terms of gamma.

Let me try to invert it. Let me write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

We can write gamma = (something). So,

gamma = [ (k A²) + 2 m c² ] / (2 m c² ) ? Wait, no, because it's 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that would be:

gamma = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

But that's the same as 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the equation I had earlier was:

(gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Yes, that's correct.

Now, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), let's square both sides:

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c^2).

So,

gamma^2 = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

We can invert both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ].

Hmm. Let me compute [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] as a single term. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as b, so b = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2.

Which is equal to [ (1 + b)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2b + b² -1 ) = 2b + b².

So,

v²/c² = (2b + b²) / (1 + b)^2.

But b is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so plugging back in:

v_max² = c² * [ (2b + b²) ) / (1 + b)^2 ].

Hmm, but perhaps we can simplify this expression. Let's factor numerator and denominator.

Let me write b as x, for easier writing. So,

v²/c² = (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2.

Factor numerator: x(2 + x).

Denominator: (1 + x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [x(2 + x)] / (1 + x)^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can express this differently. Alternatively, perhaps to expand gamma and solve for v.

Wait, another approach: let's write (gamma -1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But since gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2),

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)].

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(2 m c^2)^2 ) - 1.

Simplifies to:

2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m² c^4).

Which becomes:

(k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

This looks complicated, but perhaps it can be factored or simplified.

Wait, perhaps let me factor the numerator:

(k A^2)/(m c^2) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ].

Because,

(k A^2)/(m c^2) [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] = (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m^2 c^4).

But wait, the numerator I have is (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4), which is different. So that approach may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be written as [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ]^2.

So,

denominator = [ (2 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Hmm, perhaps let me compute the entire expression for v_max.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to see which option matches this expression.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))^2) )

Wait, that doesn't look like it. Let me check all the options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) )).

Hmm, not sure.

Option C: sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, so probably not the right answer.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 ).

Wait, let's compute v_max from our expression.

We have v² = c² [ (2b + b²)/(1 + b)^2 ], where b = kA²/(2 m c²).

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2 ].

Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when setting up the energy equation.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2 when x=A, and at that point, the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)k A^2 = gamma m c^2 when the oscillator is at maximum velocity? No, wait, when x=A, the speed is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = mc² = (1/2)k A^2. But that can't be correct because (1/2)k A^2 would then be much larger than mc² for typical oscillator parameters, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the oscillator's potential and kinetic energies. But that's confusing because in relativity, the total energy is mc² plus the kinetic part.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy in the oscillator is (1/2)k x², and the total energy E is (1/2)k A², which is the maximum potential energy. At any other point, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is the rest energy plus the relativistic kinetic energy. Wait, but that's not making sense to me.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic version of the harmonic oscillator equation. I recall that in relativistic mechanics, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is different. The force is F = -k x, but in relativity, the equation becomes more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the equation is (d/dt)(gamma m v) = -k x. But that's the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator.

So, the equation is d/dt (gamma m v) + k x = 0.

But solving this differential equation seems complicated, and perhaps for maximum speed, we can consider energy approaches.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the options given and see which one makes sense dimensionally and conceptually.

Option C is the non-relativistic maximum speed, so it's probably not the right answer. So we can eliminate option C.

Looking at the other options, I need to see which one reduces to option C when c is very large (non-relativistic limit).

Let me check each option in the limit c → ∞.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2m))^2) )

Wait, in non-relativistic limit, c is very large. So the term k A²/(2m) is likely small, as for a normal oscillator, k A²/(2m) is the square of the non-relativistic max speed squared over c squared. So when c is large, (k A²/(2m)) is small, so denominator becomes 1 - ε where ε is small. So 1/(1 - ε) ≈ 1 + ε.

So inside the sqrt:

1 + 1/(1 - ε) ≈ 1 + (1 + ε) ) = 2 + ε.

So sqrt(2 + ε) * c. But in non-rel limit, v_max should be sqrt(k A²/m).

Hmm, not matching.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c²)) )).

Again, in non-rel limit, k A²/(2 m c²) is very small, so denominator is about 1. So 1/(1 - something small) is about 1 + something small.

So inside the sqrt: 1 + (1 + something) ≈ 2 + something.

So v_max ≈ c sqrt(2) → which is much higher than the non-rel speed. So this can't be right.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ).

Again, in non-rel limit, k A²/(2 m c²) is negligible, so denominator approaches 1. So 1/(1 + ... ) ≈ 1.

So inside sqrt: 1 - 1/(1)^2 = 1 -1 = 0. So v_max approaches zero, which is not correct.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let me compute for option D in non-rel limit.

If c → ∞, then k A²/(2 m c²) → 0.

So 1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) ≈ 1.

So 1/(1 + ... )^2 ≈ 1.

So the term inside the sqrt is 1 - 1 = 0. So v_max approaches zero, which can't be correct. So option D is not the right answer.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m) ), which is option C.

In the relativistic case, the maximum speed would be less than c, and as the relativistic effects become stronger (i.e., when k A^2 is comparable to m c^2), the maximum speed approaches c.

Wait, but in the options, only options A and B have v_max approaching c as k A^2 increases.

Looking at option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m))^2 )) → as kA²/(2m) approaches 1, the denominator approaches zero, and the term inside the sqrt becomes very large, so v_max approaches infinity, which is impossible because it can't exceed c. So option A can't be correct.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c²)) )) → again, as kA²/(2 m c^2) approaches 1, the denominator approaches zero, so the term becomes large, and v_max approaches c times infinity, which is impossible. So option B is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the energy approach.

The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At the point of maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero and potential energy is (1/2)k A^2. So E = mc^2 + 0 = (1/2)k A^2.

Wait, that can't be correct because (1/2)k A^2 = mc^2 would require k A² = 2 m c^2. That's a very high k and A, which is unlikely.

So perhaps my energy approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is E = (1/2)k A^2, and at the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, and the kinetic energy is E = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

So,

(gamma - 1) m c^2 = (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which gives,

gamma = [ (2 m c^2) + k A² ] / (2 m c^2).

Thus,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

And since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as b. So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + b.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v^2/c^2) = (1 + b)^2.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + b)^2.

Then,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + b)^2].

= [ (1 + b)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + b)^2.

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2b + b^2 -1 ) = 2b + b^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2b + b²)/(1 + b)^2.

But b is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so substituting back,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))]^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression. Let me factor the numerator:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

So numerator becomes (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k A^2)^2/(4 m^2 c^4).

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ]^2.

Wait, maybe we can write the numerator as (k A^2/(m c^2)) * [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Because,

(k A^2/(m c^2)) * [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] = (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m^2 c^4).

But our numerator is (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ), which is not the same. So that approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the entire expression as:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2.

Hmm, that would give:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/(m c^2) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ).

Which simplifies to:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2 )/(m c^2) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Wait, denominator was (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c^2)) ] * [ 2 m c^2/(2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ].

Multiplying terms:

= c^2 * (k A^2) * 2 m c^2 / [ m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

Simplify:

= c^2 * (2 m c^2 k A^2 ) / [ m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ]

Wait, the m c^2 terms cancel:

= c^2 * (2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can factor numerator and denominator.

Divide numerator and denominator by m c^2:

= [ 2 k A^2 c^2 / (m c^2) ] / [ 2 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) ]

But 2 k A^2/(m c^2) = 2 (k A^2/(m c^2)).

Wait, let me factor this:

v_max^2 = [ 2 (k A^2/(m c^2)) * c^4 ] / [ 2 + (k A^2/(m c^2)) ) ]

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as:

v_max^2 = [ 2 (k A^2) c^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Hmm. Let me factor denominator as m c² (2 + (k A²)/(m c²)).

So,

v_max^2 = [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ m c^2 (2 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) ) ]

= [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ m c^2 (2 + b) ), where b = (k A^2)/(m c^2).

Simplify:

= [ 2 k A^2 ] / [ m (2 + b) ) ]

But 2 k A^2 = 2 m c^2 (b/(2)) ).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of the initial variables.

But looking at the options again, perhaps none of them match this expression. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the energy equation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the total energy is (1/2)k A^2. In reality, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)k A^2 plus the rest mass energy.

Wait, that would make more sense. So, E = (1/2)k A^2 + mc².

So when x=A, the velocity is zero, so E is the sum of potential and rest mass energy.

At x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So,

(gamma - 1) m c^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is the same as earlier. So I think my earlier approach was correct.

Wait, but then from gamma, I derived that v_max^2 = [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ].

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate this to match one of the options. Let's try.

Let me write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ 2 k A^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] )

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I should manipulate the options to see which one could reduce to this expression.

Looking at option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 )) * c.

Hmm, let's compute the term inside the square root:

1 + 1/[ (1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) ]

= [ (1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) + 1 ] / (1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 )

= [ 2 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ] / denominator.

Hmm, not matching.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2 m c^2)) )) * c.

Let me compute the term inside the sqrt:

1 + 1/(1 - x), where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

= [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x )

= (2 - x)/(1 - x )

So, sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 - x) ) *c.

Hmm, not matching our expression.

Option D: sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ) *c.

= sqrt( [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ) ) *c.

Wait, the numerator inside the sqrt is [ (1 + b)^2 -1 ] where b = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is [1 + 2b + b^2 -1 ] = 2b + b^2.

So,

sqrt( (2b + b^2)/(1 + b)^2 ) *c.

Which is sqrt( [b(2 +b)]/(1 +b)^2 ) * c.

= [ sqrt(b (2 +b)) / (1 +b) ) ] * c.

But b is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) * c.

= [ sqrt( (k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (2 m c^2)^2 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ] * c.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

(k A^2) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 )^2.

Which is [k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (4 m² c^4).

So the square root becomes sqrt( [k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 ).

So,

sqrt( k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) = A sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ).

So, putting it all together:

v_max = [ A sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) / (2 m c^2) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ] * c.

Wait, the denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let's write it:

v_max = [ sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) * A / (2 m c^2) ) ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ] * c.

Simplifying,

= [ sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) * A * 2 m c^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2) * (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ] * c.

Cancel 2 m c^2 terms:

= [ sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) * A ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) * c.

Hmm, and sqrt( k (2 m c^2 + k A^2) ) is sqrt( k (denominator) ), so we can write:

= [ sqrt(k) * sqrt( denominator ) * A ] / denominator ) * c.

= [ sqrt(k) * sqrt( denominator ) * A ] / denominator ) * c.

The sqrt(denominator) over denominator is 1/sqrt(denominator).

So,

= [ sqrt(k) * A ] / sqrt( denominator ) ) * c.

Denominator is 2 m c^2 + k A^2.

So,

v_max = [ sqrt( k ) * A * c ] / sqrt( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ).

Hmm, but this doesn't match the expression I derived earlier, which was [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ]/[ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ].

So perhaps option D isn't giving the same result as my derivation.

Wait, let me check if any of the options match the expression I have for v_max^2:

v_max^2 = [2k A^2 c^2 ] / [2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

Let me see which option, when squared, gives this.

Option D's expression inside the square root is (2b + b²)/(1 + b)^2, which is what I had earlier. So, when I compute v_max from option D, I get:

v_max = c * sqrt( (2b + b^2)/(1 + b)^2 ), where b=(k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2b + b^2)/(1 +b)^2.

Substituting b,

= c^2 * [ 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2)) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))^2 ] / [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))]^2.

Which is,

= c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c^2)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) )^2 ].

Simplify denominator:

[ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) / (4 m² c^4) ) ].

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c^2) ) (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ] * [4 m^2 c^4)/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

= c^2 * [k A^2/(m c^2) ) ( ... ) ] * [4 m^2 c^4 / ( ... )^2 ].

Let me compute this step by step.

Numerator of the big fraction:
(k A^2/(m c^2)) * (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) = (k A^2/(m c^2)) + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m^2 c^4).

Denominator:
[ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2/(m c^2)) (1 + ...) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m^2 c^4) ) ]

= c^2 * (k A^2/(m c^2) ) * (1 + ...) ) * (4 m^2 c^4 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Multiply terms:

= c^2 * (k A^2) * 4 m^2 c^4 / ( m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ) * (1 + ...) )

Wait, simplifying,

= c^2 * 4 m^2 c^4 k A^2 / ( m c^2 (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ) ) * [ (1 + ...) ]

But (1 + ...) is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] = (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2).

So,

= c^2 * 4 m^2 c^4 k A^2 * (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) / [ m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= c^2 * 4 m^2 c^4 k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / [ 2 m c^2 * m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

= c^2 * 4 m^2 c^4 k A^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) / [ 2 m^2 c^4 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

Cancel terms:

4 m^2 c^4 / 2 m^2 c^4 = 2.

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) in numerator and denominator cancel one term.

So,

= c^2 * 2 k A^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

Which is exactly the same as the expression I derived earlier for v_max^2.

So, v_max^2 = [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ]

Which matches the expression from option D.

Wait, option D says v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Which, when squared, gives v_max^2 = c^2 ( 1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ), where b = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which, as we saw earlier, simplifies to [ 2 k A^2 c^2 ] / [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ].

So yes, option D's expression gives the same result as our derivation.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Setup**:  
   The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is kinetic. Thus:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   From the above equation:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Simplifying for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with the relativistic energy considerations and matches Option D.
