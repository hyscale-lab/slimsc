Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what they're asking. The problem involves an electron state and some operator measurements.

Hmm, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I think |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form a basis. But the state isn't yet normalized, right? So first, I probably need to normalize this state.

Let me write down the state. So |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then divide by the square root of that. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i), because when you take the inner product, you multiply each component by its complex conjugate.

Calculating each term: (1+i)(1-i) is 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Wait, no wait, that's (1+i)(1-i) = 1*1 + 1*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². The i terms cancel, so 1 +1 = 2. Oh right, because (a+b)(a-b) is a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) is 1² - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Next term: (2-i)(2+i) is 2² - (i)^2 =4 - (-1)=5. So adding both terms: 2 +5 =7. So the inner product is 7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> becomes (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the question is about the operator whose matrix representation is A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so in a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2 each. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the indices. Because for a two-level system, the basis states are |up> and |down>, which would correspond to basis vectors |1> and |2>, perhaps. So A_12 = ħ/2 and A_21 = ħ/2. The diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero.

Wait, what kind of operator is this? Oh, this looks like the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply each element by ħ/2, you get this matrix. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

But wait, the Pauli matrices are usually represented with σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so our operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A, and also the average value of A.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, since it's just a scalar multiple. So the eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x. So let me think about that.

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1. So the operator A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the system in each eigenstate of operator A. So I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize operator A and express |alpha> in that basis, then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2)σ_x, and σ_x has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, respectively. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the operator can be written in terms of these.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the expectation value and the probabilities. Let me proceed.

First, to find the probabilities, we can express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Since A is proportional to σ_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2

So any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these.

Our |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>. Let me write this as a vector. Let me write |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1). So the state vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, to find the expansion in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

The inner product of |alpha> with |+x> is:
⟨+x| alpha ⟩ = [1/√2, 1/√2] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T
= [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )
Simplify numerator: (1+2) + (i -i) = 3. So 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is:
⟨-x| alpha ⟩ = [1/√2, -1/√2] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (-1) + 2i ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, but wait: Let me compute that again.

⟨-x| alpha ⟩ = (1/√2)(1+i)/√7 + (-1/√2)(2 -i)/√7
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))
= [1 +i -2 +i ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Wait, but the square of the absolute value of each will give the probabilities.

So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 (the eigenvalue of |+x>) is |⟨+x| alpha ⟩ |^2.

So |3/(sqrt(14))|^2 = 9/14.

Similarly, the probability for |-x> is | (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14) |^2.

Calculating that, the numerator is (-1 +2i), so the absolute square is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6429 and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571. So approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7 for the average. But I'm to calculate the average of operator A as well.

So the average value <A> is given by ⟨alpha| A |alpha⟩.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩.

But σ_x is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ is the inner product of (a*, b*) with σ_x (a, b), which is a* b + b* a.

Wait, let me compute that. The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

So σ_x |alpha> is [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ].

Then ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ is (1+i)* (2-i) /7 + (2-i)* (1+i)/7.

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i)(2 -i) = 2(1) +1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i)
= 2 -i +2i -i²
= 2 + i - (-1) [since i² is -1]
= 2 +i +1 =3 +i.

Second term: (2-i)(1+i) = 2(1) +2(i) -i(1) -i(i)
= 2 +2i -i -i²
= 2 +i - (-1)
= 3 +i.

So each term is (3 +i)/7.

Adding both terms: (3+i +3+i)/7 = (6 + 2i)/7.

Wait, but wait: ⟨alpha| σ_x |alpha⟩ is the sum of (1+i)(2-i)/7 + (2-i)(1+i)/7.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute each part again.

Wait, the inner product (a*, b*) multiplied by σ_x (a, b) is:

a* * b + b* * a.

So,

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7)

b = (2-i)/sqrt(7), so b* = (2+i)/sqrt(7)

So a* b = (1-i)(2-i)/7.

(1-i)(2-i) = 2(1) + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 → 2 -i -2i + (-1) → 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i +i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i²=-1]
= 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2+i)(1+i)/7.

Compute (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i *1 +i *i
= 2 + 2i +i +i²
= 2 +3i + (-1)
= 1 +3i.

So b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

Adding a* b and b* a: (1-3i +1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So ⟨sigma_x⟩ is 2/7.

So the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that's neat. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. So A looks correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the probabilities.

The probability for |+x> is 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, which is approximately 0.64, and the other is 5/14 ≈0.3571, which is about 0.36. So option A's probabilities match.

So the average is ħ/7, which is option A.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩ given as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is \( |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \). To normalize, compute the inner product:
\[
⟨α|α⟩ = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Identify the operator \( A \)
The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the eigenbasis of \( A \)
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \), compute the inner products:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α| A |α \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle α| \sigma_x |α \rangle.
\]
Using the state |α⟩, compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2-i)(1+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
