Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a 1,4-conjugate addition. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and I need to determine the correct products from the given options.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt in EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, I think. It's an enolate donor. The other component is a methyl acrylate, which has an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. So the Michael addition would occur here.

In a Michael reaction, the enolate attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group, which is at the alpha position.

When the enolate attacks, the attack should be at the beta carbon. Let me sketch this mentally. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the alpha carbon. Wait, actually, the structure is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents on carbons 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CH-CO-p-tolyl? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, actually, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is CH2=CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the gamma position? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, but in this case, the substituent is on the beta carbon. So it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So maybe it's actually CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the alpha position. Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. So, the molecule is CH
