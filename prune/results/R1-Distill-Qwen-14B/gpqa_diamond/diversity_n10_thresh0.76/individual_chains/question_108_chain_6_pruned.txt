Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Alright, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic properties due to electrons, probably related to the Zeeman effect or something like that.

The problem states that the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. So, m is small, which probably means it's close to zero. Wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for the 2p orbital, or maybe higher for higher orbitals. But the problem says small, so maybe m is 0? Or perhaps the values are small compared to something else.

The question is asking about the order of magnitude between the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (I think, because it's written ⟨H⟩) and the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, I think. The 0.4861 micrometer wavelength corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen, right? Or wait, no, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. Let me think: The Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm (which is 0.656 micrometers), so maybe this 0.4861 is the Balmer-beta line or something else. Alternatively, it could be the Lyman series. Wait, the Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm (0.121 micrometers). So 0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range. Oh, wait, the Balmer series is when electrons transition to n=2. So from n=3 to n=2 gives H-beta at about 486 nm (0.486 micrometers). Yes, that's it.

So the transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me remember the constants: h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that. Let's calculate the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ approximately 4.088e-19 J. Hmm, that's the energy in joules. To convert to electron volts, since 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J, so 4.088e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ about 2.55 eV. Wait, but wait, the hydrogen transition from n=2 to n=1 (Balmer-alpha) is about 1.89 eV, but this is H-beta, which is n=3 to n=2, which has a higher energy. Alternatively, maybe I should verify the exact calculation.

Wait, maybe I should redo the calculation more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute hc: 6.62607015e-34 J·s * 299792458 m/s ≈ 1.98645e-25 J·m.

λ = 0.4861e-6 m.

So hc/λ = 1.98645e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = let's see, 1.98645e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.084e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.084e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, but I think the actual ionization energy of hydrogen is about 13.6 eV, so the transition from n=2 to n=1 (which is the Balmer-alpha line) is 13.6 - 3.4 = 10.2 eV, but that doesn't match. Wait, no, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. n=3, E3 = -13.6/9 ≈ -1.51 eV. So the transition from n=3 to n=2 would be E2 - E3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) )= -1.89 eV. The magnitude is 1.89 eV. But wait, that's the energy emitted, so the photon energy would be 1.89 eV. But according to my earlier calculation, I got 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated hc/λ. Let me compute it again.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 0.4861 μm = 4.861e-7 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divided by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = 4.088e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.088e-19 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 2.55 eV.

But according to the energy levels, the transition from n=3 to n=2 should be about 1.89 eV. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the wavelength given isn't for the n=3→n=2 transition. Let me check: The Balmer-beta line is indeed about 486 nm (0.486 μm), which corresponds to the transition from n=4 to n=2. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think: The Balmer series is when electrons transition to the n=2 level. So the possible transitions are from n=3→2, n=4→2, n=5→2, etc.

The wavelengths are given by 1/λ = R*(
