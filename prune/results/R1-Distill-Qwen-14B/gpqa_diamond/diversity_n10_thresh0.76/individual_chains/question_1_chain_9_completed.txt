Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?

Hmm, the options are A to D, with energies in eV. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ (hbar), which is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

Wait, but time here is given as the lifetime of the states. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, is the lifetime of each state. Oh wait, but wait—both states have different lifetimes. Or is the question considering the time resolution required to distinguish them?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So if the states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, then their energy uncertainties would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. But wait, the problem is about resolving two energy levels, so perhaps we need the energy difference between them to be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe just each of their uncertainties?

Wait, no, when you have two states with different energies, to resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of both states. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might overlap and not be distinguishable.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps, since each state has its own uncertainty, the difference must be bigger than each individual uncertainty? Not sure.

Wait, let me think. When you have two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the uncertainty in their energies is ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2. To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the sum, then the peaks might overlap and you can't clearly tell them apart.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2? Or is it the maximum of the two? Wait, perhaps it's more precise to say that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because each state's lifetime determines its uncertainty. So the energy difference needs to be larger than each individual uncertainty.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the two states each have their own energy uncertainties. The resolution of the two levels would require that their energy separation is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, to avoid them overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So to resolve them, the energy difference (E2 - E1) must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the separation is smaller than that sum, the two peaks in the energy spectrum might overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to think of it another way. The energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * τ ≈ ħ. So for a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/τ.

If you have two states, say state A with τ1 and state B with τ2, then their energy uncertainties are ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ/τ2.

To resolve them, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is less than the sum, then the two energy levels' uncertainties might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

So ΔE = E2 - E1 should satisfy ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) = (ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2). Because if it's bigger, they are clearly separated.

Let me compute that sum.

Given:
τ1 = 1e-9 seconds
τ2 = 1e-8 seconds

So ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-9) = 1.05e-25 J
ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.05e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05e-26 J

So sum is 1.05e-25 + 1.05e-26 = 1.155e-25 J.

But we need ΔE in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So converting 1.155e-25 J to eV:

1.155e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.2e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV to be resolvable.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 n eV → 1e-9 eV is way smaller than 7.2e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. So no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is bigger than 7.2e-7, so that's possible.

D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, which is 0.1e-7. 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6, which is larger than 0.1e-7. So no, 1e-8 is smaller than 7.2e-7.

Wait, but wait. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 100 microelectronvolts. The required ΔE is about 0.72e-6 eV, which is 0.72 microeV. So 1e-4 is much larger, so yes, it's resolvable.

But let me think again. Are there other considerations? Because the problem is about the energy difference needed to clearly distinguish the two levels. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the energy resolution. The energy resolution would be determined by the uncertainty in the energy, which is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Wait, maybe I should consider the energy uncertainty due to the lifetimes. So each state's energy has an uncertainty, and the instrument's capability to resolve two states would require that the energy difference is greater than the combined uncertainty.

Wait, but the instrument's time resolution is probably tied to the uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Hmm, but in the problem, the two states have different lifetimes. So their uncertainties are different. So the combined uncertainty would be adding the two, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the individual uncertainties. For example, if the energy difference is larger than each state's uncertainty, they can be resolved. Because each state's energy is spread by their own uncertainty, so the difference must be more than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me think: E1 is uncertain by ΔE1, E2 is uncertain by ΔE2. The energy difference (E2 - E1) must be more than ΔE1 + ΔE2 to make sure that even considering their uncertainties, they don't overlap.

Wait, but when two peaks are each spread by their own uncertainties, the minimum separation to avoid overlap is when the separation is greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So that's correct.

So the energy difference must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Earlier, I calculated that sum to be about 7.2e-7 eV. So any energy difference larger than this would be resolvable.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-8, so 1e-4 is definitely larger than 7.2e-7.

So option C would be resolvable.

Wait, but why is option D 1e-8 eV? That's much smaller than 7.2e-7 eV. So that's insufficient, right?

So the correct answer must be option C.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the sum of uncertainties is (1e-9 + 1e-8) seconds? No, no, the sum is the sum of the energy uncertainties.

Wait, the lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So τ1 is 1e-9, tau2 is 1e-8.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ/(tau1) = (1.05e-34 J s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(tau2) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J → 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = 6.56e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.56e-7 + 6.56e-8 = 7.216e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 eV → smaller than 7.2e-7 → no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller → no.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → 1e-4 is 1e4 times 1e-8 → definitely larger than 7.2e-7.

D) 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → smaller than 7.2e-7.

So the only option that meets the requirement is option C.

Wait, but wait again. The question says "their energy difference", so E = ΔE. So for the two states to be resolved, their ΔE must be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 7.2e-7. So that would work.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the time uncertainty (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar \), the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for each state are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

To convert these values to electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total energy uncertainty for resolving the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
