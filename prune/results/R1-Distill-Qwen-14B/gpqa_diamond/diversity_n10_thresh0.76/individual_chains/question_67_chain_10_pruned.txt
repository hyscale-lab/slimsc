Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, it's about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2. Both are 1, which makes sense for a p orbital because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum, the eigenvalues are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, the possible Lz values are -ħ, 0, +ħ since l=1. 

But in this state, the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, what does this mean for the individual electrons' states? 

I think when you have a coupled state |l1, l2, L, M>, the individual states are expressed as a combination of product states. The coupled state is a linear combination of the product states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, where m1 + m2 = M. 

In our case, M is -1. So each possible pair of m1 and m2 that adds up to -1 contributes to this state. 

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)
Because -1 can be broken down as (-1 + 0) and (0 + -1). 

Wait, but wait a minute, for l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, the maximum L is 2 (since 1+1=2) and the minimum is 0 (since |1-1|=0). So in this case, L is 2. So the state is a combination of m1 and m2 where their sum is -1. 

Now, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific state in the coupled basis. But to find the probability of getting specific m1 and m2 values, I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of m1 and m2. 

I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (CG coefficients) are used to express the coupled states as linear combinations of product states. 

The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a sum over m1 and m2 of CG coefficients multiplied by |m1> |m2>, where m1 + m2 = M. 

So for |1,1,2,-1>, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are the ones that add up to -1. So m1 can be m, and
