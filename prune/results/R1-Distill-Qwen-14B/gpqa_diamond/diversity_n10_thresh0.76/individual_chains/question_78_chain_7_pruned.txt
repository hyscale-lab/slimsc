Alright, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Okay, let's break it down.

First, the question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're considering the electromagnetic potentials at a point r at time t, where t is greater than tr. Tr is the time when the field was generated, so the charge was at a different position then.

I remember that in electromagnetism, the potentials are usually solutions to Maxwell's equations. But when charges are moving, especially at relativistic speeds, we have to consider how potentials depend on velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. I think that for a static charge, V would be the usual Coulomb potential, which is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things change because of the motion's effects.

Wait, but in this case, the charge is moving, so the potentials at a later time would depend on the charge's velocity at the earlier time tr. So the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge.

I recall that the vector potential A is typically given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) times something involving velocity. Oh right! For a moving charge, the vector potential can be expressed as A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) times some factor.

Wait, but how exactly? I think the general form involves the velocity of the charge and the
