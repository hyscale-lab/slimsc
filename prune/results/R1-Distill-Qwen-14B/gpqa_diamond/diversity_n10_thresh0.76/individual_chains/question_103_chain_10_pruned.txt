Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. 

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a phenyl group with substituents at positions 3 and 5â€”3-bromo and 5-nitro. And attached to that phenyl group is a ketone (ethan-1-one), which is an acetyl group (CH3CO-).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the structure would be benzene with substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1. Wait, no, wait: the substituents are on the benzene ring, and the ketone is attached to the benzene as a side chain. So the benzene is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), with a methyl group attached. So the ketone is at the position where the benzene is attached to a carbonyl and a methyl.

Wait, but the way it's named is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, and the phenyl group is attached to the first carbon of the ethanone. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 3 and nitro at 5, connected via a C(O)CH3 group.

Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, so the structure is the benzene ring connected to a ketone group (CO-) with a methyl group. So, the benzene is attached to the carbonyl carbon, which has a methyl group as well. So it's a acetophenone derivative.

So the target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So the substit
