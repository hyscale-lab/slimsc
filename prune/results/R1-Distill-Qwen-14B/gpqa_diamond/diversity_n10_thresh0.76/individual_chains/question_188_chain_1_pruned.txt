Okay, so today I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but the angles can be different. Wait, no, wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are of equal length, but the angles between the edges can vary. Oh right, but in some cases, like a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, but in a rhombohedral, they're not.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms here. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So all the angles in the crystal are 30 degrees each. That's a pretty skewed structure.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember the formula for calculating interplanar distances in crystals. The formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(kl cos alpha) + 2(lh cos beta) ) )... wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's for a more general case, maybe for a hexagonal system or something. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, since all angles are the same, maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, no, the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) - 2 hk cos(theta)/ (a b) - 2 kl cos(phi)/(b c) - 2 lh cos(psi)/(a c) )). But wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case where a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma, the formula might be easier. Since all the edges are equal and all angles are the same, perhaps.

Wait, another approach. The interplanar distance for a crystal plane (hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) +
