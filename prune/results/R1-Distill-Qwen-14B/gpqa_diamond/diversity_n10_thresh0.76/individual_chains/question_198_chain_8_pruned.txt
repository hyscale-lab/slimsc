Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. So the higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex, right? Like, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- maybe? I think the number of SCN- increases with each β.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions attached, I think. So that's probably the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which has β2=40.

But to find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to all possible complexes. So the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN-.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the log of the stability constant and the concentrations. The formula for the fraction f_n is (β_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of β_m * [Co] * [SCN]^m ). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the general approach is to calculate the formation of each complex step by step. The fraction of each complex depends on the product of the stability constant and the ratio of the ligand concentration.

Wait, the formula for the fraction f_n is (β_n [L]^n) / sum_{m} (β_m [L]^m ). Because [Co] is the same for all complexes, it cancels out when calculating the fractions, right?

Wait, let me clarify. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the complex species. So [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But I think each complex is formed by the stepwise addition of ligands. So the fraction of each complex is [CoL_n] = β_n [Co] [L]^n / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [L]^4 ). Or wait, maybe it's more about the cumulative product of the β's up to that step.

Wait, no. The correct way is to calculate the fraction for each complex as (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the sum over all m of (β_m [SCN]^m). Because the [Co] is a common factor, it cancels out when considering the fractions.

Wait, let me model this. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species:

c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But each [Co(SCN)_n]^charge is equal to β_n [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n.

Therefore, the total Co concentration is [Co^2+] multiplied by (1 + sum_{n=1 to 4} β_n [SCN]^
