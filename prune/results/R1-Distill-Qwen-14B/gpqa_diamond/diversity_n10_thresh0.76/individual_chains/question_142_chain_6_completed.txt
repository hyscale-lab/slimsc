Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space.

First, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so it's a convex combination of projectors.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, isn't this the maximally mixed state for a qubit? Because it's an equal mixture of the two basis states.

I think the maximally mixed state is represented in the Bloch sphere as the completely depolarized state. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center of the Bloch sphere, right? Because it's as mixed as possible.

So the Bloch vector r for a qubit's state is usually given by the parameters in the density matrix. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector). When r is zero, that means ρ is (I)/2, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Oh wait, that's exactly the given ρ in the problem. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense because, for example, option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |1⟩, but that's a pure state, not a mixed state. Option A is (1,1,0), which I don't think corresponds to any standard state. Option D is (1,1,1), which would be a point beyond the surface of the Bloch sphere, which has a radius of 1, so that's impossible.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right),
\]

which represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) describes the geometric position of a qubit's state. For a maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A (\( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \))**: This does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **Option B (\( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \))**: This represents a pure state \( |1\rangle \), not a mixed state.
- **Option C (\( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \))**: This correctly represents the maximally mixed state.
- **Option D (\( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \))**: This is outside the Bloch sphere, which has a radius of 1, and is therefore invalid.

The correct answer is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Answer: C
