Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which I remember is a type of pericyclic reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is heated. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, let me think about what I know. [4+2] cycloadditions are typically Diels-Alder reactions, right? They involve a diene and a dienophile. The exo rule says that the endo transition state is favored, but wait, I think the question is asking about the exo product. Or maybe it's about the endo product. Wait, the question says 'EXO product'. Oh wait, no, wait—exo and endo in Diels-Alder refer to the transition state. The endo rule suggests that the endo transition state is more favorable, leading to the endo product. But sometimes, especially under certain conditions, the exo product can form. But in this case, the reaction is heated. Hmm, I'm not sure if that affects whether exo or endo is formed. Or maybe the question is about the stereochemistry of the adduct, not the endo/exo rule for transition states.

Wait, perhaps I should first determine the diene and dienophile here. 2,5-dimethylthiophene—thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with two double bonds. But 2,5-dimethylthiophene would have substituents on carbons 2 and 5, which are adjacent to the sulfur. When it's part of a Diels-Alder reaction, would it act as a diene or a dienophile? Thiophene is an aromatic compound, but when it's in a non-aromatic state, it can be a diene. Wait, but under heat, maybe it can undergo some change.

Alternatively, furan-2,5-dione is another name for 2,5-furandione. Furan is a dienophile in many Diels-Alder reactions. So I think in this case, 2,5-furandione is the dienophile, and 2,5-dimethylthiophene
