Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They're asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Hydrogen emits or absorbs at this wavelength, right? So when these clouds absorb the quasar's light, they imprint a absorption line at 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the telescopes we're talking about here are optical, ground-based. So optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the absorption line is in the UV, how can it be detected by optical telescopes unless it's shifted into the optical range?

Oh, right! Redshift. The absorption line's wavelength gets stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So for the 1216 Angstrom line to be visible in optical light, the redshift must be such that it moves this wavelength into the visible spectrum.

What's the visible spectrum range? I think it's about 400-700 nm, but wait, the question uses Angstroms. Let me convert that. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Angstroms) needs to be redshifted into the optical, which is above 4000 Angstroms. So the redshift z should satisfy:

observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z)

So, 1216 * (1 + z) >= 4000.

Let me solve for z.

1 + z >= 4000 / 1216.

Calculating that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So 1 + z ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum redshift where the line enters the optical is when the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms. So z ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest lower limit would be just above 2.29. Let's look at the choices. Option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so that would place the observed wavelength below 4000 Angstroms (still in UV, which optical telescopes can't see). So the lower limit should be around 2.29, so the minimum z is just above that.

Wait, but wait. I'm assuming that the lower limit is when it just enters the optical. So the minimum z is 2.29, so any z above that would be detectable. So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift; the object must have a redshift higher than that to be detected.

So the options given are:

A) 3 → z=3 → 1216*(1+3)=4864 Angstroms which is about 486 nm, blue-green.

B) 1.2 → 1216*2.2=2675.2 Angstroms → 267.5 nm, still UV.

C) 2.4 → 1216*3.4=4134.4 → 413 nm, blue.

D) 1.9 → 1216*2.9=3526.4 → 352.6 nm, UV. So optical telescopes can't see that.

Wait, wait. Because ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths below about 300 nm. So the Lyman limit is around 91 nm, but that's not relevant here. So if the observed wavelength is in the optical (say, above 400 nm or 4000 Angstroms), then the object is detectable.

So for z=2.29, the wavelength is 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So any object with z >= 2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So the lower limit would be z=2.29, so the minimum z is just over that.

Looking at the options,
