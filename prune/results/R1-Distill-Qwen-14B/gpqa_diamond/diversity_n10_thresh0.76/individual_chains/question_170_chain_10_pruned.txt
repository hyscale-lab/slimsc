Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. 

Hmm, the given state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component spinor. So in Dirac notation, it's probably |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T, right? And the operator for S_y is given, which is sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, wait, sigma matrices are often scaled by ħ/2 for spin operators. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix sigma_y.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I remember that the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Let me write down the steps. First, the expectation value formula. So I need to compute the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiply by S_y, then multiply by the state vector. 

The state vector is [3i, 4]^T. Its conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4* ]^T? Wait, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait. 3i is the top component. Its conjugate is -3i
