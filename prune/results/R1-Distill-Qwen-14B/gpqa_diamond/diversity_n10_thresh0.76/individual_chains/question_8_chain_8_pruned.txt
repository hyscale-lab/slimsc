Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

So the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each—g1, g2, g3—and also some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes.

They tested these mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The control is 100% resistance. The mutants have varying levels: g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, the double mutants are 10%, 0%, 0% respectively.

The question is about the interaction among these genes. The options are all about which gene is a transcription factor, whether others show pleiotropy or redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Hmm. So first, I need to understand what the phenotypes mean. Lower resistance means more susceptibility. So higher numbers are better (more resistant).

Looking at the single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less than control, but more than some others.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So knocking out G2 removes all resistance.
- g3: 50% → also less resistance than wild type.

So in the single mutants, the most severe is g2. That suggests that G2 might be a key gene. Since knocking it out completely abolishes resistance, perhaps it's a transcription factor that's essential for the resistance pathway.

The double mutants:
- g1g2: 0%. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. Same as g2 alone.
- g1g3: 10% → very low, but higher than 0.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.

So what's the epistasis here? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that might suggest that gene is epistatic.

Looking at g2g3: 0% resistance. But g3 alone is 50%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is halved, but when G2 is also knocked out, it's 0. Hmm. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G3. Because without G2, even if G3 is present, it can't function. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let's think. If the presence of a gene downstream depends on an upstream gene, then the upstream gene is epistatic. So if the phenotype of g2g3 is same as g2, perhaps G2 is upstream of G3.

For example, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3, then without G2, G3 can't be expressed, so knocking out G3 doesn't matter because it's not working anyway. So the resistance in g2g3 would be same as g2.

Same with g1g2: 0% resistance. Since g2 is already 0%, adding g1 doesn't change it. So that suggests that G2 is upstream. But why would g1g2 be same as g2? Maybe because without G2, G1 can't do anything. So perhaps both G1 and G2 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream. So when G2 is knocked out, even if G1 is present, resistance is lost.

Another point: the single mutant g2 has 0%, which is the most severe. That suggests G2 is essential for resistance. So perhaps it's a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 or G3.

Looking at g3 alone: 50% resistance. So G3's product contributes to resistance, but only half as much as the wild type. So if G3 is a downstream gene of G2, then without G2, even if G3 is present, it can't function. So in g2g3, the resistance is same as g2, which is 0% → so that's consistent with G2 being upstream.

Another double mutant: g1g3 is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is 10% (which is lower than g3 alone
