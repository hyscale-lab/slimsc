Okay, so I have this physics problem about diffraction. Hmm, let me read it again. The setup is an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is coming along the z-axis and falling vertically on the aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, right, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides approximates a circle. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture. But wait, the options include some numbers I remember from the single-slit diffraction. Like the first minimum at θ ≈ λ/(a), but wait, no, the first minimum in single-slit is λ/(a sin(theta)), but for a circle, maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different from a single slit. The single-slit formula is for a slit which is effectively a rectangular aperture. But a circular aperture leads to a different pattern, like the Airy disk. The minima in the Airy disk occur at specific angles where the Bessel functions of the first kind have zeros.

The first minimum for the circular aperture is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (π a). Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. I remember that the first dark ring in the Airy pattern occurs at θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. Oh, because the radius is a, so diameter is 2a. So θ = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a. Wait, that's option A: 0.610 λ/a.

But wait, wait again. The problem says when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes a circle, but we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, but in the far field, the diffraction pattern's central maximum is surrounded by rings. Each ring corresponds to higher order minima. So the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(π a) or something else?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the formula. The minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function J1 has zeros. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, but wait, in the context of the circular aperture, the condition is a sinθ = (m + 1/2) λ, where m is the order? No, wait, more accurately, the minima for the circular aperture occur when a sinθ = (p) λ, where p is the p-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the condition for the minima in the far field is given by a sinθ = (p) λ/(2), where p is the order of the zero.
