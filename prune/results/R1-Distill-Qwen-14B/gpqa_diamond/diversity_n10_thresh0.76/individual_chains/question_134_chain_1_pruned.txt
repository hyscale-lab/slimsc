Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, but I guess when there are multiple reactions or different concentrations, I need to calculate it.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait—HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When they mix, they'll neutralize each other.

I think the first thing I should do is figure out the moles of each acid and base. Because neutralization depends on how much acid and base you have.

So, let's start with the HCl. It's 500 mL of 0.2 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl.

Next, the H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So, 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. But each mole gives two moles of H+, so that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, but wait a second, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+. So HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. It's 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each mole gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Since each mole gives two OH-, that's 0.2 moles of OH-.

So, now I have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about -57 kJ (or sometimes -57.3 kJ, but the exact value might matter here). 

Wait, but wait again. Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it reacts with a base, only the first dissociation is complete (since it's a strong acid), right? Wait, no. H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Actually, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ ionization: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-. The second ionization is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is weaker, but in the presence of a strong base, I think the second H+ might also react. Hmm, but in neutralization with a strong base, perhaps all the H+ from the acids will be neutralized.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, no. Because when you mix H2SO4 (a diprotic acid) with a base, each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So, when considering neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can contribute two moles of H+ for neutralization.

Wait, but in solution, the first H+ is completely ionized, and the second may not be, but in a neutralization reaction with a strong base, maybe the base will deprotonate both H+ ions from H2SO4. Or perhaps in this problem, we can assume that all H+ ions are neutralized regardless of source.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of H2SO4, since it's a diprotic acid, each mole can contribute two H+ ions. So for 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

So combining HCl and H2SO4, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the neutralization equation is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases (say) 57.3 kJ of heat. But since this is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative.

Now, let's find out which is the limiting reactant. The H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ after reaction is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles
