Okay, let's try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. I need to go step by step through each reaction.

First, the initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure is a bicyclic compound with an oxygen-containing group.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and when dibromomethyl groups are present, this sounds like a nucleophilic substitution reaction, probably an SN2. But wait, the molecule has two dibromomethyl groups, so maybe each can undergo substitution.

Wait, the starting material is a diene. When it reacts with sodium iodide, perhaps each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes substitution with iodide. Wait, but sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions. But if the molecule is a diene with two dibromomethyl groups, maybe each Br is replaced by iodide. Or, wait, maybe the bromide leaves, and iodide comes in as the nucleophile. So each Br in the dibromomethyl groups would be replaced by iodide.

Wait, the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a cyclohexadiene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each substituent is a CH2Br2 group, right? So each of those has two bromines. So when sodium iodide is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by iodide. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? Or wait, maybe each Br is replaced in an SN2 reaction, but each substitution would require two equivalents of NaI. Wait, no, the question says 2 equivalents of the cyclohexene compound are used. Wait, but each molecule has two dibromomethyl groups, each with two Br atoms. So each molecule has four Br atoms. But the reaction uses 2 equivalents, so 4 equivalents of Br would be present. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant right now.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-diene diels-alder type reaction. Wait, maybe the bicyclo compound acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The other compound is a dienophile? Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a diene, perhaps, but maybe it can react in a different way. Or perhaps it's undergoing a coupling reaction. Alternatively, since the bicyclo compound has a bridge, maybe it's acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the other molecule.

Wait, but when sodium iodide is present, maybe it's a SN2 displacement. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening.
