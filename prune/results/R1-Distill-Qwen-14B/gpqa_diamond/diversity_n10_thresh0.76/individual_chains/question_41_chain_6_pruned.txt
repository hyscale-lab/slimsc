Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with lights and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity, but wait, this might not be a relativity problem since it's probably using the classical approach. Let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium... Normally, in a medium like glass, the speed is c/n, right? But when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed? Or is it that the speed of light in the medium is always c/n, regardless of the medium's motion?

Wait, wait, in classical physics, when you have a source moving, you might use Galilean transformations. So maybe I need to consider how the speed adds up when the medium is moving. Let me recall that.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer. So the light's speed should be the speed in the glass frame plus the glass's velocity, but wait, direction matters.

The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction. Wait, but light is moving through the glass which is itself moving. So in the lab frame, the speed of the light is the speed of light in the glass plus the speed of the glass, but only if they are in the same direction.

Wait, no, that's probably not right. Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but in the medium's frame. So when the medium is moving, the lab frame would observe the light's speed as (c/n) + v. But wait, no, because light's speed is independent of the source's motion in reality. But this is a classical approach, so maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about how the speed is calculated when moving through
