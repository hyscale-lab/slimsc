Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Alright, let me break it down.

So, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³. Wait, cm³ is the same as mL, right? So the volume is 200 mL. That's 0.2 liters because 1000 mL is a liter. Wait, wait, no, 200 mL is 0.2 L? No, wait, 200 divided by 1000 is 0.2. Oh yes, that's right.

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium phosphate. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium phosphate.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, I think. Or wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully protonated form. But in solution, it can dissociate into H2PO4⁻, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4⁻ (first dissociation), then HPO4^2- (second), and finally PO4^3- (third). So orthophosphate might refer to the H3PO4, but I'm not entirely sure. Or sometimes it's used interchangeably with phosphate ions. Hmm, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Maybe that refers to the HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the problem. The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. So when it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-. Right, because K is a +1 ion and H2PO4 is -1.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So when it dissolves, the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So each formula unit gives two Na+ ions and one HPO4^2- ion. So the dissociation would be 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the mixture contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, in solution, these can undergo further dissociation or possibly some kind of equilibria. So the solution is a buffer solution because it has a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, but H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 can donate a proton to become H2PO4^-). Similarly, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-. So in this solution, since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps they can interconvert.

Wait, but what about the third dissociation? HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-, but the Ka3 is very small (1.8e-12), so that's probably negligible in this context.

So, the main species we have are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Since these are in solution, they can form a buffer. So to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-, we can calculate their total concentration.

Wait, but wait. The orthophosphate ion is H3PO4, but in solution, it's more about the different forms. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-? No, I think in the context of these salts, the orthophosphate would be HPO4^2-.

But perhaps I should figure out the concentrations of each ion first.

Let me calculate the moles of each salt.

First, for KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

So, K+ is 0.007336 mol, and H2PO4^- is 0.007336 mol.

Then, Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 2 moles Na+ and 1 mole HPO4^2-. So HPO4^2- is 0.005606 mol.

So, in solution, the total volume is 200 mL or 0.2 L.

So, the concentration of H2PO4^- is moles / volume = 0.007336 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03668 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005606 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02803 M.

So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but these can react with water. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2- and H+. Or, HPO4^2- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become PO4^3- and H+. But since the solution is a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), it's a buffer solution.

The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the relevant pKa values.

Wait, the given Ka values are for H3PO4. So:

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈ 11.74

Now, the H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (since H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-). So the pKa for that is pKa1.

The HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (since H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-), so the pKa for that is pKa2.

So, in the solution, the buffer is formed between H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base), so we should use the pKa2 (7.21) in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

Wait, but in the Henderson equation, [base] is the concentration of the conjugate base, and [acid] is the concentration of the weak acid. So in this case, H2PO4^- is the acid (can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the base (can accept a proton from H2PO4^-).

So, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So [base] is [HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M.

[acid] is [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M.

So, pH = 7.21 + log(0.02803 / 0.03668)

Calculate the ratio: 0.02803 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7647

Log(0.7647) is approximately log(7.647e-1) → log(0.7647) ≈ -0.113.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.113 = 7.097.

Hmm, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So what is orthophosphate here?

Orthophosphate usually refers to the H3PO4 molecule, but in solution, that's not present except for a tiny amount due to the third dissociation.

Wait, but in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it's mostly deprotonated. So perhaps the concentration of orthophosphate is minimal, but wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which might refer to PO4^3-.

Wait, but that's the third dissociation, which has a very low Ka3 (1.8e-12). So PO4^3- concentration would be very low, since the solution's pH is around 7.1, which is below pKa3 (11.74).

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the phosphate species. The three dissociation steps are:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1=7.5e-3)

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02803 M and H2PO4^- is 0.03668 M. But these are their initial concentrations from the salts. But in solution, they can interconvert.

Wait, but I calculated the pH as around 7.1, which is between pKa1 and pKa2. But wait, pKa1 is 2.12, pKa2 is 7.21, so pH of 7.1 is just below pKa2.

So in this solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-.

But because the pH is slightly below pKa2, the HPO4^2- concentration will be slightly less than the H2PO4^- concentration, but that's already accounted for in the buffer calculation.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then its concentration is determined by the third dissociation, which is minimal.

Alternatively, orthophosphate might refer to HPO4^2-, but I'm a bit confused about that terminology.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the concentration of HPO4^2- plus H2PO4^- plus H3PO4, but that doesn't make much sense because H3PO4 is negligible compared to the others.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. Another thought: perhaps orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. So the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, in the solution, you have some HPO4^2- from the sodium salt, and some H2PO4^- from the potassium salt. But in solution, some HPO4^2- could come from the dissociation of H2PO4^- and vice versa.

But given the pH is slightly below pKa2, the HPO4^2- concentration will be a little less than what's initially present, but perhaps we can approximate it as the sum of the initial concentrations.

Wait, no. Because the H2PO4^- can lose a H+ to become HPO4^2-.

So, another approach: perhaps find the total phosphate concentration, considering all the species.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- (orthophosphate ions) in the solution, considering the buffer.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is given by the Henderson equation.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson equation gives us pH, but maybe in this case, we can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-].

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the system.

Let me think. The solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8).

So, in the solution, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M

But in reality, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will accept a proton from H+ to become H2PO4^-.

But given that pH is close to pKa2, the extent of this change is significant, but perhaps not too much.

But to find the exact [HPO4^2-], perhaps it's better to set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me denote the concentrations as follows:

Let x be the concentration of H+ (since H+ is a part of the solution's pH, which we found to be about 7.1).

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = Ka2 / [H+]

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So, [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH - pKa2)

We have pH ≈7.097, pKa2=7.21.

So 7.097 -7.21 = -0.113.

10^(-0.113) ≈ 0.775.

So [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.775.

So, let's let [HPO4^2-] = 0.775 * [H2PO4^-].

But initially, [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.03668 + 0.02803 ≈ 0.06471 M.

Wait, no, because each salt contributes only H2PO4^- or HPO4^2-.

Wait, the initial moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.007336 and 0.005606 respectively. So total initial phosphate from both is 0.012942 mol in 0.2 L, so 0.06471 M.

But in solution, they can interconvert depending on pH.

So, let me denote the concentrations after dissociation as:

[H2PO4^-] = a

[HPO4^2-] = b

So, we have:

a + b = 0.06471 (because the total phosphate comes from the salts, and no other sources or losses)

And from the Henderson equation:

b/a = 0.775

So, substituting b = 0.775 a into a + 0.775a = 0.06471 → 1.775 a = 0.06471 → a = 0.06471 / 1.775 ≈ 0.03644 M

So, [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.03644 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.775 * 0.03644 ≈ 0.02813 M

Wait, but that's very close to the initial concentrations. So, perhaps the dissociation doesn't change the concentrations much. Because the pH is just a bit below pKa2, so the ratio is close to 1. So our initial approximation might be okay.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.02803 M, but after considering the buffer, it's about 0.02813 M. So, negligible change.

Wait, but why is that? Because the initial concentrations are already at a ratio of 0.02803 /0.03668 ≈ 0.7647, and the Henderson equation gives a ratio of 0.775, which is close. So the change would be minimal, and the initial [HPO4^2-] is about correct.

Therefore, the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.0280 M, but wait, the initial calculation was 0.02803 M, and after Henderson, it's 0.02813 M. So, it's about 0.02803 M.

But wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02803 M. But wait, this is 0.02803 M, which is 2.803e-2 M. Looking at the options, the choices are on the order of 1e-7 M. That doesn't match. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, no, I must have made a mistake. Because the options are in the 1e-7 M range, but my calculation gives 0.028 M, which is way higher. So I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, maybe the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which would be much lower, given that Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion refers to H3PO4, which is the fully protonated form. But in solution, H3PO4 is not present in significant amounts because it's a weak acid and the solution is at pH ~7.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the orthophosphate ion is the conjugate base, which is PO4^3-.

But in that case, the concentration would be calculated using the third dissociation.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the third dissociation product.

Let me think about that.

HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the pH.

So, the expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028 M, and [H+] can be found from the pH we calculated earlier.

pH is approximately 7.1, so [H+] = 10^(-7.1) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / 7.94e-8

Let me compute that.

First, 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.0454e-14.

Then, divide by 7.94e-8:

5.0454e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.35e-7 M.

Hmm, 6.35e-7 M is option A (6.24e-7) or option D (3.97e-7). Hmm, close to option A. But wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate the pH. Earlier, I approximated the pH as 7.097. Let me redo that more accurately.

In the Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M.

So the ratio is 0.02803 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7647.

Log(0.7647) is approximately:

Log(0.76) is about -0.117, but let me compute it more accurately.

Log(0.7647) = ?

Well, 10^(-0.113) = 0.775 (as I had before). Wait, but 0.7647 is a bit less than 0.775. Let me compute it more accurately using a calculator approach.

Using logarithm properties:

Log(0.7647) = log(7.647e-1) = log(7.647) - 1 ≈ 0.8843 - 1 = -0.1157.

So pH = 7.21 -0.1157 ≈7.0943.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0943) ≈ 7.99e-8 M.

Now, let's recalculate [PO4^3-]:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (7.99e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.0454e-14.

Denominator: 7.99e-8.

5.0454e-14 / 7.99e-8 ≈ 6.315e-7 M.

So, approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to this value.

But wait, maybe I need to account for activity coefficients or something, but I don't think that's expected here. So the answer should be around 6.3e-7 M, which is closest to option A.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total orthophosphate concentration, which includes all forms. But that doesn't seem to fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining which species is orthophosphate. If orthophosphate is H3PO4, then its concentration is negligible because it's a weak acid and would mostly dissociate.

Wait, but in solution, H3PO4 can dissociate into H+ and H2PO4^- with Ka1 =7.5e-3. So, if the solution's pH is 7.1, which is much higher than pKa1 (2.12), the concentration of H3PO4 would be very low.

But the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to PO4^3-.

Wait, but the calculation gave [PO4^3-] ≈6.3e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7).

But I'm a bit confused because another approach might lead to a different result.

Wait, another approach: maybe the solution's pH is such that the third dissociation is minimal, but how else could the orthophosphate ion's concentration be determined?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the solution's orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

Wait, but in that case, our earlier calculation is correct.

So I think the answer should be option A, 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibrium of the phosphate species. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation reactions are:

1. **KH₂PO₄ → K⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻**  
   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \).

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O → 2Na⁺ + HPO₄²⁻**  
   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005606 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005606}{0.2} \approx 0.02803 \, \text{M} \).

The solution is a buffer containing H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the relevant equilibrium for the second dissociation of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻} \quad (\text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}, \, \text{pKa}_2 = 7.21).
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right),
\]  
we calculate the ratio of concentrations:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = 10^{\text{pH} - \text{pKa}_2}.
\]  
From the initial concentrations, \( [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.02803 \, \text{M} \) and \( [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = 0.03668 \, \text{M} \), the ratio is \( \frac{0.02803}{0.03668} \approx 0.7647 \).  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.7647) \approx 7.21 - 0.113 = 7.097.
\]

The pH of the solution is approximately 7.097. Using this pH, the concentration of H⁺ is:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.097} \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻, which arises from the third dissociation:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻} \quad (\text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}).
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]} \implies [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803)}{7.94 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.045 \times 10^{-14}}{7.94 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.35 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

This value is closest to option **A (6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M)**. Therefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**.

ANSWER: A
