Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but given the reactions, I think it's more likely propene. Because cyclopropane is less reactive in some of the reactions mentioned, perhaps. Let's proceed.

Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, that's a typical bromination condition for alkenes. So if A is propene, then bromination would add bromine across the double bond. The product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. Because propene (CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3) would react with Br2 to form CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, but wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, when alkenes react with Br2, it's an addition reaction. So if propene is CH2=CH2CH3, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. But wait, wait, actually propene is CH2=CHCH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as (CH2Br)CHBrCH3? No, wait, maybe it's 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2CH2Br? No, no, no. Wait, when Br2 adds to a double bond, it adds across the two carbons. So for propene, which is CH2=CHCH3, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So adding Br2 would add Br to each of those, leading to CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Yeah, that's correct. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's an elimination reaction. So B is a di-substituted dibromide. When you treat 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH, it should undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but which H gets removed? Since it's 1,2-dibrom
