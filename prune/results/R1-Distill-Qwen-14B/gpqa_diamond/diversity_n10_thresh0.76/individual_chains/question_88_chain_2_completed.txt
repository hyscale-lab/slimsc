Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then, through in vivo imaging, they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which would break down proteins, right? So those proteins probably didn't make it through. But some of them were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs are like places where immune responses happen, like lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, etc.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches. Wait, Peyer patches are these small structures in the intestinal wall that are part of the immune system. So when the GFP-tagged proteins got to the Peyer patches, they isolated the proliferating cells there. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and found high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that something has happened to diversify the genes, probably in the immune response.

So what's happening here? Let me think about the immune processes. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination is during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, where the V, D, and J segments are combined. But that's during the development of B cells in the marrow, not after they've already started responding.

Somatic hypermutation occurs in mature B cells in places like the germinal centers. It's where the variable regions of the B cell receptors are mutated, increasing diversity to help recognize more antigens. This process happens after T cell dependent activation, I think, which leads to the high variability in the variable heavy chain.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. But that doesn't directly cause variability in the B cell genes.

Class switching recombination is when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It's initiated by certain signals, but it doesn't change the variable regions, just the constant region. So that wouldn't explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

In this experiment, the GFP-tagged proteins probably acted as an antigen. The B cells in the Peyer patches (which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue) would take up the antigen. Then, during an immune response, B cells that recognize the antigen would proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation. That mutation increases the diversity of their receptors, making them more effective at binding the antigen.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences is due to somatic hypermutation. That points to option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. The fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, which suggests a process that diversifies immune receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where mature B cells undergo mutations in the variable regions of their receptors to increase diversity. This explains the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly cause variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during the initial development of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, not during the immune response after antigen recognition.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences is consistent with somatic hypermutation, which occurs in response to antigen recognition and drives diversification of B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
