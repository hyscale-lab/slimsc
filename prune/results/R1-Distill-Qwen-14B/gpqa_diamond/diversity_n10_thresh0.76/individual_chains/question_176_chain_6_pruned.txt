Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. So the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. The system's state is given as a column matrix, and there are matrices for the operators P and Q. Let me try to unpack this.

Wait, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). I think I need to normalize this because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. So I should compute the norm first. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is this divided by sqrt(6). So it's [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the operator P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, wait, that's a symmetric matrix, so maybe it's diagonalizable. I wonder what its eigenvalues are. But perhaps I don't need the eigenvalues right now. The operator Q has a diagonal matrix with elements (1, 0, -1) on the diagonal.

Wait, the question is about measuring P first, then Q. But wait no, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the measurement sequence is P first, then Q. We need the probability that P gives 0 and Q gives -1.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So when you measure P first and get a certain value, the state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to that value. Then, when you measure Q, you project onto eigenstates of Q, but perhaps the order matters.

Wait, no, the question isn't entirely clear on whether it's P measured first, then Q, or the other way around. Wait, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the order is P first, then Q.

But wait, I think the question is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So the first measurement is P, and the outcome is 0. Then the second measurement is Q, with outcome -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state after the first measurement (P) will collapse into an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue of P that was measured. Then, the second measurement (Q) will be taken on this collapsed state. So the overall probability is the sum over all possible eigenstates of P that correspond to eigenvalue 0, of the probability of collapsing into that state, multiplied by the probability of then getting -1 when measuring Q.

But wait, first I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because when you measure P and get 0, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0.

So let me find the eigenvalues of operator P. Because then I can find the eigenvalue 0 and its eigenvectors.

So operator P is a 3x3 matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

I can write this as:

[ 0      a       0 ]
[ a      0       a ]
[ 0      a       0 ]

where a is 1/sqrt(2
