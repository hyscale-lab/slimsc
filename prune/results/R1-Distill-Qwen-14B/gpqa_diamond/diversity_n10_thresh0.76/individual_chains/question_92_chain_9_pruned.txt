Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule. Hmm, let's see. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. Oh, right, it's a diene or something with multiple double bonds? I'm not exactly sure, but I'll get into that.

The question provides some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, probably I need to calculate the total energy of the bonds broken and the bonds formed to find the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but wait. The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

But wait, I think I might have that reversed. Oh no, no, wait. No, generally, the enthalpy change is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Because when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, and when bonds are formed, energy is released.

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, I've heard that the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to form the molecule from its elements.
