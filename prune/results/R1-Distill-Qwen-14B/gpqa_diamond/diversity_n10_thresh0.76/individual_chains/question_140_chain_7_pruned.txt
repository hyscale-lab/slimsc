Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack the question and see what each part is telling me.

The problem starts by talking about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X is probably an element that has isotopes. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so for a gas molecule where protons and neutrons are equal, that's a hint. Maybe W is something like H2O2? Wait, no, because H2O2's molecule isn't just a single atom. Oh wait, perhaps W is a noble gas? Let me think. For noble gases, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons? Let me see, neon has 10 protons and 10 neutrons? No, wait, neon has 10 protons and 10 neutrons in the most common isotope, but actually, Neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So, if W is neon, then a molecule (but wait, noble gases are monoatomic; so maybe W is Ne, which is a monoatomic gas. So in that case, the molecule has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. So that fits.

So, gas W would be Ne, I think. So when X reacts with Y, gas W is released. What's the reaction? Violently, so perhaps an acid reacting with a carbonate? Wait, but the reaction with a carbonate would produce CO2 and water. Hmm, wait, but if W is Ne, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe Y is water and X is something that upon reaction produces Ne. But that seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid and X is a metal, but then the gas would probably be H2. Hmm.

Wait, the problem also mentions that a precipitate G forms when X and Y react. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Let me check what 277 K is in Celsius. 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius, roughly. Hmm, which substances have a melting point around there? Well, water freezes at 273 K (0째C), so 277 K is about +4째C. What's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is something like ice? But 273 K is 0째C, and 277 is +4, so it's a bit higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium chloride. No, NaCl melts at 801째C. Hmm. Or maybe something else. Let's think about what substances melt near 277 K. Wait, water's melting point is 273.15 K, so 277 is a bit higher. That suggests maybe another substance. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrated salt that releases water when heated. Hmm.

Wait, when G is heated, B
