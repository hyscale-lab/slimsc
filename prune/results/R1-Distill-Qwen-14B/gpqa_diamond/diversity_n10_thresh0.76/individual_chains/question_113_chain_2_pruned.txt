Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and figure out the steps to approach it.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygens.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because the O-H stretch is broad due to hydrogen bonding. So that suggests the compound has an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what functional groups do those correspond to?

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But the 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower than the usual for a ketone, which is around 1715 maybe. Wait, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretching or maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in an ester or amide. But since the broad peak suggests an -OH, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have both C=O and sometimes an -OH (like in carboxylic esters) but wait, no. Ester's carbonyl is around 1700-1750. If there's a peak at 1700 and another at 1650, maybe it's an ester plus something else. Or perhaps conjugated carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic C-H stretches are around 3000, but the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (maybe with substituents). But the broad peak is more about O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the
