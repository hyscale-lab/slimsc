Alright, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that optical activity arises when a compound has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, the key here is to check each compound and see if it has any such centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   The structure of this is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second. The substituents on the double bond are Cl on C1 and CH2CH3 on C2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl, CH2CH2 (from the butene part?), maybe a methyl and the double bond. Hmm, actually, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the structure is CHCl=C(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me draw it.

   For 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but wait, that's not right. No, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be Cl at the first carbon. So structure is ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait but it's but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH3, but first carbon is CH2Cl. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

   Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on the first carbon with Cl. So it becomes ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, but that's single bonds. Oh wait, it's but-1-ene, so structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but that would be butane
