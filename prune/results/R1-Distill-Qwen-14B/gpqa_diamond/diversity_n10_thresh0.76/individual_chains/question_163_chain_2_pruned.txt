Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. To dissolve it, a strong acid would react with it. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, the reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. So the reaction equation would be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Wait, is that right? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with an acid (H+), it should neutralize. Each Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would react with 3 moles of H+.

So the balanced equation would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yeah, that sounds right.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 mol, which is about 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from the acid), the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter. Wait, the volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters. But wait, the acid volume is what I'm trying to find. Let me call the volume of acid V (in liters). So moles of H+ from acid is 0.1 M * V.

Wait, but the total volume of the solution after adding the acid is 100 cm³, right? Because the question says "in 100 cm³ total volume." So the acid is added to the solution, but the total volume is fixed at 100 cm³. Hmm, but wait, that might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acid is added, but the total solution volume becomes 100 cm³. So the acid volume is V, and the rest is made up with water? Or maybe the 100 cm³ includes the acid and the Fe(OH)3. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving will have a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid is part of this 100 cm³. Oh, wait no, the acid is what's used to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, but
