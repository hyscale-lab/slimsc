Okay, so I've got this question about electrochemistry, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the oxidizing power of oxygen in different solutions—basic and acidic. It also talks about the kinetic aspect of how fast oxygen reacts in acidic solutions. Hmm, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its standard electrode potential. The higher the potential, the stronger the oxidant.

So the first part is about thermodynamics. In basic solutions, oxygen is a ... oxidant. Wait, what's the standard reduction potential for oxygen? I think in acidic solution, O2 is reduced to water. The standard potential for that reaction is around +1.23 V, which is quite high, so O2 is a strong oxidant. But wait, in basic solution, the same reaction probably has a different potential. Oh right, because in basic conditions, the H+ concentration is low. So the reaction would involve OH- instead.

The standard reaction in basic would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. The standard potential for this is also about +0.401 V. Wait, but I thought in acidic it's higher, meaning it's a stronger oxidant when in acidic conditions? Or wait, no—because the potential is higher in acidic, so O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic solution compared to basic? Or wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the higher the reduction potential, the more likely the substance is to be reduced, so it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So in acidic solution, O2 has a higher E°, so it's a stronger oxidant. In basic, its E° is lower, so it's a weaker oxidant. So the first blank should be "weaker" because in basic solution, oxygen's oxidizing power is less than in acidic.

Wait, but wait, the statement says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ... oxidant in basic solutions." So in basic solutions, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant compared to its acidic form? Since the E° is lower in basic (0.401 V) compared to acidic (1.23 V), O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. So the first blank is 'weaker'.

Now the second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts ... in acidic solutions. Kinetics relates to reaction rate. So even if something is thermodynamically favorable, it may not happen quickly because of activation energy.

Wait, in acidic solution, O2 might have a higher tendency to react because the environment is more conducive for the reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. Hmm. Let's think about the reaction rates.

I remember that in acidic conditions, the reaction of O2 might be faster or slower. Wait, what's the standard reaction for O2 as an oxidant? In acidic, it's O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. The reverse reaction is the oxidation, but when O2 is acting as an oxidant, it's the reduction. So the reaction's kinetics can be influenced by the concentration of H+.

In acidic solutions, the concentration of H+ is higher, which could make the reaction proceed faster. Or does it? Wait, maybe the catalysis affects it. Wait, but O2 is a good oxidant in acidic solutions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is slower because of the higher H+ concentration? No, I don't think that's right.

Wait, another angle. The basic solution has OH- ions, which can affect the reaction rate. Maybe O2 reacts faster in acidic because H+ could help stabilize the transition state or something. Or maybe in acidic conditions, the reaction has a lower activation energy, making it faster.

Alternatively, let me think about real reactions. For example, the corrosion of metals. In acidic environments, metals tend to corrode faster because H+ ions can contribute to the reaction. So maybe the reaction of O2 in acidic is faster.

Wait, but the question is about O2 as an oxidant. So when O2 is acting as an oxidant, it's being reduced. So the reaction's rate depends on the conditions. In acidic, the reaction is more favorable thermodynamically, but does that mean it's faster kinetically?

Wait, another approach: the standard electrode potentials give the thermodynamic feasibility, but kinetics is about the rate. So even if a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it may not proceed quickly because of high activation energy.

But in this case, the question is about whether O2 reacts faster or slower kinetically in acidic solutions. So in acidic, the solution is H+ rich. The reaction O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. So the presence of H+ can influence the reaction rate. Maybe because H+ can stabilize the transition state, making the reaction proceed faster.

Alternatively, if the reaction in acidic has a higher current or better kinetics, it might proceed faster.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are combinations of weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

So the first part is about thermodynamic strength. O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions, so the first part is 'weaker'.

The second part is about kinetic speed in acidic. So the second part is 'faster' because in acidic, the reaction is more kinetically favorable. Or is it not?

Wait, wait. Another thought: in basic solution, the O2 reaction might be slower because OH- is a weaker acid than H2O, so maybe the reaction is less likely to proceed as quickly. Alternatively, the presence of H+ in acidic could make the reaction go faster.

I think I remember that O2 can be a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions because of higher H+ concentration, which helps in the reaction, making it a stronger oxidant. But that's about thermodynamics, not kinetics.

Now, for kinetics, maybe O2 reacts faster in acidic because the reaction conditions (like H+ concentration) make the rate higher. So the second blank would be 'faster'.

So putting it together: the first part is weaker (because in basic, E° is lower), and the second part is faster (in acidic, the reaction is faster kinetically). So looking at the options:

Option C is weaker – faster. Option A is stronger – faster. Option B is stronger – slower. Option D is weaker – slower.

So the correct option is C) weaker – faster.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because another approach might consider that the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable in acidic, but whether that translates to faster kinetics isn't directly determined by E°. Kinetics is about activation energy, which O2 might have a higher or lower activation energy in acidic.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is slower kinetically in acidic because O2 is a stronger oxidant, so the reverse reaction is less favored, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but another way to think: in acidic solutions, since O2 is a stronger oxidant, it's more likely to undergo reduction, which would mean the reaction is more spontaneous, but that doesn't directly tell about the speed. However, higher concentration of H+ can sometimes act as a catalyst, increasing the reaction rate.

Wait, perhaps in acidic conditions, the reaction of O2 is catalyzed by H+ ions, making the reaction proceed faster. So the kinetic part is faster in acidic.

So the correct combination is weaker (thermodynamic strength in basic) and faster (kinetic in acidic). That points to option C.


The question revolves around the oxidizing power of oxygen (O₂) in different solutions and its reaction kinetics. To determine the correct combination of terms, the following analysis is performed:

1. **Thermodynamic Aspect (Oxidizing Power):**  
   The oxidizing power of a substance is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). In acidic solutions, the reduction reaction of O₂ is:  
   \[
   \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \quad E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.
   \]  
   In basic solutions, the reaction becomes:  
   \[
   \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \quad E^\circ = +0.401 \, \text{V}.
   \]  
   Since the standard reduction potential is lower in basic solutions, O₂ is a **weaker oxidant** in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Aspect (Reaction Rate):**  
   Kinetics depends on factors like concentration of ions and activation energy. In acidic solutions, the high concentration of H⁺ ions can stabilize the transition state and facilitate the reaction, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, O₂ reacts **faster kinetically** in acidic solutions.

3. **Combining the Results:**  
   - Thermodynamically, O₂ is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
   - Kinetically, O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.  

Based on this analysis, the correct combination is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
