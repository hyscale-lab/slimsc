Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about an electron state |alpha> which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states for the z-axis.

The problem asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. 

The options given are A to D, each providing two probabilities and an average value. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably normalize the state |alpha>. Because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. So I'll find the normalization factor.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's write this as a vector in the basis |up>, |down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) for up and (2-i) for down.

The normalization is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

So, the magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, the magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5).

Wait no, wait. Actually, when you have a complex number a + bi, the magnitude is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So for (1+i), it's sqrt(1 +1) = sqrt(2). For (2-i), it's sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5).

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of [ (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 ].

Calculating that: (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, (sqrt(5))^2 is 5. 2+5=7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the probabilities depend on whether |alpha> is expressed as a combination of these eigenstates.

Wait, the operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with up and down), the matrix would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, wait no. Because for a 2x2, the diagonal elements are where i = j. So A11 = 0, A12 = hbar/2, A21 = hbar/2, A22=0.

So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That looks familiar. I think this is a spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], and the spin-x operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, which would be [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So yes, operator A is the spin-x operator.

The eigenstates of the spin-x operator are the eigenstates for measuring spin along the x-axis. These are the states |+x> and |-x>, right?

The eigenstates can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Because the spin-x operator's eigenstates are these superpositions.

So any state can be expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities of measuring spin along x as +1/2 ħ or -1/2 ħ.

So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value and the probabilities using the matrix representation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express |alpha> in the basis of A's eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probabilities by finding the overlap between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

So let's proceed.

First, find the eigenstates of A. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x> as above.

So,

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the inner products. The probability of measuring +x is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for |-x>.

So,

P(+x) = | < +x | alpha > |^2

Similarly for P(-x).

So let's compute < +x | alpha >.

First, < +x | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2)

And |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/iup> + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1) + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * (1) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, because <up|up> is 1, similarly for <down|down>.

So,

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator: (1 + 2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So,

= 3/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

Which is 3 / sqrt(14).

So the probability P(+x) is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857...

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, the numerator is 1+i + 2 - i. 1+2=3, and i -i=0. So yes, 3.

So < +x | alpha > is (3)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ), which is 3/sqrt(14).

So P(+x) is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, let's compute P(-x). So < -x | alpha >.

The state |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

< -x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2)

Simplify numerator:

1 +i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So,

( -1 + 2i ) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) )

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the magnitude: |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (14).

The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5). So squared is 5.

So P(-x) = 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but wait a second. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857 and 5/14 is approximately 0.35714. Wait, but 9+5=14, so that adds up to 1. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. That would be close to 9/14 (≈0.64
