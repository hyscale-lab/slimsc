Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me just read it again to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying, moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. So the initial setup is that with a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, only one third of the particles make it to the detector's inner walls. We need to find the gamma that would allow two-thirds to reach. 

I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Because if a particle decays quickly, it doesn't travel far. So a higher gamma means the particle lives longer from the lab frame's perspective because of time dilation. That would allow it to travel a longer distance before decaying, increasing the chance it reaches the detector walls.

Wait, but how does the fraction reaching the walls relate to gamma? I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is related to the lab frame lifetime (t) by t = gamma * tau. The distance the particle travels is v * t. But wait, since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D = v * t â‰ˆ c * gamma * tau.

The detector's radius is 30 meters, so the maximum distance a particle can travel to reach the wall is 30 meters. But wait, the problem says that one third reach the wall when gamma is 20. So I think the probability that the particle decays beyond a certain point relates to the ratio of the distance it travels compared to the maximum possible.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center, so to reach the wall they need to travel 30 meters. So the probability that a particle doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters is the fraction that reaches the wall.

The decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is P
