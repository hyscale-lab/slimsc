Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see...

The question says there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud with a spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, which I guess is 150 years each. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. From Earth's perspective, how long does it take, but the question is from the astronaut's point of view.

Wait, no, the question says "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read again: "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?" So the astronaut's own experienced time is what we're calculating.

Wait, but I remember that when you travel at speeds close to light speed, time dilation occurs. So from the astronaut's perspective, time slows down. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, no. Time dilation is a bit tricky. Let me think.

Time dilation occurs because of the effects of special relativity. When an object is moving at a high velocity relative to another frame, time passes slower for it. So from Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving very fast, so
