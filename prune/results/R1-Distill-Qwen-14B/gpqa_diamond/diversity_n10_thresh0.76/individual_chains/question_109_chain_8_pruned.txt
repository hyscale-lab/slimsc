Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron or something similar) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and there's this condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). 

Wait, wait. I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle comes into play with identical particles. But here, the system is the two nucleons (protons or neutrons?), and they're emitting a particle X. So the setup is that the initial state is 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN state has certain quantum numbers.

The question states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to determine which partial wave isn't allowed, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Let me note down the key points:

1. Initial state: NN is in a 1S0 state. So from the term symbol definition, (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0, S=0 (since 2*0 +1=1), L=0 (S in spectroscopic notation), and J=0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. And since it's a spin-singlet (S=0), the isospin isn't directly obvious, but the problem gives T(NN) = 0 in the final state.

2. Emission of particle X: X has intrinsic parity -1. So parity considerations will affect the process.

3. Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, T is isospin, S is the total spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and the equation relates these quantum numbers modulo 2.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. The Pauli exclusion principle for identical particles says that the total wavefunction must be anti-symmetric under exchange. For identical particles, their wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the overall parity might involve these.

Alternatively, for the NN system, the total wavefunction includes their orbital angular momentum (L), their spin (S), and their isospin (T). So the condition for Pauli might be about the symmetry of the wavefunction under exchange. But perhaps the formula given here is a rule of thumb for determining the possible quantum numbers.

The given condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, for the final state, T(NN) is 0. So, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L can't both be even or both be odd. One has to be even, the other odd.

Wait, more accurately: 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod 2 → S + L ≡ -1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1, meaning one is even and the other is odd.

Now, the partial waves refer to the orbital angular momentum (L) of the emitted particle X. The options give different L states for X, like S (l=0), P (l=1), D (l=2), F (l=3). So each option gives the orbital angular momentum of X, which is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system since angular momentum is conserved?

Wait, no. Wait, in the decay process, the initial state is NN in 1S0 (L=0), and they emit X. The final state would have NN in some state (L') and X in some state (l). So angular momentum must be conserved: the total initial angular momentum is J_initial = 0 (from 1S0). The final total angular momentum is the sum of the NN state's angular momentum and X's angular momentum.

Wait, but the angular momentum of the NN system (J') plus the angular momentum of X (j) must equal the initial total angular momentum, which is zero. So J' must equal the negative of j. But since angular momentum is quantized, J' and j must have the same magnitude but opposite direction. However, since we're dealing with quantum numbers, the possible L and l must satisfy L' + l = initial J. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the process. The initial state is NN in 1S0. So their orbital angular momentum L_initial is 0 (since it's S-state). Now, when they emit X, the
