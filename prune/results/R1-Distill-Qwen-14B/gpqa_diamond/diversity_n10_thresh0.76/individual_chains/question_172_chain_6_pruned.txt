Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. So the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I guess that means the usual statistical mechanics apply here.

Wait, in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the population of a particular energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-E/(k*T)), where E is the energy of the level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, let's call the two energy levels E1 and E2, but wait, actually the problem says the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. So the difference is delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. Or wait, wait, the question says that the energy difference is approximately that value. So I think the specific energy levels have a delta E of 1.38e-23 J.

So the excitation refers to the number of atoms in a particular energy level. Star 1 has twice as excited as star 2 for that level. Let me model this. Let's say N1 is the number of atoms in the excited state for star 1, and N2 for star 2. According to the problem, N1 = 2 * N2. Or wait, wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"â€”so maybe the excitation refers to the population of a higher energy level compared to a lower one. Oh wait, no. Excitation as in the energy state. So each atom has a certain probability to be in an excited state.

But wait, in the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the degeneracy. Assuming the energy levels are non-degenerate (g=1 for each), then the ratio N2/N1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), because E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive, so the exponential becomes exp( -delta E/(kT) ), where delta E is positive.

Wait, but in the problem, the specific energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for that specific energy level, the number of excited atoms (in that level) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait no, perhaps it's the ratio between two energy levels. Let's say the excited state is a higher energy level. So for each star, the number in the excited level N_high and the ground level N_low. The ratio
