Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it affects their overall temperature and emission. But how does that relate to the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels?

The question says that when a star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but waitâ€”does that mean the spots are cooler? Because if the overall temperature is lower, the spots must be emitting less, which makes sense as dark spots are cooler regions.

Now, the part about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium). The equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2 (level 1 to level 2) or maybe n2/n1? Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So without spots, ratio is higher. Let me think: if the temperature is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease because exp
