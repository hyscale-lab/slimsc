Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I remember that the reaction conditions usually involve nitrous acid, which is formed from HCl and NaNO2. So, what kind of reactions produce diketones from such conditions?

Wait, I think this is about the Stephen reduction or maybe some kind of oxidation or elimination. Oh wait, wait, no, Stephen reduction is for converting ketones to alkanes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe these are cases of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think that's it because Baeyer-Villiger involves ketones and introduces an oxygen, forming a lactone or something. Or perhaps it's about the formation of diketones via some kind of cleavage.

Wait a second, another possibility: the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is often used for the hydrolysis of nitro compounds, but more importantly, I think this is related to the nitrous acid-induced cleavage of alkenes. Oh! Right, the Hock rearrangement? Or maybe the production of a carbonyl group via elimination.

Alternatively, wait, nitrous acid is used in the production of nitroso compounds, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait! Maybe it's about the oxidation of alcohols to ketones. I remember that secondary alcohols can be oxidized to ketones using strong oxidizing agents. But what about the specific reagents here?

Wait, when an aldehyde or ketone is treated with HCl and NaNO2, it might form a diazonium salt. But wait, that's more for aromatic amines, right? Diazonium salts from amines, then maybe coupling reactions. That doesn't seem to fit here.

Alternatively, I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: in the presence of HCl and NaNO2, primary alcohols can form nitrous acid, which can lead to the formation of nitro compounds or other transformations. Wait, primary alcohols under certain conditions (like HCl and heat) can form chlorides, but with nitrous acid, perhaps it's more about the formation of ket
