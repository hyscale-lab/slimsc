Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, right. So the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1 and n2 is the number in level 2. They say this ratio decreases when spots are present. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present. We need to find the factor, which would be (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but why would the ratio change? Oh, because the temperature affects the populations of these energy levels. The transition is at 1448 Å, which I think is in the ultraviolet or near UV range, but I'm not entirely sure. But regardless, the key here is that the ratio depends on the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights or degeneracies of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is related to the wavelength of the transition. Using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So let me jot down the variables:

- T1 = 6000 K (no spots)
- T2 = 5500 K (with spots)
- λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m)
- The ratio R = (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.

Since the problem states that the ratio R decreases when the star has spots, that implies (n1/n2)_T2 < (n1/n2)_T1, so R is greater than 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio (n1/n2) when there are spots is lower than when there are no spots. So (n1/n2)_T2 < (n1/n2)_T1. So R = (n1/n2 at T1) / (n1/n2 at T2) = [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Ah, the g1/g2 terms cancel out. So R = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ). Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/k * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ). Because (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) is positive (since T2 < T1), and ΔE is positive, so the exponent is positive. So R is greater than 1. Which aligns with the fact that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So now I need to compute this factor R.

First, let's compute ΔE. Since E = hc/λ, but since we're dealing with the difference E2 - E1, which is the energy of the transition, I can compute ΔE = hc/(λ).

Let me plug in the numbers.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, I think I can also compute this in terms of eV for easier handling because sometimes k is expressed in eV/K. Let me see. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So:

ΔE (eV) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but 1448 Å is in the UV range, so the photon energy would be higher than visible light, which is longer wavelength. So 8.57 eV seems plausible since, for example, 1000 Å is 12.4 eV (since E = 12400 eV·Å / λ, so 1000 gives 12.4 eV).

Wait, another way: 12400 eV·Å / λ(Å) gives E in eV. So for λ=1448 Å,

E = 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.56 eV. Yep, that matches. So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

Now, Boltzmann's constant k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So now, let's compute (ΔE) / (k*T) for each temperature.

For T1=6000 K,

(ΔE)/(k*T1
