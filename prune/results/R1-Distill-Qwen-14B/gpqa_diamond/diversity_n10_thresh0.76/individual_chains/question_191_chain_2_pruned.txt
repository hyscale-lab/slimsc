Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so that's -CH2OH attached to C3). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. But prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually CH2-C(CH2-), no, wait. Let me clarify.

Prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=C-CH2- but attached at the second carbon. So, the substituent is CH2-C=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, when you have a substituent like prop-1-en-2-yl, it's CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, wait. The substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- but the substituent is attached at the second carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So, structure is CH2=CH-CH2- as a substituent attached at the central carbon. Wait, no, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. So attached at the second carbon. So the substituent
