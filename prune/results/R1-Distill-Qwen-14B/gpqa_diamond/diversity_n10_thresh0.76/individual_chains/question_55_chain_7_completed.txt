Okay, so I've got an NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

Let me start by recalling what the structures of these compounds look like. All of them are esters, right? So the general structure is an acetyl group (OAc) connected to an alkene chain. The difference between propenyl and butenyl is the length of the chain. Propenyl has three carbons, butenyl four. Also, the cis and trans refer to the configuration of the substituents on the double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

First, let's break down the signals. 

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably the acetyl group's methyl. Because in acetates, the OAc group is CH3COO-, so that methyl is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) must be a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, like CH2 or CH groups next to double bonds, splitting can occur. Since it's a doublet, that suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (dq) is interesting. That’s in the range of vinyl protons. A doublet of quadruplets suggests that this proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Wait, or maybe it's a more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet and a quartet merging into a more complex multiplet, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the proton is coupling with two different protons, each with a different J value, leading to a more complex splitting.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (J=16 Hz) is a higher field shift, but for a vinyl proton, maybe a substituent is causing that. Wait, 16 Hz is a large coupling constant, so that's probably between two vinyl protons, like in a trans configuration because trans coupling constants are usually higher than cis. Because in cis, the coupling J is around 10-12 Hz, and trans can be higher, like 15-18 Hz.

Wait, so the doublet at 7.0 ppm must be a vinyl proton that's coupled to another. Because the integration is 1H, that suggests a substituent on a double bond where only one proton is present on each carbon. Hmm, maybe it's a trans substituted double bond.

But let me think about the structure. Let's consider propenyl acetates first. For propenyl, the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-OAc or similar. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2- as the substituent. Acetate would be OAc-O-.

Wait, no, the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the alcohol and the acid. So if it's propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. Alternatively, if it's trans or cis, the substituents on either end of the double bond would be in different configurations.

Wait, but the options are butenyl and propenyl. So let's think about each.

First, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling. So in a vinyl group, when two protons are trans, their J is higher. So for example, in a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so their coupling is larger.

So, if this 7.0 ppm peak is a trans coupled proton, then the structure must have a trans double bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the coupling in different structures.

Consider trans-propenyl acetate. The structure would be CH2=CH-OAc, but wait, no, wait, propenyl is three carbons, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is propenyl. So the R is CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. But wait, in that case, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of the propenyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the acetate is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the protons on the double bond would be the CH2 and CH parts. Wait, no, the double bond is CH2-CH2. No, wait, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me structure it correctly. The propenyl group as an ester would be:

O
||
O-C-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

So R is CH2CH=CH2. So the structure is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2.

Wait, but wait. The propenyl group can be either CH2=CHCH2- (cis or trans? For propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents are CH2 and CH2 groups on either end. Hmm, but in that case, the structure would have the double bond in the middle, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but how would that look in terms of coupling?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that doesn't make sense because that would be a two-carbon group, which is ethenyl, not propenyl. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH=CH2? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the OAc is attached to the CH2.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures for the options given.

Options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond in the butenyl chain, but more accurately, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in the cis configuration. Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. So butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2CH2CH=CH2, but the exact structure depends on where the double bond is. Wait, but butenyl could be 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, etc. Hmm, but in the context of the options, I think the position is such that the OAc is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl group, which would make the structure CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. Or maybe it's CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, depending on the cis or trans.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each option and their possible NMR spectra.

Let me think about each option's structure.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure: CH2=CH-OAc. Wait, no, propenyl is three carbons. So the structure would be CH2CH=CH-OAc, but maybe more accurately, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is attached to C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. That's a possible structure for propenyl acetate. In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the propenyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me sketch the structures for each option.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but that would be 3-butenyl. Alternatively, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc in the cis configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C4.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Structure: OAc-O-CH2CH=CH2, but in trans configuration. Wait, but propenyl is three carbons, so the double bond would be between C1 and C2, and the OAc is on C3. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, would that be possible? Because for propenyl, the substituents on the double bond would be CH3 (from the OAc) and CH2-OAc.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structures. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet (1H) with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so it's likely a trans coupling between two vinyl protons.

Another signal at 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quadruplets. That might be a vinyl proton that's coupled to two different protons.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Like CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so it's coupling with one neighboring proton. So if it's a CH2 group next to a double bond, perhaps like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure has a CH2 group attached to a double bond. For example, in trans-propenyl acetate, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's ethenyl. Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the structure is (Z)-CH2CH=CH-OAc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the splitting patterns. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a bit tricky. A doublet of quadruplets suggests that the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, maybe it's coupling with two different protons, each with a different J value, leading to a quartet splitting into a doublet, making a dq.

Wait, but another possibility is that the proton is adjacent to two different types of protons. For example, if it's a CH group next to a double bond, and it's coupled with two different protons from each adjacent CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5ppm is a coupling with two different protons, each with a different J value.

Wait, let me imagine a structure for cis-propenyl acetate. If the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. So the OAc is attached to CH2, which is attached to a double bond (CH=CH2).

In that case, the double bond is between the two CH groups. Let's consider the protons on the double bond.

In such a structure, the double bond would have two CH groups. The structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, acetate is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl.

Wait, maybe it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3.

In that case, the CH2 is attached to the OAc, then a CH=CH2 group.

The protons on the double bond would be on C2 and C3. So, the C2 would be CH, and C3 would be CH2.

Wait, but in that case, the CH on C2 would have a proton that's coupled with the CH2 on C3.

Wait, but let's think about the possible splitting. The C2 proton is a CH, and it's coupled with the adjacent protons on C3.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, then the structure would be CH2-OAc-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's butyl. Wait, no, for propenyl, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So the protons on C2 and C3 would be the ones on the double bond.

So, the CH2 (C1) is attached to OAc, then C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The propenyl group is CH2-CH=CH2, so as an ester, it would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between the second and third carbons of the propenyl group.

Therefore, the protons on C2 and C3 are the ones on the double bond.

So the C2 would have a CH group, and C3 would have a CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me think: the propenyl group is CH2-CH=CH2. So when the OAc is attached to the first carbon, the structure becomes OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the C2 has a CH group, and C3 has a CH2 group.

Wait, but the CH2 group would have two protons. So in the NMR, the protons on C2 would be the ones that might show up as a doublet or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet (J=16Hz), which suggests a trans coupling. So perhaps the double bond is trans, so the substituents on either end are on opposite sides.

In that case, the protons on the double bond would be trans, leading to a coupling of J=16 Hz.

So, for the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the C2 and C3 are the double bond carbons. The C2 would have a proton (CH group), and the C3 would have two protons (CH2 group). Wait, but the C3 would be a CH2, so it's not a vinyl proton. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's butenyl, not propenyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structures wrong. Let me think about the options again.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, cis and trans.

So for propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, with the double bond between C2 and C3 of the propenyl chain.

So the C2 has a CH group (one proton), and the C3 has a CH2 group (two protons).

Wait, but in that case, the C3's protons are not attached to the double bond, so their chemical shift would be different.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the peaks are at 7.0, 5.5, 2.1, and 1.6.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which is probably a vinyl proton. So the C2's proton would be in that region.

The 5.5 ppm is a more complex splitting, perhaps from the C3's protons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm doublet is 3H. That's a methyl group. So where is that?

Ah, wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Because in that case, the C next to the double bond would have a methyl group.

Wait, no, because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's not a propenyl group, that's a substituted propenyl.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a CH(CH3) group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the integration. The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, which suggests only one proton there. So perhaps that's the trans proton, and the other protons on the double bond are maybe more downfield or in a different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl). So the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, the protons on C3 would be a CH2 group, and on C4, another CH2 group. Wait, but that doesn't explain the 7.0 peak.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR signals again.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) is a vinyl proton. Its coupling with another proton (J=16) suggests that it's a trans coupling. So the structure must have a trans double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be another vinyl proton, which is coupled with two different protons. For example, if it's a CH group between two CH2 groups, each with different J values.

Wait, another possibility: the structure has a geminal substituent, but that's probably not the case here.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group. Since it's a doublet, it's coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps it's attached to a CH group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. In that case, the C(CH3) is in the middle of the chain. Wait, but that would be a isopropenyl group. So maybe the structure is OAc-O-C(CH3)=CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group adjacent to a double bond.

So, the structure could be OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but no, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the C3 has a CH2 group, and C4 has a CH2 group with a methyl substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to match the NMR peaks to the possible structures.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) is a trans coupling, so the two protons on the double bond are trans.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be a proton that's coupled with two different protons from adjacent carbons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to a double bond.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of the structure as OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, making it a butenyl group. Let me see: the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the C4 is a methyl group.

So the protons on C2 and C3 would be the vinyl protons.

The C2 would have a CH2 group attached to OAc, and the C3 would have a CH group attached to CH3.

Wait, the C3 would have a CH group attached to CH3, so its structure would be CH2-OAc-CH2-CH=CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C3 has a CH2 group with a methyl substituent.

Wait, in that case, the protons on C2 would be CH2, so their chemical shift would be around 5.5 ppm, perhaps as a quartet or doublet of quartets.

But the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16.0 Hz, which is a larger coupling, so perhaps that's from a trans coupling between two protons on the double bond.

Wait, but in OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C2 has a CH2 group (protons on CH2), and C3 has a CH group (with a methyl substituent).

Wait, but that would mean the C3 has only one proton, so that's the one that would appear as a doublet at 7.0 ppm, coupled with the C2 protons.

Wait, but the C2 would have two protons on a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. So their chemical shift would be around 5.5 ppm, maybe as a quartet due to coupling with the C3 proton.

Hmm, maybe that's the case.

So the C3 proton would be a CH group attached to a methyl group. Its chemical shift would be around 7.0 ppm, as a doublet with J=16 Hz, coupled with the C2 protons.

Wait, but the C2 protons are on a CH2 next to the double bond, so they would be a quartet because each proton is coupling with the C3 proton (which is one, so each C2 H would be a doublet of the others, but perhaps as a quartet due to two protons coupling? Wait, no. If the C2 has two protons, each coupling with the C3 proton, then the C2 protons would be a doublet of doublets, but perhaps they're integrated into a quartet. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is more complex.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quadruplets (dq). So perhaps that's the C2 protons, which are coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and maybe another set of protons elsewhere, perhaps from the adjacent methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to outline the possible structure and its NMR.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2:

- The OAc methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s, 3H).

- The C2 (CH2) protons are adjacent to the double bond. Their chemical shift would be around 5.5 ppm. Since they're on a CH2 group, each proton would be coupled with the neighboring C3 proton (which is a CH group), leading to a doublet of doublets or perhaps a quartet. But the NMR shows a doublet of quadruplets, which is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the C2 protons are coupled with two different protons: the C3 proton (J=16 Hz, leading to a doublet) and another proton from a different position, perhaps the adjacent CH(CH3) group?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the coupling in the structure.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, I think I remember that in the NMR of an ester, the acetate methyl (OAc) is a singlet around 2.1 ppm, which matches the data.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH, which is next to a double bond. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group attached to the double bond.

So, the structure would have a CH(CH3) group adjacent to the double bond.

So, for example, the structure could be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C2 is CH2, and C3 is C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, but in that structure, the C3 would have a CH2 group attached to a methyl, making it a CH(CH3) group.

So the C3 would have a CH2 group, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and C4 is a methyl group.

In this case, the C2 would be CH2, and C3 would be CH, with a methyl group on C4.

So, the C2 protons would be adjacent to the double bond. Their chemical shift would be around 5.5 ppm, perhaps as a quartet due to coupling with the C3 proton.

The C3 proton is a CH group attached to the double bond and a methyl group. Its chemical shift would be around 7.0 ppm, as a doublet due to coupling with the C2 protons (J=16 Hz).

Ah, that makes sense. So the C3 proton is the one at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz), and the C2 protons are at 5.5 ppm (dq), which is a doublet of quadruplets because they're coupling with the C3 proton and perhaps another set of protons.

Wait, but the C2 is a CH2 group. Each proton on C2 would be coupled with the adjacent C3 proton (J=16 Hz), and perhaps also with any other protons attached to the same carbon. Wait, no, each proton on C2 is on the same CH2, so they would be split by the C3 proton.

But the C2 protons would be a quartet because each is split by two neighboring protons (the two on C3?), but wait, C3 is a CH group, so only one proton.

Wait, no, if the C2 is CH2 and the C3 is CH, then each C2 proton would be coupled with the C3 proton, leading to a doublet for each. But since the two C2 protons are equivalent, their signals would combine.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the C2 protons would be a quartet if each is coupled with two protons on another carbon, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets due to coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, each C2 proton is coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and with a neighboring CH2 group's protons (J=something else, say 8 Hz), leading to a quartet in addition to the doublet.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is the C2 protons, which are a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond, and thus their splitting is more complex.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, 3H, so it's a methyl group coupled with one proton. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group adjacent to a double bond.

Putting all this together, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

In this structure:

- The OAc methyl is at 2.1 ppm (s, 3H).

- The C2 is CH2, adjacent to the double bond. The protons on C2 would be around 5.5 ppm, as a quartet (coupled with the C3 proton).

- The C3 is CH, attached to a methyl group (CH3). Its proton would be at 7.0 ppm, as a doublet (coupled with the C2 protons, J=16 Hz).

- The C4 is a methyl group, attached to the double bond. Its protons would be at 1.6 ppm (d, 3H), coupled with the C3 proton (J=something, perhaps 8 Hz).

Wait, but in that case, the C4 is a methyl group attached to the double bond. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.

Now, considering the configuration (cis or trans), the double bond's substituents would determine the coupling constant.

If the substituents on either end of the double bond are trans, the coupling J would be larger (like 16 Hz). So in this structure, if the substituents on C2 and C4 are on opposite sides, it would be trans.

Wait, but in this structure, C2 is CH2-OAc, C3 is CH-CH3, and C4 is CH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So the substituents on C2 are OAc and H, and on C3 are CH2-OAc and CH3.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of the structure as OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, because that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the C3 has a CH3 group attached.

In this case, the C2 is CH2, the C3 is C(CH3)=CH2, but wait, that would imply a double bond from C2 to C3, and C3 has a methyl group.

So the C3 would have a CH group attached to a methyl, making it C(CH3)=CH2.

In that case, the C3's proton would be at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16), and the C2's protons would be at 5.5 ppm (dq).

The methyl group on C3 would be at 1.6 ppm (d), since it's attached to the C3 proton.

So, putting it all together, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Now, considering the configuration (cis or trans), the substituents on the double bond (C2 and C3) would determine the coupling constant. If the substituents are trans, the J would be 16 Hz.

So, the peak at 7.0 ppm is the C3 proton, coupled with the C2 protons (J=16), which are at 5.5 ppm.

The C2 protons (CH2) would each be coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz), making them a quartet? Or perhaps a doublet of doublets.

Wait, but the NMR shows the 5.5 ppm as a dq, which is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, perhaps that's due to coupling with another proton elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the C2 protons are coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and with the adjacent methyl group's protons.

Wait, but the methyl group is on C3, so the C2's protons are adjacent to the C3's CH group, which has a methyl. So the C2's protons would be coupled with the C3's proton (J=16) and perhaps with any other protons nearby, like the methyl's protons. But methyl protons are usually not coupled because they're equivalent and split the signal into a septet, but in this case, perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets because each C2 proton is coupled with the C3 proton (J=16 Hz) and with another proton from a different position.

I'm not entirely confident, but based on the coupling constants and the splitting patterns, I think the structure with a trans double bond, leading to a J=16 Hz, would be the correct option.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer would be either the cis or trans of propenyl or butenyl.

Given the chemical shifts and splitting, I think the structure is trans-butenyl acetate or trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

In the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which suggests a trans configuration. So the compound must be either trans-propenyl or trans-butenyl acetate.

Now, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH group (since it's a doublet). So it's likely a CH(CH3) group adjacent to a double bond.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 (trans), the methyl is on the C3, which is adjacent to the double bond, and the C3's proton is at 7.0 ppm.

So, the correct option would be trans-butenyl acetate (D) if the double bond is in the butenyl chain, or trans-propenyl acetate (B) if the double bond is in the propenyl chain.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm methyl could be on a propenyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is trans-propenyl acetate, which would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 in the trans configuration. But in this case, the double bond would be between C2 and C3, with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but then the C3 would be a CH2 group, so the C3's protons would be on CH2, which would be split into a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

In the end, the key points are:

- The J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling between two vinyl protons.

- The presence of a methyl group attached to a CH group adjacent to the double bond (1.6 ppm, d, 3H).

- The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets would be the CH2 protons adjacent to the double bond, coupled with both the CH group's proton and perhaps another set.

Given all this, I think the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, it could be trans-propenyl acetate (option B), but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, let me consider the integration of the peaks. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, which would be a single proton. So in the structure, there's only one proton on that carbon. That would mean it's a CH group, not a CH2.

So, the structure would have a CH group with a methyl substituent attached next to the double bond.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's not with a double bond. Alternatively, OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the C3 is C(CH3)=CH2, so the C3 has a CH2 group with a methyl substituent.

Wait, no. If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C3 is C(CH3)=CH2, which would mean it's a CH group with a methyl substituent.

So the C3 would have one proton (CH group), which is at 7.0 ppm as a doublet (coupled with C2's protons, J=16 Hz).

The C2's protons are on a CH2 group, which would be at around 5.5 ppm as a quartet (coupled with the C3's proton, J=16 Hz, and perhaps another coupling, leading to the dq).

The methyl group is on C3, so its protons are at 1.6 ppm as a doublet (coupled with the C3's proton, J=8 Hz or so).

So, putting this together, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would be trans if the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides.

But wait, the options are between propenyl and butenyl. The structure OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 is a four-carbon chain (OAc is 3 carbons, but wait: OAc is CH3COO-.

Wait, OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 would be a four-carbon chain: OAc-O- (CH2-C(CH3)=CH2). So that's three carbons in the ester group, making it a propenyl group? Or butenyl?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the chain length wrong. Let me count: OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that's without the double bond.

Alternatively, the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 would be a four-carbon chain (OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3), which would be butenyl.

In that case, the structure would have a butenyl group (four carbons) with a double bond. So that would be option D (Trans-butenyl acetate) or option A (Cis-butenyl acetate).

Given the J=16 Hz, it's trans, so the correct option would be D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

But wait, the 1.6 ppm peak is a methyl group. In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, the CH3 is on C4, which is adjacent to the double bond. Therefore, the C4's methyl (CH3) would be attached to the CH group on C3.

So the C4's CH3 would be next to the double bond, and their protons would be a doublet (coupled with the C3's proton, J=8 Hz or so).

So, the chemical shift for the methyl group would be around 1.6 ppm, which matches the data.

The C3's proton would be at 7.0 ppm as a doublet (coupled with the C2's protons, J=16 Hz), and the C2's protons would be at 5.5 ppm as a quartet (coupled with the C3's proton, J=16 Hz), which would explain the dq.

So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, with the double bond trans.

Therefore, the correct option is D: Trans-butenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The key NMR data provided are:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), indicating a trans coupling between two vinyl protons.
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: A doublet of quadruplets, suggesting a vinyl proton coupled with two different sets of protons.
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet for the methyl group in the acetate (OAc) moiety.
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet for a methyl group adjacent to a double bond, likely part of a CH(CH3) group.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (A)**: In a cis configuration, the coupling constant (J) between vinyl protons is typically smaller (around 10–12 Hz). However, the NMR data shows a J = 16 Hz, which is characteristic of a trans configuration. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)**: The structure of trans-propenyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH=CH2 with the double bond in the propenyl chain. The double bond would result in two vinyl protons. However, the NMR data includes a peak at 1.6 ppm (3H, d), which corresponds to a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. This suggests the presence of a CH(CH3) group, which is not consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate. Therefore, this option is also unlikely.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (C)**: Similar to trans-propenyl acetate, cis-propenyl acetate has a double bond in the propenyl chain. Like trans-propenyl acetate, it lacks the CH(CH3) group required to explain the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) peak. Additionally, the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) indicates a trans configuration, ruling out the cis isomer. Thus, this option is not consistent with the data.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)**: The structure of trans-butenyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH=CHCH3 with the double bond in the butenyl chain. The trans configuration explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) for the vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm. The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) peak corresponds to the vinyl proton on the adjacent carbon, which is coupled with two different protons. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) peak matches the methyl group on the terminal carbon of the butenyl chain, which is adjacent to the double bond. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data, including the coupling constants and splitting patterns, matches the structure of **Trans-butenyl acetate**.
