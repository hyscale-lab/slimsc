Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with sigma bonds, and they're pericyclic reactions, which usually means they involve concerted mechanisms, right? The question provides three different reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the options given.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... That's like a molecule where ethanamine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So it's (HOCH2CH2)2NH, but wait no, wait. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be H2N-C(OCH3)2. So the amine is on carbon 1, and carbons 1 and 2 have the methoxy groups? Wait, no, I think ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the amine nitrogen? No, wait, that can't be, because ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the first carbon. Wait, wait wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the amine is on carbon 1, and carbon 1 has two methoxy substituents. So it's a geminal di-substituted amine.

But then, when reacting with but-3-en-2-ol (which is CH2CHCH(OH)CH3?), wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure: It's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOHCH3? No,
