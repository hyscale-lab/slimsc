Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question about a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

So, the question describes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. That means these three groups are each separated by one carbon (since meta is 1,3 positions). Wait, no, meta in benzene rings refers to positions that are two carbons apart, not one. So for a benzene ring numbered 1 to 6, if one substituent is at position 1, the meta would be 3 and 5? No, wait. Oh, wait, no. For benzene, the meta positions are two apart. So if I have a substituent at position 1, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. But the question says all three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to each other. So that suggests each is at a meta position relative to the others, which might form a sort of triangle around the ring.

Wait, maybe it's that each substituent is meta to the others. So the arrangement would be such that each substituent is meta to the other two. Hmm, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so maybe they're at positions 1, 3, and 5. Because 1 is meta to 3 (since 3-1=2), and 3 is meta to 5 (5-3=2), and 5 is meta to 1 (since 1-5 is like adding 6-5=1, but wait, no, the positions wrap around. So the meta positions for 5 would be 1 and 3? Wait, the meta position for a substituent at position 5 would be 2 and 4? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering.

Let me think again. On a benzene ring, each position has two ortho (adjacent), two meta (two away), and one para (opposite). So for position 1: ortho are 2 and 6; meta are 3 and 5; para is 4. So, if three substituents are all meta to each other, where would they be? Let's suppose the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) should be at positions 3 and 5. Because position 1's meta is 3 and 5.

So, the three substituents (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are at 1, 3, and 5. So that's one part.

Now, the question also states: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Its ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, positions 2 and 6 have a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) group. But wait, which is which? The
