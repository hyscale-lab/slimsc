Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the atom) with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The energy associated with this is called the Zeeman effect. The term would be something like the magnetic dipole moment interacting with the magnetic field. 

The paramagnetic coupling term H (Hamiltonian) is usually given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. But wait, for electrons, the magnetic moment μ is proportional to the orbital angular momentum L, right? And μ is given by μ = (e/(2m)) * L, or something like that, but maybe I should think in terms of quantum numbers.

Wait, the problem states that m is small. Oh, the orbital magnetic quantum number m, which is the z-component of the angular momentum. So m is small in magnitude, like m=0, ±1, etc. But for hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be up to a certain value, but here m is small, so maybe it's not so relevant for the magnitude of the energy term.

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. I think 1 Tesla is a pretty strong field, but for paramagnetic materials, maybe not super strong. But I'm not sure about the typical scales.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given via the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let's compute that. The given λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Hmm, that sounds familiar—it's the Balmer series for hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2, and emits a photon of wavelength about 656 nm. Wait, no, wait, wait—actually, wait. Wait, no, the Balmer-alpha is ~656 nm. 486 nm is H-beta, from n=4 to n=2. Let me compute the energy.

Using hc = 1240 eV·nm. So
