Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, particles and antiparticles annihilating each other. Right, when particles annihilate, they usually produce other particles. In this case, it's creating two A+ and two A- particles. So, since it's an annihilation process, energy and momentum must be conserved.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Oh, but wait, if it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its energy as just its rest mass energy? Because when something is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is not too high, so the total energy might be dominated by rest mass.

But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the proton is at rest? Or is the antiproton moving, but slowly? The question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some low velocity. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is much lower than the speed of light, so v ≈ 0. But I'm a bit confused about the setup.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. But since it's an annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be considered.

But perhaps since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can treat the system as being approximately at rest in terms of energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe only the rest masses are considered, since the kinetic energy is negligible.

Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², I think. But the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². So each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass after the reaction is 4*300 = 1200 MeV. The initial system is a proton and antiproton, each of rest mass
