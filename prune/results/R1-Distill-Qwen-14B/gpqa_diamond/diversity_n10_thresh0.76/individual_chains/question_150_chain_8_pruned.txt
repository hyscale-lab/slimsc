Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several signals. Let me list them out:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each of these signals and what they could represent.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe it's an aldehyde proton (CHO), but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are typically singlets or maybe doublets if coupled with something. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton that's deshielded, perhaps as part of an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. Oh, wait, but another possibility is an acidic proton, like an -OH in a phenol. But phenolic OHs usually appear around 5 ppm, unless they're exchanging, which sometimes broadens them. Wait, but in the NMR given, the 9.72 is a triplet, so maybe not an OH. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, an aldehyde group.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72â€”maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde. Or perhaps it's a formyl group attached to something. Let me think about the other signals.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those might be two sets of aromatic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene ring, the protons are split into two doublets. So maybe there are two benzene rings here. Each ring would have two protons as doublets.

Then there's the 6.27 ppm signal, a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet suggests something like an -OH (phenol or alcohol), but since it's a singlet, maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons. Or perhaps it's vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's in the range for, say, methylene groups attached to something electron-withdrawing, like an oxygen. So maybe -OCH2- or something like that. Or perhaps it's part of an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: 2*8=16 +2=18. 18 -9 (H)=9. Subtract X (if any, here X is 0). Add N (1). So 9 +1=10. 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of uns
