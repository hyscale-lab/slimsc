Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The options are about how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation generally occurs via an electrophilic addition mechanism, forming an epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific. If the alkene is in a certain configuration, the epoxide forms with specific stereochemistry.

So, for each alkene (E and Z), when they react with mCPBA, what happens?

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Then aqueous acid.

Wait, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening, I think, but noâ€”epoxidation is a [2+2] addition of the peracid to the alkene, forming an epoxide. Oh wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a concerted way, leading to an epoxide with certain stereochemistry.

Wait, actually, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it does an epoxidation, which is an electrocyclic reaction, I think. But wait, for dienes, but in this case it's a simple alkene.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereoselectivity. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes to form epoxides is a stereospecific process. The peracid adds to the less substituted side or something? Or does it form the epoxide with a certain configuration based on the starting alkene's geometry?

Wait, I'm getting a bit fuzzy here. Let me try to remember. Epoxidation with mCPBA proceeds through a cyclic transition state. The peracid's oxygen
