Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a potential, the particle experiences a force similar to Hooke's law, which makes sense because the potential energy is quadratic in r.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels of a 3D harmonic oscillator. I remember that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Since the potential is isotropic, the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for each direction. But wait, sometimes it's more convenient to use a total quantum number n such that n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E can also be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

But wait, I think I might be mixing something up. Let me think again. Oh right, in 3D, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states share the same energy. The degeneracy depends on the value of n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. Each energy level is (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). 

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. I need to clarify what the ground state is. The ground state is the state with the lowest energy. So let me think: in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the ground state corresponds to n=0 because each of n_x, n_y, n_z is zero. The first excited state would be the next possible energy level, which is when n=1. Then the second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3.

Wait, no, wait a second. Sometimes people count the excited states starting from the ground state as the first state. So ground state is the zeroth excited state? Or perhaps the first excited state is the first level above ground. Let me clarify.

In standard terminology, the ground state is the lowest energy state (n=0). Then the first excited state is n=1, second excited state n=2, third excited state n=3. So yes, the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's (9/2) ħω, which matches some of the options.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue.
