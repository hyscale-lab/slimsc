Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves along with a pi bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this. Sigmatropic rearrangements can occur through either a [3,3] sigmatropic shift, like in the Cope rearrangement, or a [4,4] shift, but more commonly [3,3] I think.

The problem has three separate reactions, each leading to a product A, B, or C. The options give possible structures for each, and I need to match the correct products to the options A, B, C provided.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine structure is like HN(CH2OCH3)2. But wait, no, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be where the amine is on carbon 1, and carbons 1 and 2 each have a methoxy group? Or wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is NH(CH2OCH3)2? Or maybe it's (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (HOCH2CH2NH2) but with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. Wait, perhaps it's [(CH3O)2CH]NH2? Wait, no. Let me think: ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2 (but that's ethylamine), but wait, ethan-1-amine is H2NCH2CH3. So 1,1-dimeth
