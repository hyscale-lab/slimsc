Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I'm supposed to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum must be conserved. Since both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the collision is head-on, so the setup is along one dimension, but the photons are emitted in different directions, probably at some angle above and below the horizontal.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right? Or could they be moving in the same direction but different vertical angles? But the initial particles were moving along the x-axis, so the photons could be emitted in any direction, but in this case, symmetrically above and below the x-axis direction, perhaps? Or maybe opposite directions?

Wait, the electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). So their initial velocities are opposite. Let me think about their momenta.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. The electron has gamma_e =4, the positron gamma_p=2. But wait, positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so its mass is same as electron, but charge opposite. So, for the electron, moving left to right, its velocity is in +x direction. The positron is moving right to left, so its velocity is in -x direction.

So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_p v_p. Wait, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, p_p would be negative. So let me denote the electron's momentum as positive, and positron's as negative.

Wait, but when they collide, their total momentum must be considered. Because in the collision, the total momentum before must equal the total after. So let's compute the initial momentum.

But wait, the electron is moving left to right (so momentum in +x) and the positron is moving right to left (so momentum in -x). Let me get the speeds. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So for the electron, gamma_e is 4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p is 2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c.

Wait, but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so v_p = -0.866 c. So the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Wait, wait, that's not quite right. Let me redo that. The momentum p = gamma * m * v. So for the electron: gamma_e=4, so p_e = 4 * m_e * v_e.

Similarly, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4) c, so p_e =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e * sqrt(15) c. So that's p_e = sqrt(15) * m_e c.

For the positron, gamma_p=2, v_p is (sqrt(3)/2) c, but since it's moving to the left, v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

So p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But m_p is same as m_e because positron is just electron's antimatter. So p_p = 2 * m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So 3.872 -1.732 is about 2.14. So p_initial is about 2.14 m_e c.

Hmm. Wait, but maybe I should keep it symbolic for now.

Now, after the collision, the system produces two photons. Each photon has energy E1 and E2, but the problem states that their energies are the same. So E1 = E2.

Photons have energy E = pc, since for photons, m=0, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ) = pc if m=0.

So each photon has energy equal to p c, so p = E/(c).

Now, the photons are moving in directions upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are vectors in the plane. Let me represent the momenta of the photons as vectors. Since the photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are same: p1 = p2 = p.

I need to find the angle between their directions. But I also have to consider conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, but the initial momentum was along the x-axis. The photons are emitted in the upper-right (let's say, first quadrant) and lower-right (fourth quadrant) directions. So their momenta will have both x and y components.

Wait, but wait. The initial momentum is along the x-axis. So the total momentum after annihilation must also be along the x-axis, because the initial system's momentum is only in x. So the sum of the two photon momenta must be along the x-axis.

Let me model the photon momenta. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1 has momentum vector p1 with components (px1, py1), and photon 2 has (px2, py2).

But because they have same energy, their magnitudes are same: |p1|=|p2|=p.

Conservation of momentum:

Total initial momentum is (p_initial, 0) along x-axis.

After collision, the total momentum is (px1 + px2, py1 + py2) = (p_initial, 0).

So:

px1 + px2 = p_initial
py1 + py2 = 0

So the y-components must cancel each other.

Additionally, conservation of energy: total energy before must equal total after.

Energy before: The total energy is the sum of energies of electron and positron.

E_electron = gamma_e * m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2.

E_positron = gamma_p * m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.

So total energy before collision is 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

After collision, the total energy is E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 E_photon, since E1=E2.

Wait, no. Because each photon's energy is E = p c, and since E1=E2, each photon has energy p c, so total energy is 2 p c.

Wait, but wait. Because the photons are moving in different directions, their energies are same, but their momenta are vectors. So E1 = |p1| c, E2= |p2| c.

But we were told E1=E2, so |p1|=|p2|=p.

So total energy after is 2 p c.

Wait, but before collision, the total energy was 6 m_e c^2 = 2 p c.

So 6 m_e c^2 = 2 p c → p = 3 m_e c.

So each photon has momentum of magnitude 3 m_e c.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute p_initial (the initial momentum) again. Earlier, p_initial was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, no, let me recheck.

p_initial = p_e + p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e.

v_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) c.

gamma_e =4, so 1/gamma_e² =1/16.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.

So p_e = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) c = sqrt(3/4) c = (sqrt(3)/2) c.

But the positron is moving in the opposite direction, so p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p * direction. Since it's moving to the left, the direction is negative, so p_p = 2 m_e * (- sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Thus, p_initial = p_e + p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm. Ok.

So we have the initial momentum along x-axis.

Now, the photons.

Each photon's momentum is a vector with magnitude p = 3 m_e c (since 2 p c = 6 m_e c², so p=3 m_e c).

Photon 1 has momentum (px1, py1), photon 2 has (px2, py2).

From conservation of momentum:

px1 + px2 = p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

And:

py1 + py2 = 0 → py2 = - py1.

Also, the magnitudes of the photons' momenta are same: sqrt(px1² + py1²) = sqrt(px2² + py2²) = 3 m_e c.

But since py2 = -py1, let me call py1 = a, so py2 = -a.

So, each photon's momentum vector is (px1, a) and (px2, -a).

The magnitudes are:

sqrt(px1² + a²) = 3 m_e c,

sqrt(px2² + a²) = 3 m_e c.

So both px1 and px2 must satisfy px^2 + a^2 = (3 m_e c)^2.

So, px1² = (3 m_e c)^2 - a²,

px2² = same.

Hmm, but we also have px1 + px2 = p_initial.

Hmm, perhaps there's a way to relate these. Let me think.

Let me denote px1 = x, px2 = y. So x + y = p_initial.

Also, each has sqrt(x² + a²) = sqrt(y² + a²) = 3 m_e c.

Wait, but since a is same for both, perhaps x and y are symmetric in some way? Or perhaps they are equal? Well, if x = y, then their sum would be 2x = p_initial → x = p_initial / 2.

But wait, let me see: If x and y satisfy x² + a² = y² + a², then x² = y² → x = y or x = -y.

If x + y = p_initial, and x = y, then 2x = p_initial → x = p_initial/2.

So that would imply that x = y = p_initial/2.

Alternatively, if x = -y, then x + y =0, but p_initial is non-zero (since it's m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) which is positive), so this isn't the case.

So, the only possibility is that x = y, leading to 2x = p_initial → x = p_initial/2.

So, px1 = px2 = p_initial /2.

Hmm, but wait, let me confirm. If I assume x = y, then each has the same x-component. Then, the y-components are a and -a.

So, for each photon, px = p_initial / 2, and py = a and -a.

But then, the magnitude for each photon is sqrt( (p_initial/2)^2 + a² ) = 3 m_e c.

So, let's write that equation:

[ (p_initial/2)^2 + a^2 ] = (3 m_e c)^2.

We can solve for a.

But p_initial is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, (p_initial/2)^2 = [ m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) / 2 ]^2.

So, expanding that:

= (m_e c)^2 * [ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² ] /4.

Expand the square in the numerator:

(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))^2 = (15) +3 - 2 * sqrt(15)*sqrt(3) ) = 18 - 2 sqrt(45) = 18 - 2*3*sqrt(5) = 18 - 6 sqrt(5).

So, (p_initial/2)^2 = (m_e c)^2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) /4.

Then, the equation becomes:

(m_e c)^2 (18 -6 sqrt(5)) /4 + a² = (3 m_e c)^2.

Multiply both sides by (m_e c)^2:

(18 -6 sqrt(5))/4 + (a/(m_e c))^2 = 9.

Let me compute the left term:

(18 -6√5)/4 = [6(3 -√5)]/4 = [3(3 -√5)]/2 ≈ let's compute numerically:

3 ≈ 3, √5≈2.236, so 3 -√5≈0.764.

3*0.764≈2.292. Divided by 2 → ≈1.146.

So left term is approximately 1.146 (m_e c)^2.

So:

1.146 (m_e c)^2 + a² =9 (m_e c)^2 → a²= 9-1.146=7.854 (m_e c)^2.

So a= sqrt(7.854) m_e c ≈ 2.8 m_e c.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if this is necessary. Maybe there's another approach. Since the two photons have the same energy and their y-components are a and -a, the total y-momentum is zero, which is correct.

Now, the angle between the two photons would be determined by their direction vectors. Let me think about the directions.

Each photon has momentum components (p_initial/2, a) and (p_initial/2, -a). So they are symmetric about the x-axis. So the angle between them can be found by the angle each makes with the x-axis, and then doubling it or something.

Wait, but to find the angle between the two photons, perhaps I should compute the angle each makes with the x-axis, and then find the difference between those two angles.

Each photon's direction can be found by theta1 and theta2, where theta1 is the angle above x-axis, and theta2 is the angle below, but since they are symmetric, theta2 = -theta1.

But wait, the photons have the same magnitude in x and opposite in y. So the angle each makes with the x-axis is theta = arctan( a / (p_initial/2) ), and -theta.

Wait, no: arctan( (a)/(p_initial/2) ), so each photon has an angle of theta and -theta relative to the x-axis.

So the angle between them would be 2 theta.

So, theta = arctan( (2a) / p_initial )

Because a is the magnitude of the y-component, and (p_initial/2) is the x-component for each photon.

So, let's compute (2a)/(p_initial).

We have a ≈2.8 m_e c, and p_initial= m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So, 2a = 5.6 m_e c.

p_initial= m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, (2a)/(p_initial) = 5.6 / (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

But let me compute this symbolically. Let me write it as (2a)/(p_initial) = [2 * sqrt(7.854) m_e c ] / [ (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) m_e c ].

The m_e c terms cancel, so:

= 2 * sqrt(7.854) / (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Compute sqrt(7.854): sqrt(7.854) ≈ 2.8, as earlier.

So numerator: 2 * 2.8 ≈5.6.

Denominator: sqrt(15) ≈3.872, sqrt(3)=1.732 → 3.872 -1.732≈2.14.

So 5.6 / 2.14 ≈ 2.615.

So (2a)/(p_initial) ≈2.615.

Hmm, but arctangent of 2.615 is about 69 degrees, because tan(60)=√3≈1.732, tan(70)≈2.747. 2.615 is between 70 and 69.

Let me compute tan(theta) = 2.615 → theta ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 * theta ≈ 2*69=138 degrees.

Wait, but wait; that seems to match one of the options. Option C is 138, so that's a possible answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute (2a)/(p_initial) exactly.

Earlier steps:

We had a² = 9 (m_e c)^2 - (p_initial/2)^2.

We had a² = 9 - [ (p_initial/(2 m_e c) )^2 ].

Wait, let me compute (p_initial/(2 m_e c)).

p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So, (p_initial)/(2 m_e c) )= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/2.

Let me compute that numerically:

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.

3.87298 -1.73205 =2.14093.

Divide by 2: 1.070465.

So (p_initial/(2 m_e c)) =1.070465.

Thus, (p_initial/(2 m_e c))² = (1.070465)^2 ≈1.146.

So, a²=9 -1.146=7.854 → a= sqrt(7.854)≈2.802 m_e c.

So, 2a=5.604 m_e c.

So (2a)/(p_initial) = (5.604 m_e c ) / ( m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) ) )=5.604/(3.87298-1.73205)=5.604/2.14093 ≈2.617.

So, tan(theta)≈2.617.

What angle has a tan of ~2.617?

Let me think. Tan(69 degrees)= about 2.605, tan(69.5)= approx 2.65.

Wait, 69 degrees: tan(69) ≈ 2.605.

tan(69.5)=tan(69+0.5) → perhaps around 2.65.

But 2.617 is between 69 and 69.5. Let me compute using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the exact expressions.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using the exact values, the angle between the photons is 180 - 2 theta, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the two photons are symmetrically placed above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.

So, if theta is approximately 69 degrees, the angle between them is about 138 degrees, which is option C. That would make sense.

Wait, but another thought: the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the photons must carry away momentum along the x-axis. Since both have px = p_initial/2, their sum is p_initial.

So, each photon's x-component is p_initial/2, and their y-components are a and -a.

So, the angle each makes with the x-axis is theta = arctan(a/(p_initial/2)) = arctan(2a/p_initial).

So, let me compute 2a/p_initial.

Wait, since a = sqrt(9 - (p_initial/(2 m_e c))²) * m_e c.

Wait, perhaps I can find this ratio in terms of the Lorentz factors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by considering the invariant mass or something else.

Wait, another thought: The annihilation of electron and positron produces two photons. Since the electron and positron are each other's antiparticles, their rest mass is 2 m_e c^2. But wait, their energies and momenta are given via their Lorentz factors.

But the initial energy is 6 m_e c^2, as calculated before.

Wait, but perhaps using the center of momentum frame could help. Let me think.

In the center of momentum frame (where total momentum is zero), the photons would probably move in opposite directions, each with energy equal to the rest mass energy, which is 1 m_e c^2 each. Because the rest mass of the system is 2 m_e c^2, so each photon would have energy m_e c^2. But wait, that's just my initial thought.

But let me compute the center of momentum (COM) frame velocity. The initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The total energy is 6 m_e c².

The COM frame velocity beta is given by (p_initial c) / E_total.

So, beta = (p_initial c) / (E_total).

p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So, beta = [ m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) c ] / (6 m_e c²) ) = [ m_e c² (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) ] / (6 m_e c²) ) ) → beta = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) /6.

So, gamma_com = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

But perhaps I don't need to compute the COM frame. Hmm.

Wait, but in the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. So after the collision, the photons would have to move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But since they have the same energy, they would move in exactly opposite directions, perhaps 180 degrees apart. But that's only if their momentum vectors are opposite, which would require their angles to sum to 180 degrees. But in this problem, the photons are both moving to the right, but in different vertical directions. So perhaps this approach isn't directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of the two photons' momenta is along the x-axis, and each has the same energy, which leads to the angle each makes with the x-axis being theta and -theta. Thus, the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, back to that, theta is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis, and the angle between them is 2 theta.

Which, as computed earlier, is about 2*69=138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which matches. So I think that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the two photons.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor of \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and its momentum is \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e \). Using \( v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} \), we find \( p_e = m_e c \sqrt{15} \).
   - The positron has a Lorentz factor of \( \gamma_p = 2 \), and its momentum is \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p \). Using \( v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} \), we find \( p_p = -m_e c \sqrt{3} \) (negative because it moves to the left).
   - The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]

2. **Photon Properties**:
   - After annihilation, the system produces two photons with equal energy, \( E_1 = E_2 = E \). Since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by \( E = pc \). Thus, both photons have the same momentum magnitude, \( p_1 = p_2 = p \).
   - The total energy before annihilation is:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
     \]
     After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 2E \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
     \]
     Hence, the momentum of each photon is \( p = \frac{E}{c} = 3 m_e c \).

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - The photons are emitted symmetrically about the x-axis, with one moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. Let the momentum components of the photons be \( (p_{x1}, p_{y1}) \) and \( (p_{x2}, p_{y2}) \).
   - Conservation of momentum along the x-axis:
     \[
     p_{x1} + p_{x2} = p_{\text{initial}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
   - Conservation of momentum along the y-axis:
     \[
     p_{y1} + p_{y2} = 0 \implies p_{y2} = -p_{y1}.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum Components**:
   - Since the photons have equal energy and are emitted symmetrically, their magnitudes are equal:
     \[
     \sqrt{p_{x1}^2 + p_{y1}^2} = \sqrt{p_{x2}^2 + p_{y2}^2} = p = 3 m_e c.
     \]
   - Solving for \( p_{x1} \), \( p_{x2} \), and \( p_{y1} \), we find:
     \[
     p_{x1} = p_{x2} = \frac{p_{\text{initial}}}{2}, \quad p_{y1} = p_{y2} = \sqrt{p^2 - \left(\frac{p_{\text{initial}}}{2}\right)^2}.
     \]

5. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - Each photon makes an angle \( \theta \) with the x-axis, where:
     \[
     \tan\theta = \frac{p_{y1}}{p_{x1}} = \frac{\sqrt{p^2 - \left(\frac{p_{\text{initial}}}{2}\right)^2}}{\frac{p_{\text{initial}}}{2}}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( p = 3 m_e c \) and \( p_{\text{initial}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \), we compute:
     \[
     \tan\theta = \frac{2a}{p_{\text{initial}}}, \quad \text{where } a = \sqrt{p^2 - \left(\frac{p_{\text{initial}}}{2}\right)^2}.
     \]
   - After calculations, \( \theta \approx 69^\circ \). Since the photons are symmetrically placed about the x-axis, the angle between them is \( 2\theta \approx 138^\circ \).

### Conclusion:
The angle between the directions of the two photons is **138 degrees**.

Answer: C
