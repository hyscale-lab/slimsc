Okay, so I've got this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question gives me two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and a temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected via transit and RV methods, so that tells me they're likely exoplanets.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 times Earth's. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, which in turn affects their equilibrium temperature.

The problem mentions the Doppler shift from the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the planets' velocities? Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. So higher shift would mean higher velocity, perhaps.

Wait, but the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for Doppler shift in terms of velocity is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. But wait, the exact formula can be tricky. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to get into that. The question is about equilibrium temperatures. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give the orbital distances. Hmm, but maybe I can get the distance from the RV data?

Alternatively, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance from the star) through Kepler's third law. Because the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star, which in turn relates to the planet's orbital period and distance.

Wait, but the problem says both are in circular orbits. So for each planet, the RV gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. K is related to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis (a) of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula for K is: K = (v * (M_planet) ) / (M_star) ) ? No, wait, I think the formula is K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^1/3 )) )

Wait that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (2 pi G) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ]

But since the planets are detected via RV, and they're likely in the same system, we can assume same inclination i (sin i is close to 1) and same star (M_star is same). Also, e is zero for circular orbits.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1/a)^(1/2), maybe? Or perhaps the other way around. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v * (M_p)) / (M_star) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. The RV method relies on the Doppler shift due to the star's movement. The maximum velocity of the star (K) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. But without knowing the period, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, maybe the problem is giving me the Doppler shifts, which relate to K, the semi-amplitude. So for each planet, the semi-amplitude K is different, which can be used to find their semi-major axes (a1 and a2).

The Doppler shift is given as delta lambda over lambda = v/c. Wait, but the actual formula is delta lambda = (lambda) * (v/c), but in terms of shift, often we use the approximation that delta lambda / lambda = v/c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight.

Wait, but another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. So the Doppler shift is proportional to K. So if Planet1 has a shift of 0.03 Å and Planet2 has 0.04 Å, then K1=0.03 and K2=0.04? Or wait, no, because the line is at 6300 Å. So the shift is delta lambda = 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for the two planets.

So delta lambda / lambda = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6. Similarly, for Planet2, it's 0.04 /6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

But velocity v (K) is related to delta lambda via:

v = c * (delta lambda) / lambda

Wait, but what's the speed of light here? Let me think in terms of the RV formula. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^{2/3} * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(c * (P/(2 pi)) )^{1/3} ) ) ... Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to use the simplified version.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude K and the orbital distance a. The standard formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) ) / (c )

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead use the fact that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1/a)^(1/2). Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star)

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c )

But without knowing P, the period, perhaps we can find the ratio of K1 to K2 and then relate that to the ratio of a1 to a2, since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/2) or something.

Wait, from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G (M_star + M_p))

Given that M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate P² ≈ (4 pi² a³) / (G M_star )

So P is proportional to a^{3/2} / sqrt(M_star)

So P = (4 pi² a³ / (G M_star )) )^(1/2 )

Wait, perhaps I can relate the RV semi-amplitude K to the semi-major axis a.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star)^{1/3} ( (a (1 - e²) )^{1/2} ) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / (c) )

Wait, I think another way: K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (2 pi G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G M_star )

So P = 2 pi (a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substituting this into K:

K = [ (2 pi G) / (c * 2 pi (a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Simplify the expression inside the cube root:

(2 pi G) / (c * 2 pi (a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )) ) = (G) / (c * (a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )) )

Which is G / [ c * (a^(3/2) ) / ( G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ) ) ]

= G * G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) / [ c a^(3/2) ]

= G^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / ( c a^(3/2) )

So now K is:

[ G^(3/2) M_star^(1/2) / ( c a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_star^(2/3 )

= [ G^(3/2) ]^(1/3) [ M_star^(1/2) ]^(1/3) [c a^(3/2)]^(-1/3) * M_p / M_star^(2/3 )

Simplify exponents:

G^( (3/2)*(1/3) ) = G^(1/2)
M_star^( (1/2)*(1/3) ) = M_star^(1/6)
c^( -1/3 )
a^( (3/2)*(-1/3) ) = a^(-1/2 )
Multiply by M_p and M_star^(-2/3 )

So K = G^(1/2) * M_star^(1/6) * M_p / [ c^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(2/3) ]

Simplify M_star exponents: 1/6 - 2/3 = 1/6 - 4/6 = -3/6 = -1/2.

So K = [ G^(1/2) M_p ] / [ c^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) ]

Factor out the exponents:

K = (G M_p )^(1/2) / ( c^(1/3) a^(1/2) M_star^(1/2) )

= sqrt( G M_p ) / ( c^(1/3) a^(1/2) sqrt( M_star ) )

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can express K in terms of a.

Let me rewrite:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/2) / ( c^(1/3) a^(1/2) )

But another approach is to take the ratio of K1 and K2.

So K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (a2 / a1 )^(1/2) ) ] * [ ( sqrt( M_p1 / M_p2 ) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe I should compute K1 and K2 in terms of a1 and a2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write K as proportional to (M_p / sqrt(a)) ), because from the above expression:

K is proportional to sqrt(M_p) / sqrt(a) times other terms that are constants for the same star.

Wait, because G, M_star, c are constants for a given star. So K ∝ sqrt( M_p ) / sqrt( a )

So K1/K2 = ( sqrt( M_p1 / M_p2 ) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, no, let me think. From the expression above:

K = ( sqrt( G M_p ) ) / ( c^(1/3) a^(1/2) sqrt( M_star ) )

So K is proportional to sqrt(M_p) / ( a^(1/2) )

Which is the same as K ∝ sqrt( M_p ) / sqrt( a )

So K ∝ sqrt( M_p / a )

Therefore, K1/K2 = sqrt( ( M_p1 / a1 ) / ( M_p2 / a2 ) )

Which can be rearranged as ( ( M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) )^(1/2 )

Hmm, okay, but I don't know a1 and a2 yet. But the problem gives me the Doppler shifts, which relate to K.

Wait, but the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So delta_lambda = K * (lambda / c )

Because K is velocity, and delta_lambda = (K * lambda ) / c.

So for each planet, delta_lambda = (K * lambda) / c.

Therefore, K is proportional to delta_lambda.

So K1 = (delta_lambda1 * c ) / lambda, same for K2.

So the ratio K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2.

Given delta_lambda1 is 0.03 Å and delta_lambda2 is 0.04 Å, so K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

But earlier, K1/K2 is sqrt( (M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) )

Wait, so 0.75 = sqrt( (7 * a2 ) / (5 * a1 ) )

Because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5.

So square both sides: (0.75)^2 = (7 a2 )/(5 a1 )

0.5625 = (7 a2 )/(5 a1 )

So 7 a2 = 5 * 0.5625 * a1

Which is 7 a2 = 2.8125 a1

So a2 = (2.8125 /7) a1 ≈ 0.4017857 a1.

Hmm, okay, so a2 is about 0.4018 a1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * c ) ) * (1/( (P/(2 pi) )^(1/3) ) )

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me go back.

We have K1/K2 = (delta_lambda1) / (delta_lambda2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75.

And from earlier, K1/K2 = sqrt( (M_p1 a2) / ( M_p2 a1 ) )

So 0.75 = sqrt( (7 a2) / (5 a1) )

Square both sides: 0.5625 = (7 a2)/(5 a1 )

So 7 a2 = 0.5625 *5 a1 → 7 a2 = 2.8125 a1 → a2 = (2.8125 /7 ) a1 ≈ 0.4017857 a1.

So a2 is about 0.4018 times a1.

Hmm, so Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1, since a2 is smaller.

Wait, but the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. So T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, yeah, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Since albedo A is the same for both planets, that term (1 - A) cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is sqrt( (R_star / (2 a1 )) / ( R_star / (2 a2 )) ) )

Simplify that: sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a2 ≈ 0.4017857 a1.

So sqrt(0.4017857) ≈ sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.6325.

Wait, wait, no, wait:

Wait, the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2 / a1 )

So a2 is about 0.4018 a1, so a2 / a1 ≈ 0.4018.

sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

So T_eq1 is about 0.634 times T_eq2. So the ratio T_eq1 : T_eq2 is approximately 0.634 : 1.

Wait, but wait, let me compute the exact value.

a2 = (2.8125 /7 ) a1 = 2.8125 is 2.8125, which is 2.8125 / 7 ≈ 0.4017857.

So a2 / a1 = 0.4017857.

sqrt(0.4017857) ≈ let me compute that.

0.63^2 = 0.3969. 0.634^2 = 0.401956. So 0.634^2 ≈ 0.401956, which is very close to 0.4017857.

So sqrt(0.4017857) ≈ 0.634.

Therefore, T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.634.

So the ratio is about 0.634. But looking at the options, the closest option is C) ~0.53 or A) ~0.98, etc.

Wait, none of the options are around 0.63. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I messed up the equilibrium temperature formula. Let me double-check.

The equilibrium temperature formula is derived from the balance between the incoming stellar flux and the outgoing thermal radiation.

Incoming flux from the star: S = L_star / (4 pi a² )

Outgoing flux: sigma T_eq^4 ( (1 - A) )

Assuming isotropic emission and no greenhouse effect, etc.

So L_star is the star's luminosity, which is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So substituting L into S:

S = (4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / (4 pi a² ) ) = ( R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / a².

Set S = sigma T_eq^4 (1 - A )

So ( R_star^2 sigma T_star^4 ) / a² = sigma T_eq^4 (1 - A )

Cancel sigma from both sides.

(R_star² T_star^4 ) / a² = (1 - A ) T_eq^4

Take fourth root:

T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / a )^(1/2 ) / ( (1 - A )^(1/4) )

Which can be written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / a ) / ( (1 - A )^(1/4) )

But since albedo is the same for both planets, (1 - A )^(1/4) is a constant factor and cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is the same as before. So my approach was correct.

So, going back, a2 is approximately 0.4018 a1, so the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(0.4018) ≈ 0.634.

But the options don't have 0.63. The closest is option C) 0.53, but that's quite a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ratio.

Wait, let me double-check the K1/K2 ratio and the subsequent steps.

So K1=0.03, K2=0.04.

Wait, so K1 = (v1) = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

Wait, no, the actual formula is delta_lambda = (v * lambda)/c.

So delta_lambda = v * (lambda / c )

So v = delta_lambda * c / lambda.

So K1 = v1 = (0.03 Å) * c / (6300 Å )

Similarly, K2 = (0.04 Å) * c / (6300 Å )

Thus, K1 = (0.03 / 6300 ) * c and K2 = (0.04/6300 ) * c.

So the ratio K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75.

So that part is correct.

Earlier, K1/K2 = sqrt( ( M_p1 a2 )/( M_p2 a1 ) )

So 0.75 = sqrt( (7 a2) / (5 a1) )

0.75^2 = (7 a2) / (5 a1 )

0.5625 = (7 a2)/(5 a1 )

Multiply both sides by 5 a1:

5 a1 * 0.5625 =7 a2

2.8125 a1 =7 a2 → a2 = (2.8125 /7 ) a1 ≈ 0.4017857 a1.

So that's correct.

So a2 = 0.4017857 a1.

Thus, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.4017857) ≈ 0.634.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the RV semi-amplitude K.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's mass? Or maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c )

But since M_p << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c )

We can also write Kepler's law:

P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, P² ≈ (4 pi² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = 2 pi (a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substitute P into K:

K ≈ ( (G M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / (2 pi a^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, wait, perhaps I should find K in terms of a.

Wait, let me try again.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So (P/(2 pi)) )^2 = a³/( G M_star )

Take cube root: (P/(2 pi) )^(2/3) ) = a/( G M_star )^(1/3 )

So substituting into K formula:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )/ M_star )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c

= ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) )^(1/3 ) / (P^(1/3) ) ) / c 

But from P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star ), P = 2 pi a^(3/2) / ( sqrt( G M_star ) )

So P^(1/3) = (2 pi )^(1/3) a^(1/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/6 )

So substituting back into K:

K ≈ [ ( G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( (2 pi )^(1/3) a^(1/2) (G M_star )^(-1/6 ) ) ) ] / c

Simplify:

The (2 pi )^(1/3) terms cancel.

We have:

[ ( G M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) / ( a^(1/2) ( G M_star )^(-1/6 ) ) ) ] / c.

Simplify denominator exponents:

G^(-1/6) = G^(-1/6 )

M_star^(-1/6 ) from (G M_star )^(-1/6 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (G M_star )^(-1/6 ) = G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )

So in the denominator, we have a^(1/2) * G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6 )

So the numerator is (G M_p / M_star )^(1/3 ) = G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3 )

So putting together:

[ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/3) ) ] / [ a^(1/2) G^(-1/6) M_star^(-1/6) ) ]

Combine exponents:

G: 1/3 - (-1/6 ) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.

M_p: 1/3.

M_star: -1/3 - (-1/6 ) = -1/3 + 1/6 = -1/6.

a: -1/2.

So the expression becomes:

( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) ) ) / ( a^(1/2) )

So K = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) ) / a^(1/2) ] / c.

Hmm, this seems more complicated than before.

But perhaps we can express K in terms of a.

Let me write K as:

K = (G^(1/2) ) / ( c a^(1/2) ) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/6) )

Which can be written as:

K = ( sqrt(G) ) / ( c sqrt(a) ) ) * ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( M_star^(1/6 ) )

So, K ∝ M_p^(1/3) / ( sqrt(a) M_star^(1/6) )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to take the ratio K1/K2.

So:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1^(1/3) ) / ( sqrt( a1 ) M_star^(1/6) ) ) ] / [ (M_p2^(1/3) ) / ( sqrt( a2 ) M_star^(1/6) ) ) ]

Simplify:

= ( M_p1^(1/3) / M_p2^(1/3) ) * ( sqrt( a2 ) / sqrt( a1 ) )

= ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So:

K1/K2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(1/3 )

But earlier, we found that K1/K2 = 0.75, and M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

So:

0.75 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * (7/5 )^(1/3 )

Compute (7/5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (1.4 )^(0.3333 ) ≈ approximately 1.116.

So:

0.75 / 1.116 ≈ 0.75 / 1.116 ≈ 0.6728.

So:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ≈ 0.6728

So a2 / a1 ≈ (0.6728 )^2 ≈ 0.4528.

So a2 ≈ 0.4528 a1.

Hmm, this is different than the previous a2 of 0.4018 a1.

Wait, so earlier, I had a different approach which gave a different a2. This suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the previous approach.

So let's recompute.

Given:

K1/K2 = 0.75

From the new approach:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So:

0.75 = ( (7/5 )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Calculate (7/5)^(1/3):

7/5 =1.4. Cube root of 1.4 is approximately 1.116.

So 0.75 = 1.116 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.116:

0.75 / 1.116 ≈ 0.6728 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Square both sides:

(0.6728 )^2 ≈ 0.4528 = a2/a1.

So a2 = 0.4528 a1.

This is different from the previous a2 of 0.4018 a1.

So which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the initial approach, and the correct one is the second.

Because the correct formula for K includes M_p^(1/3), not M_p^(1/2).

So I probably made a mistake in the first approach; the correct proportionality is K ∝ M_p^(1/3) / sqrt(a ), not sqrt(M_p)/sqrt(a).

So yes, the second approach gives a different a2 ratio.

So with a2 = 0.4528 a1.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.4528 ) ≈ 0.6728.

Hmm, so about 0.673.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures directly.

The equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

Wait, wait, let me think: the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A )^(1/4) )

So because both have the same albedo, (1 - A )^(1/4) is the same for both.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So using the a2 from the second approach, a2 = 0.4528 a1.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(0.4528) ≈ 0.673.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual T_eq using the star's parameters.

The star has Teff = 6300 K, radius R_star =1.2 R_sun.

Wait, perhaps the star's luminosity is a factor. Because L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So the star's luminosity is L = (R_star / R_sun )^2 (T_star / T_sun )^4 * L_sun.

But for the equilibrium temperature, each planet's T_eq depends on L and a.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute L for the star, then compute T_eq for each planet.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the star's luminosity.

L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4

But since we are taking the ratio, perhaps I can compute the ratio between the two planets.

The equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A ) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

But since L is the same for both planets, and (1 - A ) is same, the ratio becomes:

(T_eq1 / T_eq2 )^4 = ( a2² ) / ( a1² )

Taking fourth root:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which brings us back to the same ratio.

So the ratio depends only on a1 and a2.

But from the RV method, we have to find a1 and a2.

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the initial assumption about K1/K2 being 0.75.

Because the Doppler shift is given as delta_lambda, but the actual formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c )

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the star's velocity due to the planet.

The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(1/3) * (1 - e² )^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/c )

But since e=0 and sin i ≈1, and M_p << M_star,

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c )

Hmm, perhaps integrating this with Kepler's third law would help.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the ratio a1/a2.

From the star's perspective, the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's law.

P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, since M_p << M_star, we can approximate P² ≈ (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So P = 2 pi (a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So P is proportional to a^(3/2) / sqrt( M_star )

But how does this relate to K?

From the RV semi-amplitude formula:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c )

Substituting P from above:

(2 pi / P ) = ( 2 pi ) / [ 2 pi (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ] = 1 / (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) = ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 )

So (2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 ) = ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )

So substituting back into K:

K = ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) ) / c

Simplify exponents:

(G M_p )^(1/3 ) * G^(1/6 ) = G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) M_p^(1/3 ) = G^(1/2 ) M_p^(1/3 )

M_star^(-1/3 ) * M_star^(1/6 ) = M_star^(-1/3 + 1/6 ) = M_star^(-1/6 )

So K = [ G^(1/2 ) M_p^(1/3 ) M_star^(-1/6 ) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

So K ∝ [ M_p^(1/3 ) ] / [ a^(1/2) M_star^(1/6 ) ]

So, the ratio K1/K2 is:

( M_p1^(1/3 ) / a1^(1/2) M_star^(1/6 ) ) / ( M_p2^(1/3 ) / a2^(1/2) M_star^(1/6 ) )

Which simplifies to:

( M_p1^(1/3 ) / M_p2^(1/3 ) ) * ( a2^(1/2 ) / a1^(1/2 ) )

So:

K1/K2 = ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Now, K1 is 0.03 and K2 is 0.04; so K1/K2 = 0.75.

M_p1 is 7 Earth masses; M_p2 is 5.

So:

0.75 = (7/5 )^(1/3 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Calculate (7/5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ (1.4 )^(0.3333 ) ≈ 1.116.

So,

0.75 = 1.116 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.116:

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.116 ≈ 0.6728.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ (0.6728 )^2 ≈ 0.4528.

Thus, a2 ≈ 0.4528 a1.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.4528 ) ≈ 0.673.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C) ~0.53, but that's too far off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact a2/a1 ratio.

Let me recompute 0.75 / 1.116:

1.116 * 0.6728 = approximately 0.75.

Wait, 1.116 * 0.6728 = ?

1.116 * 0.6 = 0.6696

1.116 * 0.0728 ≈ 0.081

Total ≈ 0.7506.

So yes, 0.75 = 1.116 * 0.6728.

So a2/a1 = (0.6728 )^2 = 0.4528.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(0.4528 ) = approximately 0.673.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I mixed up a1 and a2.

Wait, K1 is for Planet1, which has a semi-major axis a1.

K2 is for Planet2, semi-major axis a2.

In the ratio a2/a1, if a2 is smaller than a1, then the equilibrium temperature of Planet2 (which is closer) would be higher.

So the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 is sqrt(a2/a1 ) = 0.673, so T_eq1 is 0.673 times T_eq2.

Looking at the options, the closest I have is option C) ~0.53, which is lower; option A) ~0.98 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Alternatively, perhaps the equilibrium temperature formula should have the planet's radius in it, but I don't think so. The formula depends on the star's parameters and the planet's distance.

Wait, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, but different masses and radii. Oh, but the equilibrium temperature doesn't depend on the planet's radius, only on the distance and the star's parameters.

So, perhaps I have to think differently. Wait, perhaps the issue is that the RV method measures the mass function, which depends on the inclination angle. But the problem says both are detected via RV, so perhaps we can assume the same inclination, but I don't think that affects the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the actual equilibrium temperatures.

The star's luminosity is given by L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

The equilibrium temperature for each planet is:

T_eq = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ L (1 - A) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

But since both have the same albedo, A, this term is the same for both. So when taking the ratio, it cancels.

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ ( L / a1² ) / ( L / a2² ) ]^(1/4 )

= [ a2² / a1² ]^(1/4 )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which brings us back to the same ratio.

So, ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.673.

But options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual a1 and a2.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio of a1 and a2 from K.

Wait, let's define:

K1 = 0.03 Å, K2=0.04 Å.

But the actual formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( M_star ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi ) / P )^(1/3 ) ) / c )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² a³ )/( G M_star )

So P = 2 pi (a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Substitute into K:

K = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) (2 pi )^(1/3) ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) a^(-3/2) ) ] / c

Wait, let me redo this.

From K = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) ] * [ (2 pi ) / P ) ]^(1/3 ) / c.

But P = 2 pi (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So,

(2 pi / P )^(1/3 ) = [ (2 pi ) / ( 2 pi (a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ 1 / ( a^3/( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(3/2 ) ) ]^(1/3 )

= ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 )

So,

K = [ (G M_p )^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / a^(1/2 ) ) ] / c.

Combine terms:

= [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) / M_star^(1/3) ) * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

= [ G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) M_p^(1/3) M_star^( -1/3 + 1/6 ) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

= [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6 ) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6 ) ) / ( c a^(1/2) )

So,

K ∝ ( M_p^(1/3) ) / ( a^(1/2) )

Because G, M_star, and c are constants for the star.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1^(1/3) / a1^(1/2) ) / ( M_p2^(1/3) / a2^(1/2) )

= ( M_p1^(1/3) / M_p2^(1/3) ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) )

= ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(1/3 ) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

M_p1=7, M_p2=5.

So,

0.75 = ( (7/5 )^(1/3 ) ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

(7/5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.116.

So,

sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.116 ≈ 0.6728.

Thus,

a2/a1 ≈ (0.6728 )^2 ≈ 0.4528.

So a2 = 0.4528 a1.

Now, the equilibrium temperature ratio:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(0.4528 ) ≈ 0.673.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, but let's think about the Doppler shift in terms of velocity.

The Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v * lambda)/c.

So v = delta_lambda * c / lambda.

Given that lambda is 6300 Å, then for Planet1:

v1 = 0.03e-10 m * c / (6300e-10 m )

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters.

So delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda = 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m.

So v1 = (delta_lambda1 * c ) / lambda.

Similarly, v2 = (delta_lambda2 * c ) / lambda.

So,

v1 = (0.03e-10 * 3e8 m/s ) / 6300e-10

= (0.03 * 3e8 ) / 6300

= 9e6 / 6300 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

v2 = (0.04e-10 *3e8 ) /6300e-10 = (0.04 * 3e8 ) /6300 = 12e6 /6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct because the units don't match.

Wait, wait, no: delta_lambda is in meters, and lambda is also in meters.

Actually, let me compute it correctly.

delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda = 6300 Å =6300e-10 m.

v1 = (delta_lambda1 * c ) / lambda.

c =3e8 m/s.

So,

v1 = (0.03e-10 * 3e8 ) / (6300e-10 )

Simplify:

The e-10 cancels top and bottom.

= (0.03 *3e8 ) /6300

= 9e6 /6300 = 9e6 /6.3e3 = (9/6.3 )e3 ≈ 1.4286e3 m/s ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly,

v2 = (0.04e-10 *3e8 ) /6300e-10 = (0.04 *3e8 ) /6300 = 12e6 /6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So v1=1428.57 m/s, v2=1904.76 m/s.

These are the velocities of the star due to the planets.

In the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude K is this maximum velocity of the star.

So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.

Wait, no, no, wait. No, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity observed. So K1=1428.57 m/s and K2=1904.76 m/s.

But earlier I thought K1=0.03, K2=0.04, but that was incorrect. Because the problem states the shifts are up to 0.03 and 0.04 Å. So the K values are in m/s as calculated.

So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.

But earlier, I thought K1/K2=0.75, but now with the actual velocities, K1=1428.57, K2=1904.76.

So K1/K2=1428.57 / 1904.76 ≈ 0.75.

So earlier approach was correct.

So, going back, the ratio a2/a1=0.4528.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.4528 )= ~0.673.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual star's luminosity and the equilibrium temperatures.

The star's Teff is 6300 K, radius 1.2 R_sun.

Luminosity L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma Teff^4.

Equilibrium temperature of planet is T_eq = [ L (1-A) / (16 pi sigma a² ) ]^(1/4 )

So,

T_eq1 = [ L (1-A) / (16 pi sigma a1² ) ]^(1/4 )

T_eq2 = [ L (1-A) / (16 pi sigma a2² ) ]^(1/4 )

Taking the ratio:

(T_eq1 / T_eq2 )^4 = [ a2² / a1² ] → T_eq1 / T_eq2 = a2 / a1^(1/2 )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (T_eq1 / T_eq2 )^4 = ( a2² / a1² ) → T_eq1 / T_eq2 = ( a2 / a1 )^(1/2 )

So, same as before.

So, with a2/a1 =0.4528, ratio is sqrt(0.4528 )= ~0.673.

But looking at the options:

A) ~0.98 → closer to 1.

B) ~1.30 → higher.

C) ~0.53 → lower.

D) ~1.05 → close to 1.

None of these are near 0.673.

Wait, could there be an error in the calculation of K?

Wait, when calculating K using delta_lambda, perhaps I made a mistake.

Because delta_lambda is measured as a shift in the line. So in reality, the formula for K is:

K = (delta_lambda) * c / lambda.

But in the RV method, the Doppler shift (delta_lambda) is related to the velocity (v) via:

delta_lambda / lambda = v / c → v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda )

But in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å.

So for each planet, the velocity is:

v1 = c * (0.03 /6300 )

v2 = c * (0.04 /6300 )

So K1= v1= (3e8 m/s ) * (0.03 /6300 ) → let's compute:

0.03/6300 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 → wait, no:

0.03 /6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = approximately 4.7619e-6.

v1=3e8 *4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly, v2=3e8 * (0.04 /6300 )=3e8 * (4e-5/6.3e3 ) → 0.04/6300=4e-5 /6.3e3=6.349e-9.

Wait, no:

Wait, 0.04 is 4e-2, divided by 6300 is 4e-2 /6.3e3 = approx 6.349e-6.

So v2=3e8 *6.349e-6 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So K1=1428.57 m/s, K2=1904.76 m/s.

So K1/K2=0.75.

So the earlier approach is correct.

Thus, the ratio a2/a1=0.4528.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt(0.4528 )=0.673.

But no option matches this.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the ratio in terms of the star's luminosity.

Wait, the star's luminosity is L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So for Planet1, T_eq1 = [ L (1-A) / (16 pi sigma a1² ) ]^(1/4 )

Similarly, T_eq2 = [ L (1-A) / (16 pi sigma a2² ) ]^(1/4 )

Ratio:

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But from earlier, a2/a1=0.4528.

Thus,

T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt(0.4528 ) ≈ T_eq2 * 0.673.

So, the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2 is approximately 0.673.

But the options do not include this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the beginning in assuming that the RV semi-amplitude K is the same as the velocity of the star.

Wait, but RV semi-amplitude K is exactly the velocity of the star. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, which affects the calculation.

Wait, in the earlier steps, I used M_star=1.5 M_sun, but in the K formula, M_star is in the denominator.

Wait, when I compute K, the M_star is in the denominator, so for a given planet, if the star is more massive, the same K would imply a larger a.

Wait, but in our calculation, M_star was constant, so it's accounted for in the ratio.

Wait, let me re-express K in terms of a.

From K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) ) / ( c a^(1/2) )

So, solving for a:

a = [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_star^(-1/6) / ( c K ) ]^2

So,

a ∝ M_p^(2/3) M_star^(-1/3) / K²

So, a1 ∝ (7)^(2/3) (1.5)^(-1/3 ) / (K1^2 )

a2 ∝ (5)^(2/3) (1.5)^(-1/3 ) / (K2^2 )

Taking the ratio a2/a1:

( (5^(2/3) ) / (7^(2/3) ) ) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 )

Compute (5/7 )^(2/3 )= (5/7 )^(0.6667 ) ≈ (0.7143 )^(0.6667 )≈ 0.7143^0.6667 ≈ e^( ln(0.7143 ) * 0.6667 ) → ln(0.7143 )≈-0.3365 → -0.3365 *0.6667≈-0.2243 → e^(-0.2243 )≈0.8.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.8 * ( (1428.57 )^2 / (1904.76 )^2 )

Compute 1428.57^2 ≈ 2.04e6.

1904.76^2 ≈3.63e6.

Ratio (2.04e6 /3.63e6 )= ~0.562.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.8 * 0.562 ≈ 0.45.

Which aligns with the earlier result.

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.67.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's luminosity isn't the same as the Sun's, so the equilibrium temperature formula should use the star's parameters.

Wait, the star's luminosity is L =4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_star^4.

So,

L = (R_star/R_sun )^2 (T_star / T_sun )^4 L_sun.

But since we're taking the ratio of T_eq1 and T_eq2, which depends on a, perhaps the other terms cancel.

Wait, but when I compute T_eq, the star's L is used, but in the ratio T_eq1/T_eq2, the L cancels because they are the same star.

So the earlier approach holds.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach was to compute the ratio using the inverse square root of the ratio of the masses and the Doppler shifts.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, the mass function for a planet is:

f(M) = (M_p^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^2 (1 - e² ) )

But since e=0 and sin i≈1, f(M) = (M_p^3 ) / ( M_star^2 )

But the RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the observed Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps the observed semi-amplitude K relates to the mass function.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G / (2 pi c ) )^(1/3) ] * [ (f(M) )^(1/3) ) / ( a^(1/2) ) ]

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the planet's masses and the Doppler shifts to get the ratio of a.

Wait, from the RV method, for each planet, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i ) / a^(1/2 ) )

Assuming sin i is same for both.

So,

K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/2 )) / ( M_p2 /a2^(1/2 ) )

= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Compute 7/5=1.4.

So,

0.75 =1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

sqrt( a2/a1 )= 0.75 /1.4 ≈0.5357.

So,

a2/a1= (0.5357 )^2 ≈0.287.

Thus,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )= sqrt(0.287 )≈0.536.

Which is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C) ~0.53.

Wait, wait, this changes things.

Earlier, I thought K1/K2 =0.75= ( (7/5 )^(1/3 )) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

But perhaps the correct approach is that K is proportional to (M_p ) / sqrt(a ), without the 1/3 exponent.

So,

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / a1^(1/2 )) / (M_p2 /a2^(1/2 )) )

= ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 /a1 )

So,

0.75 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which gives sqrt( a2/a1 )=0.75/(7/5 )=0.75*(5/7 )=3.75/7≈0.5357.

So,

a2/a1≈0.5357²=0.287.

Thus,

T_eq1 / T_eq2= sqrt( a2/a1 )=sqrt(0.287 )≈0.536.

Which is approximately 0.53, matching option C.

So why did I get confused earlier?

Because I think I mixed up the formula for K. It seems that K is proportional to (M_p ) / sqrt(a ), not involving any cube roots.

Thus, the correct ratio is 0.53, option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant formulas for equilibrium temperature and radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude.

   - Planet1: \( M_1 = 7 M_{\oplus}, R_1 = 1.7 R_{\oplus} \)  
   - Planet2: \( M_2 = 5 M_{\oplus}, R_2 = 1.3 R_{\oplus} \)  
   - Both planets have the same albedo.

3. **RV Data**:  
   - Planet1 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \).  
   - Planet2 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \).  
   - The forbidden line is at \( \lambda = 6300 \, \text{Å} \).

### Step 1: Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the Doppler shift \( \Delta \lambda \), as \( K = \frac{\Delta \lambda \cdot c}{\lambda} \). Thus, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:  
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

### Step 2: Relationship Between \( K \), \( M_p \), and \( a \)
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the planet's mass \( M_p \), the orbital distance \( a \), and the star's mass \( M_{\text{star}} \). For circular orbits and \( M_p \ll M_{\text{star}} \), \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}} \). Thus:  
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 7 \, M_{\oplus} \), \( M_2 = 5 \, M_{\oplus} \), and \( K_1/K_2 = 0.75 \):  
\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( a_2 / a_1 \)
Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{7/5} = 0.75 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = 0.5357
\]

Squaring both sides:  
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

### Step 4: Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is given by:  
\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is:  
\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \( a_2 / a_1 \approx 0.287 \):  
\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]
