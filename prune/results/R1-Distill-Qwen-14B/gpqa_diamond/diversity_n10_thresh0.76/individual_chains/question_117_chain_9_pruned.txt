Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options give different combinations of these compounds. First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is all about. Oh right, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it has non-superimposable mirror images. These are also called enantiomers. So, the presence of chiral centers is key here.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected by a single bond. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, the structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Since it's a biphenyl, the possibility of axial chirality might come into play. Axial chirality is a type of stereoisomerism where the two rings have different configurations around the central bond. For example, binaphthyl compounds can exhibit this. But wait, does this compound have the necessary groups in such a way that the rings can't be rotated to mirror each other? If the substituents are in positions that allow for different configurations (like if they're on opposite sides), then there could be axial chirality here. Let me visualize... Each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. If the substituents are on opposite sides relative to the central bond, they can't be mirrored, leading to optical isomers. So yes, this compound probably has axial chirality and thus can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. Wait, the formula for this would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, right? Let me think about the structure. The molecule has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, esterified with methyl. The structure is: the central carbon (C2) has a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl group (from the ester), and two other substituents
