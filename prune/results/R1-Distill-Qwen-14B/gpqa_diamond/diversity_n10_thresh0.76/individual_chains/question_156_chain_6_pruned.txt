Okay, I need to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard and chiral.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So the first step in each reaction is probably forming an epoxide.

Wait, but what's the stereochemistry of the epoxide formation? I think when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the configuration of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's structure.

So, (E)-oct-4-ene. The E configuration means the higher priority groups (like the two CH2CH3 groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond. When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it does so in a way that the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face. Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond, and the way it adds depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.

So for an E-alkene, when mCPBA adds, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms coming from the same face. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with a trans (E) double bond—since the substituents are on opposite sides, the epoxide will form with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, I think that when mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the epoxide oxygen atoms are added from the same face. So for a trans double bond, the epoxide will have the two oxygen atoms on the same face, making the epoxide a trans configuration. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide formation is such that the diastereomers form based on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the diastereomers and enantiomers
