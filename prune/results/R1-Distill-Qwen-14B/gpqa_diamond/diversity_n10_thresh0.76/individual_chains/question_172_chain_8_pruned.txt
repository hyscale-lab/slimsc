Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when we're dealing with the excitation of atoms in stars, it's related to the thermal energy of the photosphere. Oh right, it's about the Boltzmann distribution.

The problem says that iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. So the population ratio between the excited state and the ground state (or another lower state) is 2:1 for star 1 compared to star 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the number of atoms in the excited state is higher in star_1 than star_2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, 1.38e-23? That number looks familiar. Oh right, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, right? Or wait, for the Boltzmann factor, it's ΔE/(kT). Oh yeah, the probability of being in an excited state is proportional to e^(-ΔE/(kT)).

So the ratio of the populations of the excited state (E_upper) to the ground state (E_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is [N_upper / N_lower] = e^(-ΔE/(k T1)). Same for star 2, but with T2. 

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. Wait, I need to be precise. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So does that mean the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2 for the same level? Or is it that the excitation energy is twice as much?

Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of atoms in that specific energy level is higher in
