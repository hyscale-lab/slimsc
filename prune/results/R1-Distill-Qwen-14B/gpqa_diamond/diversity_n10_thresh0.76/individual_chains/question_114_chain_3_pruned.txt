Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Let me think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism is probably the formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl carbon. But to make a cyanohydrin, I think the conditions are acidic because the H+ helps stabilize the transition state or something like that. Oh yeah, I think it's using an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or maybe something else. So reagent A is probably a proton source, like sulfuric acid, or H3O+.

The second reaction is more complex. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and reagent B in the presence of water leads to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid? Oh, I think that's the hydrolysis of a nitrile. But how?

Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. The typical way to get a carboxylic acid is to have strong acidic or basic conditions with water. But wait, I remember that in some cases, like using HCl (H+ and Cl-), it can protonate the nitrile and help in the addition of water. Alternatively, using H2O with a catalyst might work. But wait, in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group. Now, in the second reaction, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's an oxidation followed by hydrolysis, but no, wait, looking at the structure: the nitrile is in the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. Oh wait no, wait the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the cyanide group (CN) is converted to a COOH group.

Wait, so the structure before reaction is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Maybe it's a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But usually, nitriles hydrolyze to amides first under certain conditions, and then further. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, maybe it's a direct hydrolysis.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN in the presence of H3O+ (if A is H3O+ from option A or B). So that would generate a cyanohydrin: adding CN- and H+ to the ketone. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the product.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now for the second reaction
