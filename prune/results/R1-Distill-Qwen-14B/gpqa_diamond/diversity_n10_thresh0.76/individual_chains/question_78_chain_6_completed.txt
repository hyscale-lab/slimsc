Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described using scalar and vector potentials.

The question is about finding the expressions for V (scalar potential) and A (vector potential) at a certain point and time. The setup involves a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a later time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated.

Wait, let me think about how potentials work. The scalar potential, V, is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential, A, with the magnetic field. The standard forms I remember are for static charges, but here the charge is moving, so things might be different.

I recall that the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the simple Coulomb potential anymore because of the motion. Oh right, there's this concept called retarded time, where the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So the potentials should be functions of tr, which is the time it takes for the field to propagate from the charge's position to the observation point.

Wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is r - s(tr), because s(tr) is the position of the charge when the field was generated. So the distance from the charge at time tr to the field point is |d|, which is the same as |r - s(tr)|.

Now, the scalar potential V for a moving charge. In the static case, it's V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, does this change? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the scalar potential might still be similar but considering the retarded time. But wait, in the options, all the Vs look like they're using r or d, so maybe it's more about the form rather than time dependence.

Wait another thing, the problem says t > tr. So the observation time is after the field was generated. So the field at time t is due to the charge's state at time tr, which is earlier. So I need to express V and A in terms of the charge's position and velocity at tr.

For a moving charge, the potentials are generally given by solutions to Maxwell's equations, considering the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| - (v · d̂) tr / c ) ]? Or maybe I should think in terms of the Liénard potentials.

Wait, no, let me think again. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * (1 - (v · r̂)/c² ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the expression for V is similar to the Coulomb potential but multiplied by a factor involving the velocity.

Looking at the options, option C and D have V with terms involving d·v. Let me see: in option C, V has qc/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)). Hmm.

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( r' ), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r. But r' can be expressed in terms of d. Since d = r - s(tr), the position of the charge is s(tr), so the distance is |d|.

Wait but the expression in the options don't involve r, they involve d. So maybe the denominator is in terms of (d c - d · v), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that when you have a moving charge, the potentials can involve terms with velocity. For the scalar potential, the leading term is the Coulomb potential, and then there's a term involving the velocity. But I'm not exactly sure about the form.

Wait, another approach: The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field as E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field is B = ∇×A.

In the case of a moving point charge, the potentials are such that the electric field is the sum of the Coulomb field and a term involving the velocity. But for potentials, perhaps V is given by the Coulomb-like term, and A is a term proportional to the velocity.

Looking at the options, options A and B have V as Coulomb potential, but without any velocity terms. Options C and D have V scaled by factors involving c, the speed of light, and terms like d·v.

Wait, perhaps the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - d·v)], but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, in the context of retarded potentials, the denominator would involve the distance minus the component of velocity times time. Let me think in terms of Lorentz transformations or the retarded time.

The retarded time tr is given by tr = (|r - s(tr)| ) / c. So, tr = |d| / c.

Wait, but if I think about the denominator in V, perhaps it's (d c - d · v). Let me compute d · v. d is the vector from the charge's position to r, and v is the velocity of the charge at time tr.

So (d · v) would be |d| * v * cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So, if I have d c - d·v, that's |d| (c - v cosθ). Hmm, but why would that appear in the denominator?

Wait, another thought: the potentials might have terms that account for the motion of the charge. For instance, the vector potential A is often proportional to the velocity of the charge. Let me consider that.

In the case of a static charge, A is zero because there's no current. When the charge is moving, there's a current, so A becomes non-zero. The vector potential due to a moving charge is usually given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * something, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, option B has A as (v/c²) times V. So if V is Coulomb's law, then A is (v/c²) * [q/(4πε₀ r)].

Wait, but what about the direction? The vector potential should be in the same direction as the velocity, I think.

Another angle: The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations, so the fields derived from them must satisfy the equations. Let me think about the electric field E. From the potentials, E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. For a static charge, the time derivative of A is zero, so E is -∇V, which gives the Coulomb field. But when A is present, which has a time derivative, it contributes to E.

But in this case, the charge is moving, so the vector potential A will be a function of time, leading to a term in E. But perhaps the potentials are constructed such that both E and B are correctly accounted for.

Wait, I remember that in the case of a moving charge, the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( |r - r’| - (v · (r - r’)) / c² ) ]

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are written in terms of the velocity and the displacement.

Alternatively, think about the expansion for small velocities. If the charge's velocity is much less than c, we can perhaps Taylor expand the expressions.

Wait, but the options don't seem to require a small velocity approximation. So perhaps the expressions are exact.

Let me look at the options again.

Option A: V is Coulomb, A is (v²/c²) V. That would make A a scalar multiple of V, but the vector potential is a vector, so this would imply A is in the same direction as v squared, which doesn't make sense. Because v squared is a scalar, so A would be a vector scaled by v squared. But v is a vector, so perhaps it's (v^2 is a scalar). Wait, no, the notation may be ambiguous. Is it (v squared) or (v vector squared?), but in any case, option A's A is scalar multiplied by V.

Option B: A is (v / c²) V. So the vector potential is velocity times the scalar potential divided by c squared. But velocity is a vector, so this would make A a vector. That seems plausible. 

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ0 qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Option D: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c + d·v)), and A is (mu0 qc v)/(4 pi (d c + d·v)).

Wait, the denominator in option C and D is (d c ± (d·v)). Let me compute what that is. d is a vector, so d c is c times vector d. Then d·v is a scalar. So (d c - d·v) would be a vector with each component multiplied by c, minus a scalar. That doesn't make sense dimensionally because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector. Oh wait, no, d c is a vector (d is a vector, multiplied by c, a scalar), and d·v is a scalar. So the denominator is a vector (d c) minus a scalar (d·v), which can't be correct. Hmm, that seems wrong. Because you can't add or subtract vectors and scalars. So that suggests that options C and D might have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the denominator. Maybe it's supposed to be (d · (c) - d · v), but that would be scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - d·v). Because |d| is the magnitude, so c |d| is a scalar, and d·v is a scalar as well. So the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)).

So, perhaps the correct expression is (c |d| - (d · v)) in the denominator for V and A.

Wait, but how is that written in the options? Let me check option C: denominator is (d c - d·v). That's a vector (d multiplied by c) minus a scalar, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)), because |d| is the magnitude, and d·v is the scalar product. So that would make sense because both are scalars.

But the options don't write it that way. So perhaps the options are written in a way that d c is |d| multiplied by c, but that's not standard notation. Because d is a vector, and c is a scalar, so d multiplied by c is still a vector. So perhaps the options are written in a way that 'd c' is a scalar, which would be |d| multiplied by c.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - |d| (v·d̂)), which is |d| (c - v·d̂). But I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps in the options, the denominator is (d c - d·v) as a scalar. But that would require d c to be a scalar, which would only be the case if d is the magnitude. That doesn't seem right.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of another approach. 

When a charge is moving, the potentials are given by the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( r’ ) ] where r’ is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time, and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [1/( r’ ) ].

Wait, but I might be mixing up the terms. Another thought: The potentials can be expressed in terms of the retarded time tr, which is the time it takes for the influence of the charge to reach the observation point.

So, tr = (|d| ) / c, because d is the vector from the charge's position to the field point. Now, the velocity at time tr is v.

The scalar potential V would then be something like (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )) ].

Wait, because when the charge is moving, the denominator gets adjusted by a Lorentz factor-like term. So 1/( |d| (1 - beta · d̂ )) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait, but if I expand 1/(1 - beta · d̂ ), it's approximately 1 + beta · d̂ for small beta, but for exact expressions, it's kept as 1/(1 - beta · d̂ ).

So, the denominator would be |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ). So, |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c) = |d| (c - (v · d̂ ) |d| ) / c. Hmm, not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the denominator can be written as c |d| - (v · d). Because d · v is |d| |v| cosθ, so (v · d) = |d| (v · d̂). So,

c |d| - (v · d) = |d| (c - (v · d̂)).

Which would be the same as |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) * c. Because c |d| - (v · d) = c |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/(c)) / something?

Wait, no, let's compute it:

c |d| - (v · d) = c |d| - |d| (v · d̂) = |d| (c - (v · d̂)).

So, the denominator in V(r,t) would be (c |d| - (v · d)), which is |d| (c - (v · d̂)).

So, V(r,t) would be (q c)/(4π ε₀) ( 1/(c |d| - (v · d)) ) ), because when you factor out |d| from denominator, you get 1/(|d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ) ) = (1/|d| ) [1/(c (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ].

Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = [ q ] / [4π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v )). But since d c is a vector, this would be vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps option C and D are miswritten.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which is a scalar, and that's what's in the denominator.

In that case, V(r,t) would have denominator (c |d| - (v · d) ), which is the same as option C if d c is |d| c. But as written, option C's denominator is d c - d · v, which is vector minus scalar, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct form is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar.

So, the only option that has this in the denominator is C and D, but they wrote the denominator as d c - d · v, which is vector minus scalar, which is not correct. Unless I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Maybe the options are using d as |d|? That is, treating d as the magnitude. But in the problem, d is a vector. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the correct expressions involve terms like 1/(r' ), where r' is the distance adjusted by the motion of the charge. So, r' = |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ), so 1/(r') = 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ) = [1/( |d| ) ] * [ 1/(1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ].

But in terms of the potentials, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the units in the options.

Looking at option B: V is Coulomb potential, A is (v / c²) * V. Let's check the units.

V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. A has units of T·m (tesla-meter), which is kg/(s²·A) * m.

Wait, let's compute the units of each option.

Option B: V = q/(4πε₀ r) → [V] = [C]/([C²/(N·m²)] * m) ) → N·m²/C² * C/(m) ) → (N·m²/(C²)) * (C)/(m) ) → N·m²/(C) / m → N·m/(C) → (kg·m²/s²)/(C) → which is volts, correct.

A in option B: (v / c²) * V. Units of v are m/s, c is m/s, so v/c² is (m/s)/(m²/s²) ) = s/m.

Multiply by V (volts), which is J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C.

So, (s/m) * (kg·m²/s²/C) ) → kg·m²/(s·m C) ) → kg·m/(s·C) → which is (kg·m/s² ) * s/(C) → N·s/(C) → which is (V·s), since V is J/C = (N·m)/C. So, (N·s)/C = (V·s)/ (C) * C → V·s.

Wait, but the unit of A is Wb/A (since B is T, and A is Wb/A) → T·m = (kg/(s²·A)) * m → kg·m/(s²·A).

So option B's A would have units (s/m) * (kg·m²/s²/C) ) → kg·m/(s·C ) → kg/(s·C) * m → (kg·m) / (s·C). Hmm, not matching.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't helping. Let me think about the general expressions.

The scalar potential due to a charge q moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |r - r’| ) ] * ( 1/(1 - (v · (r - r’))/c² |r - r’| ) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's 1/( |r - r’| (1 - (v · (r - r’))/c² ) )

Because the denominator includes a factor from the Lorentz contraction.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the denominator is |r - r’| multiplied by (1 - β · r̂ ), where β = v/c and r̂ is the unit vector in the direction from the charge to the field point.

So, the denominator is |r - r’| (1 - β · r̂ ) = |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c )

Hmm, so V becomes (q/(4π ε₀ )) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as (q c)/(4π ε₀ |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) )

But |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) = c |d| - (v · d̂ ) |d| ) = c |d| - (v · d)

Because d · v = |d| (v · d̂ ).

So, the denominator is c |d| - (v · d).

So, V(r, t) = [ q c ] / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Looking at the options, option C has V as ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ (d c - d · v) ]

Wait, but d c is a vector multiplied by c, so d c is a vector. So the denominator would be vector d c - scalar (d · v). That doesn't make sense dimensionally. So perhaps the options have a mistake, or I'm misinterpreting.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)), which is a scalar. So, in that case, option C would have the denominator as (d c - d · v), which is vector minus scalar, which is not correct. So perhaps none of the options are correctly written, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, and the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d)).

Assuming that, then option C's V is ( q c ) / [4 π ε₀ ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which matches our expression.

So then, the V would be option C's expression.

Now, what about the vector potential A.

In general, A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ) ]

Wait, let me think. The vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A(r, t) = ( μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ) ].

So, substituting, this becomes ( μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( (c |d| - (v · d)) / c ) ) ].

Because |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) = (c |d| - (v · d) ) / c.

Wait, no, let me compute:

1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) = 1/( [ (c |d| - (v · d) ) / c ] )

Which is c / ( c |d| - (v · d) ) .

So substituting back into A:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c/( c |d| - (v · d) ) ) ] 

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c / (c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ) * [ 1/( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which can be written as [ μ₀ q v ] / [4 π ( c |d| - (v · d) ) c ].

But looking at option C, the vector potential is ( μ₀ q c v )/(4 π (d c - d · v) )

Wait, if in the denominator, d c - d · v is c |d| - (v · d), then:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ) * [ 1/( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which is the same as (μ₀ q v )/(4 π ) * [ 1/( c (c |d| - (v · d) ) ) ]

Which is (μ₀ q v )/(4 π ) * [1/( c (denominator) ) ]

But in option C, the vector potential is (μ₀ q c v)/(4 π (d c - d · v) )

Which would be (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (c |d| - v · d ) ]

But in our calculation, we have (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c (c|d| - v · d) )

So unless I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of A. Let me recalculate.

The general form of A is (μ₀/(4π)) ( q v ) / (c² (1 - (v · r̂)/c )) ) * (1/|d| )

So,

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c )) ]

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( (c |d| - (v · d)) / c ) ]

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ c / (c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

= (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c ) * [ 1/( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

So, that's the same as (μ₀ q v ) / (4 π c (c |d| - (v · d) ) )

Which is (μ₀ q v ) / [4 π c (denominator) )

Looking at option C:

A is (μ₀ qc v )/(4 π (d c - d · v) )

Which is (μ₀ q c v ) / [4 π (denominator) ]

So, comparing with our expression, which is (μ₀ q v ) / [4 pi c (denominator) ), the option C has an extra c in the numerator.

So our calculation says A should have (μ₀ q v ) / (4 pi c denominator ), but option C has (mu0 q c v ) / denominator.

So they don't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general expression for A. Let me check another source in my mind.

The vector potential for a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q )/(4 π) * (v/(c²)) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ) ]

Which would be (μ₀ q v )/(4 π c² ) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂ )/c ) ) ]

So, same as before.

So, substituting the same steps as before, it's (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c (denominator) )

Which doesn't match option C. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the denominator in A is (c |d| - (v · d)), and the numerator is μ₀ q v, so A is (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi (c (c |d| - (v · d)) ) )

Which is (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c (denominator) )

But none of the options match exactly. Let me see option C's A:

(μ₀ q c v )/(4 pi (d c - d · v) )

If the denominator is (c |d| - (v · d) ), which is the same as (d c - d · v) if d c is |d| c. No, that's not correct. Because d is a vector, so d c is a vector multiplied by c. So the denominator in option C is vector minus scalar, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps in the options, d is the distance, not the vector. But the question defines d as a vector. So that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about whether the vector potential is proportional to v. So in option B, A is (v/c²) V. Since V is q/(4pi ε₀ r), then A would be [ q v ] / [4 pi ε₀ c² r ]

Then, A would have units of (C * m/s )/( (C²/(N m²)) * (m/s)^2 * m )

Wait, let me compute:

V has units: [ V ] = [ q ]/[4 pi ε₀ r ] → [C]/[C²/(N m²) * m ] → (N m²/C) * C/(m) ) → N m/(C) → V.

A in option B: [ (v/c^2 ) V ].

v is m/s, c^2 is m²/s², so v/c^2 is 1/(m s).

Multiply by V (V), which is J/C → (N m)/C.

So units of A would be (1/(m s)) * (N m/C) ) = N/(C s) → (V·s)/C → (V/(A)) because I = Q/s, so 1/A = s/C.

Wait, because 1 Ampere is 1 C/s, so 1/A is s/C.

So N/(C s) = (N m)/(C m s) ) → (V)/(A) * m.

Wait, but the unit for A is Tesla·meter (T·m), and 1 Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so T·m is kg·m/(s²·A).

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations, specifically, ∇ × A − ∂V/∂t = −J/ε₀. But J for a moving charge is q δ(r - s(t)) δ'(t − t'), so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the Lorentz gauge condition, where ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t =0. But I don't think that's directly helpful here.

Wait, another thought: The vector potential A is related to the magnetic field. The magnetic field of a moving charge (current element) is given by the Biot-Savart law. For a point charge moving with velocity v, the magnetic field at point d away is (μ₀ q (v × d̂ )) / (4 pi c² |d| ) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, Biot-Savart law is for current elements. For a moving charge, the current is a point current, so the magnetic field is (μ₀ q (v × r̂ )) / (4 pi c² |r| ), where r is the vector from the charge to the field point.

In terms of potentials, the vector potential A should satisfy B = ∇ × A.

If I can find A such that its curl gives this B, perhaps it's A = (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c² ) (r̂ ) / |r| )

Wait, but that would give a curl B that's proportional to the current, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c² ) * ( (r̂ ) / |r| )

But then when you take the curl, you get (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c² ) * ( (1/|r| ) ( ∇ × r̂ )) )

Which would give something involving the current.

Wait, perhaps I should give up and think that option C is the correct one, because it's the only one that has V and A expressions that are scaled by factors involving velocity and c.

But wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v), which is vector minus scalar, which is not correct. So perhaps the correct option is none of them. But that can't be the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the standard form.

I think the correct expressions for V and A involve 1/( c |d| - (v · d) ), so looking at the options, the only one with that in the denominator is option C and D, but their denominators are vector-scalar, which is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, assuming that in the options, d c is supposed to represent c |d|.

If that's the case, then V would be option C's expression, and A is (mu0 q c v) / [4 pi (c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

But our calculation for A was (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c (c |d| - (v · d) ) )

So, in option C, the numerator is (mu0 q c v ), which is c times what our calculation has. So unless there's a mistake in our calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of A. Let me check the general expression again.

Wait, the vector potential for a moving charge is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v )/( c² ) * [ 1/( |r - r’| (1 - (v · (r - r’))/c² |r - r’| ) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps the denominator is |r - r’| (1 - (v · (r - r’))/c² )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another thought: The potentials should satisfy the wave equations. But I'm not sure if that helps in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the potentials in the rest frame of the charge. In that frame, the charge is stationary, so A is zero, and V is Coulomb's law. But when you boost to the lab frame, you get the other terms.

But when you perform a Lorentz transformation, the scalar potential transforms as V' = V - (v A)/c², and A' = γ(A + (v × E)/c² ) - (γ-1) A, but that might not directly help here.

Wait, but in the rest frame, A is zero, so when you boost to the lab frame, A would be non-zero. So perhaps in the lab frame, the potentials are such that A is proportional to v times something.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because in option B, A is (v/c²) V, which would imply that A is proportional to the velocity. Considering that the vector potential is linked to the motion of the charge.

But in that case, let's see the dimensions again. If V is Coulomb's law, and A is (v/c²) V, then the units of A would be (m/s) * (V) / (m²/s²) ) = (V)/(m/s) ) → (V s/m ). But I'm not sure if that aligns.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct because V is Coulomb's law, and A is a term due to the movement, scaled by 1/c².

But I'm not certain. Another thought: the vector potential is often written as (μ₀ q v)/(4 π c² ) * something. So if we have to match the options, option C has A as (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi denominator ). Which would have an extra factor of c in the numerator.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the A is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c denominator ), so perhaps option C's A has an extra factor of c in the numerator, making it incorrect.

So, perhaps none of the options is correct, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the denominator. Wait, perhaps the denominator for A is same as that for V, which is ( c |d| - (v · d) ), so option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (c |d| - (v · d) ) )

Which, in terms, would be (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (denominator) )

But in our calculation, A was (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c (denominator) )

So, our expression is (mu0 q v ) / [4 pi c ( c |d| - (v · d) ) ]

Which is (mu0 q v ) / [4 pi c (denominator) ]

But option C's A is (mu0 q c v ) / [4 pi (denominator) ]

So, it's c times larger in the numerator than our calculation. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about getting back to the original expressions and see.

In the problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance between the charge and the field point at tr.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential adjusted for the motion. So,

V = ( q / (4 pi epsilon_0) ) * ( 1 / |d| ) * [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂ ) / c ) ]

Which can be written as ( q c ) / (4 pi epsilon_0 |d| (c - v · d̂ ) )

Which is ( q c ) / (4 pi epsilon_0 (c |d| - (v · d) ) )

Because v · d = |d| (v · d̂ )

So, that would match option C's V if the denominator is written as (d c - d · v )

But wait, in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v ), which is a vector (d multiplied by c) minus a scalar (d·v) which is impossible. So perhaps option C is incorrect in its notation.

But looking at the other options, option B's V is Coulomb, and A is (v/c²) V.

Hmm, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, the terms involving velocity are small, and the denominator becomes |d| approximately. So, in that case, V would be Coulomb, and A would be (μ₀ q v )/(4 pi c² ) * 1/|d|.

Which would be (μ0 q v )/(4 pi c² |d| ) → which could be written as (v/c² ) * [ q / (4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) ] * (epsilon_0 mu_0 c² )/(epsilon_0 mu_0 c² ) → but that's getting messy.

Alternatively, since 1/(epsilon_0 mu_0 ) = c², so mu_0 = c²/(epsilon_0 )

So, substituting into A,

A = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c² |d| )

= ( (c²/(epsilon_0 )) q v )/(4 pi c² |d| )

= ( q v )/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| )

= (v/c² ) * ( q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) ) * c²

Which would be (v/c² ) * [ q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) ] * c² = (v/c² ) * (1/epsilon_0 ) * [ q/(4 pi |d| ) ]

Wait, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps (v/c² ) * V, as in option B.

Because V = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ), so A = (v/c²) V.

Which would make A = (v/c² ) * q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| )

But our calculation earlier in the non-relativistic limit would have A as ( q v )/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) because mu0 q v/(4 pi c² |d| ) = ( q v )/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) * (mu0 c² )/(epsilon_0 c² )

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, the denominator (c |d| - (v·d) ) approaches c |d|, so the leading terms would be:

V ≈ ( q c ) / (4 pi epsilon_0 c |d| ) ) = q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ), which matches option B.

And A would be (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c (c |d| ) )

= (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| )

= ( q v )/(4 pi epsilon_0 c^2 |d| )

Because mu0 = 1/(epsilon0 c^2 )

So,

A ≈ ( q v )/(4 pi epsilon_0 c^2 |d| )

Which is (v/c² ) * ( q/(4 pi epsilon_0 |d| ) ) = (v/c² ) V.

So, in the non-relativistic limit, option B's expressions are correct.

Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option B.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the principles of electromagnetism. The charge \( q \) is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \). The potentials must satisfy Maxwell's equations and account for the motion of the charge.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \) is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \) is problematic because \( \vec{v}^2 \) is a scalar, and multiplying it by \( V \) would not yield a vector potential. This option is inconsistent with the vector nature of \( \vec{A} \).  

2. **Option B**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \) is the static Coulomb potential, which is valid only in the non-relativistic limit.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\vec{r}, t) \) is consistent with the non-relativistic approximation, where the vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) and scaled by \( 1/c^2 \). This matches the expected form of \( \vec{A} \) in the non-relativistic regime.  

3. **Option C**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) introduces a denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \). This term accounts for the motion of the charge and is consistent with relativistic corrections to the scalar potential.  
   - \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v} \) and includes a factor of \( \mu_0 \), which is expected for the vector potential. However, the denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) involves a scalar subtraction from a vector, which is dimensionally inconsistent.  

4. **Option D**:  
   - \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) are similar to Option C, but the denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is also dimensionally inconsistent for the same reason as in Option C.  

### Conclusion:
Option C and Option D are problematic due to the dimensionally inconsistent denominators. Option A is incorrect because it does not account for the motion of the charge. Option B is valid in the non-relativistic limit, where the scalar potential is Coulomb-like, and the vector potential is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \). Therefore, the most consistent choice is **Option B**.
