Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Wait, what's that exactly? Oh right, metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, that facilitates this.

The compound in question is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3) something? Wait, wait. Let me count. Pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, wait. No, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh, so the chain is five carbons long, and there's a methyl branch on carbon 3.

Wait, maybe I should write it out. Carbon 1 is the start of the double bond. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me number from the double bond. Oh no, wait, for pent-1-ene, it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 1. The substituent methyl is on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, pent is five carbons. So, the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, let's think: for pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The formula is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, if there's a methyl group on C3, then the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)CH₂CH3. Wait, but that would make the formula CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So that's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

But wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3: that's 5 carbons in the main chain, with a methyl on C3. So, yes, that's correct.

Now, the compound is racemic. That means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule has a chiral center. Let me check: looking at the structure, which carbons are chiral? The double bond is at C1 and C2. C3 has a CH(CH
