Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a construct where the coding sequence is modified to include a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that when they looked at the construct's plus strand sequence, they found an issue. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, so the person designed a construct to overexpress GADD45G. They added a HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected cells, but couldn't express the protein. So, the issue is in the construct's sequence.

Looking at the provided sequence, the plus strand starts with "ATG", which is the start codon, right? Then there's the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag is a small peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin. Its sequence is usually something like YPYDVPDYA, but in the construct, it's cloned via PCR or some method. So the issue might be with that.

Looking at the sequence given, starting right after the ATG. The next few codons would code for the HA tag. Let me think: HA tag is about 11 amino acids. The coding sequence should be in frame.

But wait, the question says the plus strand's sequence starts with 5'ATG TAC ... So looking at the first few triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait a sec, no, wait, let me parse that.

No, wait, the sequence is longer. Let me see. The first part is 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the first part is the coding sequence, right? So the first 3 nucleotides are ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine again), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), etc.

Wait, but the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence for the HA tag should be in the correct frame.

Wait, perhaps the issue
