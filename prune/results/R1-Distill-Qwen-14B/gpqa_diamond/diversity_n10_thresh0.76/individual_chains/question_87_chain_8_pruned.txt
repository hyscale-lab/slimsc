Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 more carbons. Wait, no, because substituents can be groups where each group contributes more than one carbon. Let me think again. If the benzene ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 more, the total is 8. So each substituent could be a single carbon, maybe a methyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a group with two carbons, and the other has none. No, wait, substituents usually have at least one carbon unless they are like halogens or nitro groups. 

Wait, but the question says the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, and another is a halogen, like Cl or Br.

Wait, but how many carbons do these substituents contribute? Let's see. A carbonyl group is an =O, but that doesn't add a carbon. Wait no, the substituent would be something like a carbonyl-containing group attached to the ring. Like a ketone, which is a C=O group. But that would imply that the group is, for example, a propanone group attached as a substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyl group, but that's more like a larger substituent.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituents are each a single atom. Like, one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is a carbonyl group attached somehow
