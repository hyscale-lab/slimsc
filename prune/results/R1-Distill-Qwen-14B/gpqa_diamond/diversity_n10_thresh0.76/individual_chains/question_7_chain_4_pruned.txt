Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about high-energy gamma-rays and their annihilation with CMB photons. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by this process. I remember that this has something to do with the interaction rate of gamma-rays with the CMB.

Wait, the process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. So, the gamma-rays are interacting with the CMB photons. I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray becomes comparable to the size of the universe, which would limit their lifetime.

I recall that the cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the gamma-rays and the CMB photons. The cross-section usually has a certain energy dependence. Oh right, the cross-section for two-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is approximately σ ~ (α²/(4E²)) * (something), where α is the fine-structure constant and E is the energy of the photon. But wait, I might be mixing up the exact form. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for γγ → e+e- scales as σ ∝ 1/E², where E is the energy of the gamma-ray.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The cross-section for this process at high energies is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but in the high-energy limit, it approaches the Thomson cross-section multiplied by some factors. No, wait, that's for Compton scattering. For photon-photon interactions, especially at high energies, the cross-section increases with energy because the photon can produce electron-positron pairs if it has enough energy. Oh, right! The cross-section for pair production (γγ → e+e-) increases as the square of the logarithm of the energy, or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's proportional to (ln(E))^2 or something else. Alternatively, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is proportional to (α²/(4E²)) * ln(E) or similar. Hmm, not quite sure about the exact dependence.

But perhaps I should approach this using the concept of the interaction length. The mean free path λ is given by
