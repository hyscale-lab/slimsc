Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll look at the data given. The IR shows medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because amines or amides typically show peaks in that region. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Because the IR has peaks around 3325 and 3420, which are broad, maybe it's an amide. Or maybe it's an alcohol or amine. But since there's a carbonyl, it's more likely an amide or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data, let's break it down:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably from an ethyl group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. So maybe an ethoxy group or an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet with two protons. Hmm, that's tricky. A broad peak might indicate exchange with something, like an amine (NH2) or maybe an OCH2 group in an ester? But wait, the formula has N, so maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen or nitrogen.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. For ethyl groups, a quartet is usually the next set of protons. So if the 1.20 ppm is the CH2CH3, then the 4.5 could be the CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen. So perhaps an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. Then, the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you get two sets of doublets, each integrating to two protons. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para position, or maybe one substituent that's a di-substituted group.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring probably has two substituents in the para positions. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2.

Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is one ring or double bond. For C9H11NO2, the formula can be rewritten as C9H11O2N. 

The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -
