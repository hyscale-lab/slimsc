Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on step by step. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A and ending with compound D. The goal is to identify what D is, with four options provided.

Starting with compound A: its proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, okay, NMR signals tell us about the structure. Let me think about what kind of compounds would give these signals.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is likely from two equivalent methyl groups (each with 3H) next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. So if each methyl is adjacent to a CH2, like in a diethyl group or something similar. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: a triplet implies each H in the CH2 is coupling with two adjacent Hs. Alternatively, maybe each of the two methyl groups is adjacent to a CH2 group that's split into a quartet. Wait, no, the first peak is the triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is the CH3 groups. So, for a triplet in the CH3, that implies each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. Wait, but if the CH3 is next to a CH2 that has two Hs, then each H in CH3 would couple with two Hs in the CH2, leading to a triplet. So that makes sense. So the structure might be something like (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, the quartet comes from the CH2 group. Because a quartet (which is a doublet of triplets?) No, wait, let me think about splitting. A quartet arises when a proton is next to a CH2 group that has two Hs. Because each H in the CH2 would split into a triplet, but if the CH2 is itself next to another CH2, it might be more complex. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a quartet. Hmm, perhaps the structure is something like diethyl ether? No, because that would have different NMR signals. Or maybe it's an
