Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about planets transiting and occultation events, so I remember that transit events happen when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, right?

So, the setup is there's a star similar to the Sun, but a bit bigger—1.5 times the Sun's radius. There's a first planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2. Impact parameter, I think, is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the star's center during transit. So if it's 0.2, that's less than the star's radius, meaning the planet does transit.

The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet. This one is bigger—2.5 Earth radii. It's also in a circular orbit, same orbital plane. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have and still exhibit both transit and occultation events.

Wait, both transit and occultation. So for a planet to transit, its orbit needs to be aligned such that it passes in front of the star. For occultation, it should pass behind the star. So the orbital plane is the same, which they already state. But the key is probably about the orbital distance. Because if the second planet is too far out, maybe the alignment doesn't allow for both events.

But how do period and size relate here? I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (but since it's circular, it's the same as the radius). The formula is P² = (4π² / G(M+m)) * a³. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M as the star's mass. So P² ∝ a³.

But wait, the periods of the two planets are different. Let's call the first planet P1 (3 days) and the second planet P2 (which we need to find). So their semi-major axes a1 and a2 would be related by (a1/a2)^3 = (P1/P2)^2.

But how does the transit and occultation come into play? Oh, right. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough, but since both planets share the same orbital plane, the second planet's orbital distance must be such that it can also transit, but also that it's close enough that when it's behind the star, we can observe the occultation.

Wait, occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star. But if the planet is too far, maybe it doesn't pass behind the star from our point of view. Wait, no, because for that, the orbital inclination must allow the planet to be on the opposite side of the star. Hmm, perhaps the main constraint is that the orbital distance of the second planet must be such that its orbital period is not so much longer that it doesn't line up for both events. Or maybe the other way around—so that during the orbit, the planet can pass both in front and behind.

Wait, maybe it's more about the relative positions
