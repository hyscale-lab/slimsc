Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The problem states that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c times S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The matrix S's first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. 

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Right, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. So first, let's write down the matrix A_y. 

Since A_y = c * S, and c is h/(4π), let's compute it. The matrix S is:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

So multiplying by c, A_y would be:
[0   -i*(h/(4π))]
[i*(h/(4π))   0]

To find the eigenvalues λ, we set up the equation (A_y - λ I) = 0. The matrix becomes:
[-λ    (-i h/(4π))]
[ (i h/(4π))   -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].
So determinant = λ² - [ ( -i² (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].
Wait, because (-i)*(i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the term is [ (i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]? Wait, no, the product is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) )? Let me think: the top right element is -i h/(4π), and the bottom left is i h/(4π). So when we multiply these two terms, it's (-i)(i) multiplied by (h^2)/(16 π²). 

So (-i)(i) is - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1 * (h²)/(16 π²). So the determinant is λ² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

Solving for λ, λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues could have an imaginary component? Or no, because S is a Hermitian matrix multiplied by some factor. Wait, wait, S is given as:

S = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Is S Hermitian? Let's check. The Hermitian conjugate of S would be the conjugate transpose. So S† would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]. Which is the same as S, since S's elements are 0, -i, i, 0. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, since c is a real constant, A_y is Hermitian (because c*S is Hermitian when S is). So the eigenvalues of A_y should be real. 

Wait, but when I computed determinant, I got λ² = (h^2)/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So any option that mentions imaginary parts in eigenvalues must be incorrect. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ± something. Wait, no. Let's see option A: the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh or ± ... No, that can't be right because we just found the eigenvalues are purely real. So options where eigenvalues have imaginary parts are wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: says imaginary parts are ±2πh or ± ..., but that's impossible because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Again, this would imply complex eigenvalues, which can't be because A_y is Hermitian. So B is wrong.

So options C and D are left.

Option C: eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, in quantum mechanics, the square of the angular momentum operator (A²) commutes with each component (like A_x, A_y, A_z). So eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². But do they share eigenfunctions with Az? Well, [A_y, A_z] = iħ A_x (from angular momentum commutation relations). So A_y and A_z don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different unless the system is in a simultaneous eigenstate. But the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of Az. So the statement in option C says that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That makes sense because A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are the same. But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't generally the case. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. The matrix operator's basis functions are the eigenvectors. So eigenvectors form a basis for the operator, but I'm not sure what the option is saying. It says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's a bit unclear. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are indeed the basis functions of the operator. Because the operator is represented in that basis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So that seems correct. 

Wait, but wait. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct? Let me think again.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, this
