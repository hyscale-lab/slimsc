Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, let me think through this.

So, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping in the Sun's core. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton (pp) chain. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, right? Each produces different amounts of neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos.

PP-I is the dominant process, I think. It involves two protons fusing to deuterium, then another proton joining to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 combining to make helium-4. The neutrinos come from the beta decay in these steps. PP-II and PP-III are less significant but contribute to the total neutrino flux.

PP-III specifically... Oh wait, I think PP-III involves a different path. So, in the standard model, the main neutrino production comes from the two beta decays in the dominant pp-I branch. But when PP-III stops, what happens?

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So, if the neutrinos are produced in the core, and the pp-III stops, the neutrinos from that process would stop reaching Earth after 8.5 minutes. But wait, neutrinos are produced continuously, so if the process stops, the neutrinos from that branch would no longer be emitted after that time.

But neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so any change in the production would be felt here almost immediately. But the problem is about the flux now, so 8.5 minutes after the stop. So, any neutrinos from the pp-III branch would have stopped arriving here after that, but neutrinos from other processes are still coming.

The question asks about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, what's the energy distribution of neutrinos from the pp branches? I remember that the pp-I process produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV, and the higher-energy ones come from other processes, like the CNO cycle or maybe other branches.

Wait, the pp-III branch... Let me recall. The pp-III process leads to the production of a boron-8 nucleus. Boron-8 decays into two helium-4 nuclei, and in the process, emits eight neutrinos. But wait, those neutrinos are from the decay of the boron-8? Or are they emitted during the fusion steps?

Alternatively, during the pp-III branch, the neutrinos are produced when a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form boron-8, which then decays into two alphas and emits eight neutrinos. So the neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy? Or are they similar?

Wait, the neutrinos from the pp-I branch have lower energies because the beta decay in the first steps emits lower-energy electrons (beta particles). The pp-III branch, perhaps, emits higher-energy neutrinos. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, the
