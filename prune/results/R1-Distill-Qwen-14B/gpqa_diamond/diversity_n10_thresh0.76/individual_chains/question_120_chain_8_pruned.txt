Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax... right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star relative to more distant stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number density of stars per unit parallax. Stars are uniformly distributed, so their number density should depend on how the volume changes with distance. Wait, because the farther you look, the more volume there is, but the number of stars depends on that volume.

I think that the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance d would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell is 4πd² * thickness. So as d increases, the volume increases with d squared. But since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars per volume (number density) is constant. So the number of stars in that shell would be number density times 4πd² * thickness.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is 1/d, so as d increases, plx decreases. So if I have a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Let me express d in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, a small change in plx, dplx, would correspond to a change in d. Let's see, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the thickness in distance, dd, is inversely proportional to plx squared.

Wait, but the volume element (dV) in spherical shells is 4πd² dd. Substituting dd from earlier, dV = 4πd² (-1/plx²) dplx. Since plx is positive (as distance is positive), I can write dV = 4π (1/plx²)² (1/plx²) dplx? Wait, maybe I messed that up.

Wait, let's make it clearer. Let's
