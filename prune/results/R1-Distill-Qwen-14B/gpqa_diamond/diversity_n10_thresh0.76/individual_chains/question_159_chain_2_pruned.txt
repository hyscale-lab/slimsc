Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me try to think through this. So the question is about observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. I remember that quasars, being very bright and distant, are often used to study the universe's expansion and structure.

Wait, the main question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. They're giving me the parameters of a universe based on the Lambda-CDM model. The current Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density (Ωm) is 0.3, dark energy (ΩΛ) is 0.7, and the universe is flat. So I need to figure out the comoving distance for a quasar at a certain redshift, but how?

The peak at 790 nm in the near infrared. Oh, wait, that's in the rest frame of the quasar, right? Or is it observed? Because if it's the observed wavelength, then the rest wavelength might be shorter. Wait, no, wait. No, if the quasar is emitting light that's observed at 790 nm, but that's in the near infrared. Wait, but the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. So the peak is in the near infrared, and the flux is lower in the optical (shorter wavelengths). That makes me think about the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to absorption lines.

Wait, but maybe it's about the redshift. The peak could be in the rest frame near infrared, but we observe it in the optical. Or the opposite. Let's think: if the quasar emits light with a certain rest wavelength, and we observe it at a longer wavelength, it's because the universe is expanding, so the light is redshifted.

So the peak at 790 nm. Let's see, if in the rest frame it's in the optical, then the observed wavelength is longer, meaning redshifted. Alternatively, if the rest frame peak is in the near infrared, observed in a longer wavelength, but that would imply higher redshift. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The question is about the comoving distance, which depends on the redshift of the object. So I need to find a way to estimate the redshift of the quasar from the given spectral data.

The peak at 790 nm is dropping in flux at shorter wavelengths. Wait, so in the observed spectrum, the flux drops below 790 nm. That peak could be a certain emission line, perhaps the Lyman-alpha line, which is usually in the ultraviolet in the rest frame of the quasar. But if it's observed in the optical or near infrared, that would mean it's been redshifted.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame (far UV). If that line is observed at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, then the redshift z would be (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately
