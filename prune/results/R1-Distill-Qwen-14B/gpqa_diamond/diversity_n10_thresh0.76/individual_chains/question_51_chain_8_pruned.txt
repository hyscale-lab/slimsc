Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think about what I know regarding conductors, grounding, and potential energy.

Alright, so the setup is a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. The charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of this sphere. Wait, but since it's grounded, the sphere is connected to the Earth, which means any excess charge would go into the ground, right? Or wait, does grounding affect the induced charges on the sphere?

Wait, no. When you have a grounded conductor, any excess charge on the conductor can flow to the ground. But in this case, if the charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can't build up on the sphere; instead, the sphere will have charges that balance the external field, but the exact behavior depends on the situation.

Wait, actually, when you have a charge q outside a conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. The external charge induces a charge -q' on the near side and +q' on the far side, but wait, no, maybe that's for a different scenario. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of method of images. Because the conducting sphere can be considered as having an image charge inside it. Oh wait, wait, the method of images applies to finding the electric field due to a charge near a
