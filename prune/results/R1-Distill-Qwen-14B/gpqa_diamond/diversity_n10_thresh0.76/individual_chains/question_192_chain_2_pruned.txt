Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the main conductor. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely within the conductor, not touching its outer surface. 

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the main conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. I remember from my studies that when there's a charge inside a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange themselves. But in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged.

Wait, wait. The conductor is neutral, but then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor must have induced charges. There's a concept where a charge inside a conductor induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the sum of these induced charges must be zero.

So, putting +q inside the cavity should induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor, and then +q on the outer surface. Because the conductor was neutral, so the total charge remains zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges would redistribute. The outer surface's charge would distribute itself uniformly, I think, because the conductor is a sphere. Because of that, any external point would "see" the charge as if it's a point charge at the center. So the electric field outside the conductor would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

But wait, in this setup, the cavity isn't at the center. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the induced charges on the inner surface would not be uniformly distributed. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution would be affected.

So, the inner surface will have a charge of -q, but since the cavity is not at the center, the distribution isn't symmetric. But the outer surface, being a conductor, would have a uniform distribution because the outer surface is a sphere symmetric about the conductor's center. Wait, no, the conductor itself is a sphere, so regardless of the inner cavity's position, the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution. Because the conductor's electrons would move to cancel any internal fields. Hmm, but wait, the induced charges on the inner surface are not symmetric because the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge density varies, but the outer surface's charge is uniform.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, the charges on the outer surface would adjust to ensure that their distribution is uniform. Because any external influence (like an external charge) would cause the outer surface to rearrange, but in this case, the conductor is just neutral with an internal charge. So regardless of where the cavity is inside the conductor, the outer surface's charge would be uniformly distributed. Because the outer surface is a sphere, and for a spherical conductor, charges distribute uniformly regardless of internal asymmetries.

So, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the point P is outside, so the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within that Gaussian surface. The Gaussian surface here is a sphere of radius L, centered at the main conductor's center.

The total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface would be the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric field at point P would be the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor. So when applying Gauss's law, the flux through the Gaussian surface is E * 4πL² = Q
