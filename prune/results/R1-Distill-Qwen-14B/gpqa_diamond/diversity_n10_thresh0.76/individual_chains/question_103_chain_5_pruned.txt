Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me sketch its structure mentally. It's a phenyl group substituted at the 3 and 5 positions with bromo and nitro groups, respectively. And attached to that is an ethanone group (a ketone with a methyl group on the benzene ring, I think? Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the ring. So the ketone is at position 1, but wait, numbering starts where? Oh, wait, wait, in the naming, the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is on the benzene ring at position 1, and then the bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: a ketone (from ethan-1-one, which is an acetyl group), a bromine, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 3, and 5, respectively. So it's meta and para to each other?

Wait, wait, the numbering must be such that the substituents are on the benzene ring as follows: substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone (which is at position 1). So the ring has the ketone (position 1), bromo (position 3), and nitro (position 5). So they're all in the para and meta positions relative to each other.

So the problem is about the order of substituting groups on the benzene ring. The key here is the directing effects of each substituent. Because each substituent will direct incoming groups to specific positions.

So the synthesis starts with benzene. Then, through several reactions, we add substituents in the correct order so that each new substituent goes into the right position relative to the existing ones.

The substituents we're adding are: acetyl (from CH3COCl),
