Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this one is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider effects from Einstein's theory of relativity, like time dilation or maybe the relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

The question gives me a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, each with a different formula.

First, I'm thinking about the non-relativistic case. In that scenario, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², so setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is about a relativistic case, so that's probably not the answer. But I should check if any of the options reduce to this in the appropriate limit.

Relativistic mechanics usually involves using the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this case, the oscillator's energy comes from the spring potential and its kinetic energy.

Wait, or maybe I should think about the energy of the oscillator in terms of quantum mechanics? No, the question seems to be in a classical context, as it's about maximum speed.

In the relativistic scenario, the energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the spring's potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, the potential energy in the spring is still (1/2)kx², right? But when the mass is moving at high speeds, its kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv² but something else.

So the total energy E of the oscillator is (1/2)kA² (the maximum potential energy when x = A) plus the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0) where the speed is maximum. Wait, no. At maximum displacement,
