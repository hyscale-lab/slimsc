Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and emitted particles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN)=0. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, first, what's the initial state? It's 1S0. So according to the term symbol notation (2S+1)L(J), the 1S0 state must have S=0, L=0, and J=0. Because 2S+1 would be 1 for S=0, L is S, and J is 0. So yeah, initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is -1. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number, right? So the parity of the initial state (NN) must combine with the parity of X to give the parity of the final state (NN + X).

Wait, the parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. For a state with L=0 (since initial state is 1S0, L=0), the parity is (-1)^L, which is (-1)^0 = +1. So initial parity is +1.

After emitting X, the NN system and X must have a combined parity that equals the initial parity. Because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is a strong decay, since weâ€™re talking about nucleons and particles like pions, etc.). Hmm, but wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So parity must be conserved.

So the parity of the final state (NN') times the parity of X should equal the initial parity. So:

Parity_final_NN * Parity_X = Parity_initial_NN.

Parity_initial_NN is +1 (since L=0). So:

Parity_final_NN * (-1) = 1.

So Parity_final_NN must be -
