Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives some information about their brightness limits.

So, the key here is to figure out the apparent magnitudes of each star and see if they fall within both instruments' detectable ranges. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning it can see stars up to, but not including, 17 mag. HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so up to, but not including, 16 mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 to be seen by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it (since it's only up to 16), and if it's brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can't see it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 mag for HIRES." Wait, but brighter means lower magnitudes. So, if a star has V mag 17, ESPRESSO can't observe it because it's exactly at the limit. Same for HIRES at 16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The question says: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, a star with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V mag less than or equal to 16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its V mag must be ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is V mag 16, then HIRES can see it (since it's brighter than 16), and ESPRESSO can also see it (since 16 is less than 17). So the star must have apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the way the question is phrased is important. It says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, but in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So "brighter than 17" would mean V mag <17. Because a star with V=16 is brighter than one with V=17. So, the condition is that the apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's less than 16. So the star's apparent V must be less than 16 to be detected by both.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, "brighter than 17" means V <17. So ESPRESSO can detect down to V=17 (but not including, so V needs to be less than 17). Similarly, HIRES can detect stars with V <16.

Thus, for a star to be observed by both, it must have V <16. Because if V is, say, 16.5, then HIRES can't observe it (since it's brighter than 16). If V is 17, then ESPRESSO can't either. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO? No, no. Wait, the wording is: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed." So, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude) than 17, it can be observed. Wait, but that's not the usual way. Oh wait, perhaps it's the opposite. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So "brighter than 17" would mean magnitude less than 17. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it's within ESPRESSO's limit. So, to be observable by both, the star must have V mag less than 16, because that's the stricter limit.

So, the plan is to compute the apparent V magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (if applicable), and see which stars have apparent V mag ≤16.

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude M=15.5, distance d=10 pc. So apparent V mag is M + 5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) = 15.
