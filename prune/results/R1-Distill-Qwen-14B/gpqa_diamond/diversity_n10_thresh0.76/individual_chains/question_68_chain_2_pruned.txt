Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about spin-½ particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the setup is this: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The options are A to D, with different expressions involving gamma, B, and some square roots or divisions.

So, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin operator S. Here, mu is given as gamma * Sz. So mu_z equals gamma times S_z. The spin matrices for a spin-½ particle are S_x, S_y, S_z, each with eigenvalues ± ħ/2 times their respective unit matrices in the eigenbasis.

The particle is initially in a magnetic field along Z. So, the initial Hamiltonian would be proportional to Sz. Since the magnetic field is along Z, the system's energy levels are determined by the Sz component. The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z.

But then, the magnetic field is turned off along Z and turned on along Y. Wait, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term, which is -mu·B. So the Hamiltonian should be H = -gamma * B * S_y, right? Wait, wait. Because mu is gamma S, and the interaction energy is mu·B. Oh wait, no, the Zeeman energy is usually given as H = -mu·B. So if mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, then H = -gamma * B * S_y.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma B S · direction. Yeah, so in this case, the direction is Y, so H becomes proportional to S_y.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, because the field was along Z. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is spin-up along Z. Then, when the field switches to Y, the system's Hamiltonian changes, and the state will start evolving under this new H.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. Since mu_z is gamma * S_z, the average would be gamma times <S_z> over time. So we need to find how <S_z> oscillates over time, and hence find the frequency.

So the average value oscillates because the state is evolving under the new Hamiltonian, which has S_y. Hmm, I think this is a problem involving time evolution under a Hamiltonian that doesn't commute with S_z.

Wait, the time evolution of the state is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>. Since H is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z, the expectation value <S_z> will vary with time.

I think the key is to find the time dependence of <S_z> when the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's model this.

Let me denote H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency. Wait, what's the actual expression? H = -gamma B S_y. But when considering the time evolution, the exponential has H multiplied by time. So, H is proportional to S_y, and that's the generator of the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z> = |↑_z>, which is (1, 0) in the Sz basis. Let's write this as a state vector:

|↑_z> = [1; 0].

The Hamiltonian H is (gamma B) [0, -i; i, 0] (since S_y has matrix elements proportional to that). Wait, the spin matrices for Pauli matrices are (multiplied by ħ/2). So S_x = ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]], S_y = ħ/2 [[0,-i],[i,0]], S_z = ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So H = - gamma B S_y = - gamma B (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Wait, but actually, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, so H = - gamma S · B. If the B is along Y, then H = - gamma B S_y.

But in any case, the eigenvalues and the time evolution can be determined.

The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i
