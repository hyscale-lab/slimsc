Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through nucleophilic substitution. So the first reaction must be a substitution where the ketone group is replaced by a cyano group. But wait, waitâ€”wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. NaCN is a good nucleophile. So when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, I think it's a nucleophilic addition, but wait, for ketones to react with such reagents, what conditions are needed?

Wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! I remember that adding a nitrile to a ketone under specific conditions forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically involves adding a cyanide ion to the carbonyl group. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated.

But wait, the reagents would be something that provides the CN- and maybe an acid catalyst. Oh, right, because the addition of H+ (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN (which provides CN-) and A, which is probably an acid like H3O+ as a catalyst. That would make sense. So in the first step, A is H3O+.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, that's a cyanohydrin.
