Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure is a phenyl group attached to an acetone. The phenyl group has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. So, it's a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5, relative to the ketone group.

Wait, wait. Wait, when looking at phenyl groups, the numbering depends on where the substituents are. Oh wait, the ketone is attached directly to the benzene ring. So the ring has a ketone (which is a carbonyl group) attached. Let me think: the substituents are on the benzene ring, so the ketone is at position 1, but that's confusing because benzene is a ring. Oh wait, wait. Let me think of the structure again. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

So, the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene ring has a ketone group (so that's a substituent) and two other substituents: Br and nitro. The positions are 3 and 5 on the benzene ring, but relative to the ketone group. So, the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at position 3, and nitro at 5. Wait, no, because if the ketone is at position 1, then the positions are numbered such that the next substituents are at 3 and 5. But benzene is a six-membered ring, so maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring with the ketone (C=O) attached to carbon 1. Then, the substituents are at carbon 3 (Br) and carbon 5 (NO2). So that would place Br and NO2 opposite each other, since 3 and 5
