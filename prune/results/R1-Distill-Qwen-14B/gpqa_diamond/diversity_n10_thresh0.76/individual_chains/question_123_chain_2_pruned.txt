Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving relative to each other, time dilation from special relativity might come into play. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So, the situation is probably handled using classical mechanics, like Galilean transformations, unless the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me check the speed of light. I think it's about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is a fifth of that. Hmm, that's about 0.2c. Oh, so relativistic effects might be non-negligible here.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So it's just a straightforward kinematics problem in different frames. So perhaps I need to account for time dilation due to relativity.

Let me rephrase the problem. In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. The question is,
