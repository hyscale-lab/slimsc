Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. I remember that molecular symmetry groups, also known as point groups, describe the symmetry of a molecule. Common point groups include things like C2, which is a two-fold rotation, D4h which is dihedral with a horizontal mirror, and so on.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so 8 equivalents suggest that the stoichiometry might involve B being in a ratio of 8 to A. What's a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else, but sulfur is more solid. Alternatively, maybe a metal reacting with a diatomic gas? Wait, 8 equivalents could imply a formula like A(B)_8. So if A is a solid, maybe it's a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2. Oh wait, red product... Hmm, maybe sulfur? But let me think further.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So the stoichiometry here is 1 C to 2 D. And E is dangerous. I'm thinking maybe E is like a toxic gas, perhaps something like SO2 or another pollutant.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, and produces two acids. Strong and weak. So maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 or something else? Wait, but the production of two acids suggests that C is a compound that can release different acid components when hydrolyzed.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. So, for example, if C is a salt, like a metal sulfate, which upon hydrolysis gives the metal hydroxide (which might not fit because it's a strong acid though). Alternatively, maybe C is a compound containing both Cl and another anion. Let me think: if C is something like a chlorate or chlorite, which upon hydrolysis could give HClO and HCl, but that doesn't fit because HClO is a weak acid. Wait, but the problem says F is strong, G is weak. So maybe F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2SO3 (weak acid). Or maybe H2CO3, but that's weak. Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is something else. But wait, I'm not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are gases, so their reaction might produce something like HCl as a solvent? Wait, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Or maybe D is H2O? No, because B is a gas reacting with D. If B is Cl2, and D is H2O, then H would be HClO? Wait, but HClO is not a good solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That's possible.

Wait, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. But then D + B in 1:1 ratio would be H2O. So H is H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense.

Let me try to piece this together.
