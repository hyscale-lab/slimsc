Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and we're given the explicit form of the state as a column vector.

First, I think I need to recall what the uncertainty principle says. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z is another operator with eigenvectors as the basis. So, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is already expressed in the basis where P_z is diagonal.

Hmm, but the state is given in terms of the eigenbasis of P_z, so when you write the state in that basis, it's a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P_z. So, each component of the state vector corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, I think the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, the vector has three components, which probably correspond to the three eigenstates of P_z. So, the state is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, each basis vector |n⟩ corresponds to an eigenvalue. So, the state |ψ⟩ is expressed as a linear combination of |n⟩, where each |n⟩ is an eigenstate of P_z.

But for P_z, the eigenvalues would be the diagonal elements of its matrix. Looking at the matrix:

P_z is given as:
[ [ℏ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ℏ] ]

So, the diagonal elements are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So
