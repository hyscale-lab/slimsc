Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where n is an arbitrary unit vector, ε is an energy constant, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? And each of them is a 2x2 matrix. So when you take the dot product σ · n, that's like n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. So the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because each σ is 2x2.

Eigenvalues... So I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator σ · n are ±1/2 times some factor, but wait, wait. Let me think more carefully.

Each Pauli matrix, when multiplied by a component and summed, forms a matrix. The eigenvalues of such an operator, I think, are related to the expectation value in the spin direction. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are plus and minus some value.

Wait, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. But when you have σ · n, the expectation value would be in the direction of n, so the eigenvalues should be ± the magnitude of the operator. Wait, but the operator here is multiplied by ε.

Wait, let's consider the structure. The operator is H = ε (σ · n). Since σ · n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with the unit vector n. So σ · n is a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1, because each Pauli component squares to identity, and the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. But wait, the σ · n operator itself—if n is a unit vector, then σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because if we think of σ · n as a spin-1/2 operator in the direction of n, then the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, wait no, wait.

Wait, no, maybe not. Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -
