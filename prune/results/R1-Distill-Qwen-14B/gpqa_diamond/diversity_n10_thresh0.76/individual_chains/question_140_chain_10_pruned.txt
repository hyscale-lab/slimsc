Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I'll try to identify what each substance might be.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce W gas and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. I know that the melting point of ice is 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit above that. Maybe B is something like water or a similar compound?

Wait, what's 277 K in Celsius? Let me calculate: 277 - 273 = 4째C. So B melts around 4째C. Hmm, that's close to the melting point of water. But wait, water's melting point is 0째C, which is 273 K. Oh, 277 K is 4째C. So maybe B is something else. Could it be another substance like a different form of water, or maybe a different compound?

Let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce W, G. Then heating G gives B. So perhaps it's a double displacement reaction or something similar.

Let me consider possible reactions. For example, when metals react with acids, they produce hydrogen gas. So maybe Y is an acid, X is a metal, and W is hydrogen gas. That would make sense. If X is a metal reacting with an acid Y, producing H2 gas and a metal salt as precipitate. Wait, but why would the salt precipitate? Maybe Y is a solution, and the reaction produces an insoluble salt.

Wait, what about if Y is a nitrate solution? Or perhaps Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is a salt solution, and X is a metal that displaces something.

Wait, the gas W has a
