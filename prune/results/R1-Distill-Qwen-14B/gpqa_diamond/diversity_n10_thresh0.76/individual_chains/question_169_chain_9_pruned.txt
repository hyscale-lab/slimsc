Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that there's a decay process where two heavy nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's, emitting two lighter particles E and V each. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the E particles' spectrum changes in this variant.

Hmm, I remember that in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle (electron), the energy spectrum is continuous. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value of the decay. But when another particle is emitted, like an antineutrino, it doesn't affect the continuity of the electron spectrum because the neutrino is hard to detect but doesn't change the statistical distribution much. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in the original decay, E and V are emitted. So each E and V pair. In the variant, instead of two V, we have one M. Oh, wait, the original was 2E and 2V, and the variant is 2E and 1 M. No, wait the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So in the variant, it's 2E + M, but wait, the variant says it emits one M instead of 2V. So original is 2V, variant is 1 M.

Wait, no, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So each A decays into a B, each emitting an E and a V? No, wait, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So total of two E and two V particles are emitted.

In the variant, the same number of E particles are emitted but instead of two V, it emits one M. So 2E and 1M. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The question is about the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles in this variant compared to
