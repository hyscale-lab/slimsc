Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic ring compound. Let me try to break this down.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, meaning it has two substituents. And it's got 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, wait, the ring itself is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. So each substituent probably has one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other none? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. Each substituent is something attached to the ring. So if the ring has six carbons and the molecule has eight, the substituents contribute two carbons total. So each substituent could be a group with one carbon, like methyl or something else, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon. But wait, the substituents could also be other atoms, but considering the IR data, which includes a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, right! So the substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, so the substituents are -O-C=O (like a ketone) and a halogen, maybe like -Br or -Cl. Or maybe one is a carbonyl-containing group like an ester or something else, and the other is a halogen.

Let me think. The IR shows peaks for a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the ring are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen. So the two substituents would be, say, a carbonyl group and a halogen atom. Wait, but wait. Wait, the ring is aromatic, so the substituents could be, for example, -COCH3 and -Br. Or -COOH and -Cl? Hmm, but wait, let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. So for example, one substituent is a ketone (like a propanone group?), but
