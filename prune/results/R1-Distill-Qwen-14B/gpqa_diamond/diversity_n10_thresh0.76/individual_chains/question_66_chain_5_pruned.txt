Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry, but beyond that, I'm not too sure. Wait, the SM itself has certain symmetries. Oh right, the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So I think the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, right? Because if they didn't, the theory might not make sense as a low-energy effective theory. So symmetry 1 is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. The SM respects Poincare because it's a local theory. But wait, in SMEFT, when you write down the operators, do they all have to respect Poincare? Well, I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But Poincare involves more, like translation invariance. But in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields, which are already translation invariant. So I guess SMEFT does respect Poincare, but wait, the question is about what must be respected by all operators. So 2 is Poincare. If the theory already includes Poincare, then operators should respect it. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation, which is tied to translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, I think operators respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I thought that the SMEFT operators are built
