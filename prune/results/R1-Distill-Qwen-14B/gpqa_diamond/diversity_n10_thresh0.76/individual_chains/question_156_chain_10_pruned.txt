Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read the question carefully. 

The problem involves two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns.

Hmm, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions also include aqueous acid after that. Oh right, under acidic conditions, epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions.

Wait, so the first step is epoxidation. Let me think about the stereochemistry here. mCPBA is an electrophilic reagent, so it adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide. For (E)- and (Z)-isomers, how does the epoxidation proceed?

Wait, wait. mCPBA adds to the double bond in a stereospecific manner. So for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxidation will result in different epoxide structures. Let me think: in (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, the peracid's oxygen adds to each end, forming an epoxide. But the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, mCPBA adds in a way that the peracid group adds across the double bond, leading to the epoxide. For a trans (E) alkene, the addition of mCPBA would lead to a trans epoxide? Or is it the opposite? Let me clarify. Oh wait, no. mCPBA is a peracid, which is a good electrophile. The attack is from the same face because it's an electrocyclic addition. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the mechanism.

The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene is an electrocyclic opening, but wait, no, the epoxidation is a [2+2] addition? No, wait, no. Epoxidation is a concerted process with the peracid adding across the double bond. The peracid's oxygen is added to each end, leading to an epoxide. The configuration of the double bond (cis or trans) affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two methyl groups (assuming oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2 at each end, but wait oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but wait no, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but wait wait, no, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but wait that's not right. Let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but more accurately, it's CH2CH2CH
