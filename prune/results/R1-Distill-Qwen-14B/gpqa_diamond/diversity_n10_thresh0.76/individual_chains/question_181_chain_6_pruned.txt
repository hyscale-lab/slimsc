Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and the main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains. Oh wait, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping. Right, the pp chain has a few branches, right? I think the pp-I is the dominant one, then pp-II, and pp-III is a less significant branch. So if pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how each band's flux would be affected by stopping the pp-III branch.

Wait, pp-III produces neutrinos too. I think in the pp-III branch, a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form helium-4, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Or was that another process? Oh right, the pp-III reaction is p + He-3 → He-4 + e+ + ν_e. Oh wait, but the neutrinos from this are lower energy compared to other reactions. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced in the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces high-energy neutrinos because when two protons fuse, they form deuterium and emit a
