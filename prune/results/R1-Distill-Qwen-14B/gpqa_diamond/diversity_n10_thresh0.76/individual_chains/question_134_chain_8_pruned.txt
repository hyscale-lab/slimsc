Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acid and base solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the problem states that we mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given in different units, so I have to be careful with that.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, I suppose I have to calculate the actual amount based on the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting.

First, I need to find out the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, determine the limiting reactant because the one that runs out first will dictate how much reaction occurs.

Let me break it down. For each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (L). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

2. H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each mole gives 2 moles of H+.
   Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but when acid and base neutralize, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. Which is the limiting reagent here?

Oh, right, the OH- is the limiting reactant since it has fewer moles. So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react, and some H+ will be left unreacted.

But wait, when you neutralize, the H+ and OH- combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ and OH- produces one mole of water, releasing heat.

So the amount of water formed here is 0.2 mol. But wait, because the OH- is 0.2 mol, that's how much will react.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ reacting, right? Wait, no, the standard value is per mole of acid or base. Let me clarify.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's about -57 kJ (or sometimes it's per mole of acid, but in this case, since we're mixing different acids and a base, maybe we can only calculate based on the limiting reagent).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the total enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So
