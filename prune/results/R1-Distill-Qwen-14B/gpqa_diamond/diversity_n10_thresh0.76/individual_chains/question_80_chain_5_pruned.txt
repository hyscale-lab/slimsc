Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. The examples given are:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And I need to find what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how this algorithm works. Let me think. DNA sequences are made of nucleotides: A, T, C, G. So maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a number somehow.

Looking at the first example: AGG is 115. Let's break it down. AGG has three nucleotides: A, G, G. Maybe each letter is being converted to a number and then summed or multiplied.

Wait, what's the numerical value of each nucleotide? If A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4, but wait, that's one possibility. Let's test that.

AGG would be A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115. That's way higher than 9. So that can't be it.

Another thought: maybe each nucleotide is being treated as a base in a number system. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, and the entire string is a number in base 5. So let's try that.

First example: AGG. So in base 5, each position represents 5^2, 5^1, 5^0. So A is 1, G is 4, G is 4.

Calculating: 1*(5^2) +4*(5^1) +4*(5^0) = 1*25 +4*5 +4*1 = 25 +20 +4 =49. But the output is 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe it's not base 5. Or maybe each letter is
