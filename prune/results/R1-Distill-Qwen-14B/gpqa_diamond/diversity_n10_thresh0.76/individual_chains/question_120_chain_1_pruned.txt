Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in terms of parallax is something like distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds), right? So d = 1 / plx. Got that.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, I think this is related to how many stars you'd find in a certain range of parallax values. Let's break it down.

Stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the sky here. Uniform distribution probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space, so the same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere. So, if I'm looking at a certain volume of space, the number of stars depends on the volume.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes with parallax. So maybe I should think about it in terms of how many stars are within a specific parallax interval.

Let me visualize this. The parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. If I pick a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see, d = 1/plx, so the distance range would be from d to d + dd. But since d = 1/plx, then dd = -d(plx)^2 dplx? Or maybe I should relate the two.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. Since the number density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in this shell would be number density (n) multiplied by the volume: n * 4πd² dd.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So let's substitute d in terms of plx.

So, number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² dd, since the volume is 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, and dd in terms of dplx.

Wait, let me think about how dd relates to dplx. Since d = 1/plx, taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, the magnitude is what's important. So, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting d and dd into the number of stars expression:

Number of stars = n * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx.

Simplify that: n *4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm,
