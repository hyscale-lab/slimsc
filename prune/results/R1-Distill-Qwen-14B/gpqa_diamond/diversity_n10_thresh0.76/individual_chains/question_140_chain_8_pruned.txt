Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B is probably a solid at normal temperatures, but just above freezing.

Next, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with substance X contains two oxygen atoms. Also, substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what X and the other substances are.

Let me start by thinking about each part. The reaction between X and Y producing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So what gases fit that? Let's think about common gases. For example, H2O has 10 protons (sum of H and O) but neutrons would vary. Wait, no, the molecule's total protons and neutrons are equal. Let me think: maybe something like CO2? No, CO2 has 22 protons (12 from C, 16*2 from O) and the neutrons would be (12-6=6 C, 16 O has 8, so 6+8*2= 22). Wait, 6 (C's neutrons) + 8*2 (O's neutrons) = 6+16=22. So total protons: 12 (C) + 16*2 (O)=44. But W has same protons and neutrons. So 44 each? That doesn't fit. Maybe another gas.

Wait, what about CH4? That's methane. Protons: 6 (C) + 4(1) =10. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons, H has none. So 6. 10 (protons) vs 6 (neutrons) – no, not same. So that doesn't work.

How about NH3? Protons: 14 (N) +3(1)=17. Neutrons: N has 7, so 7. Not same. Not matching.

Wait, maybe a diatomic gas. Let's think about O2. Each O has 8 protons. O2 has 16 protons in total. Neutrons per O atom: 8, so two atoms would have 16. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh, that fits! Because O2 molecule has 16 protons (8 per O * 2) and 16 neutrons (8 per O *2). So gas W is O2.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule. So if
