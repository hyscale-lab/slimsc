Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to how much light a planet absorbs and how much it emits back. The formula, I think, is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, I'm not totally sure. Oh wait, no, maybe it's T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) multiplied by ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Or was that ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)? Yeah, I think so. Because the planet reflects some light, so the albedo comes into play. Higher albedo means it's brighter, so it would be colder.

The question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part might cancel out in the ratio. So I don't have to worry about that. So the ratio would depend on the semi-major axis of each planet, which in this case are their orbital distances from the star.

Wait, but how do I find the semi-major axes? The problem gives me the RV shifts and the transit method. Oh right, the transit method gives the radius of the planet and the orbital period, but wait, in this case, the question doesn't give the periods. Hmm. Wait, maybe I can get the masses from the RV method, but the RV method gives the mass of the planet, not the period. Or wait, no. Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh, but in the question, they're giving us the Doppler shifts for each planet.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line, and Planet2 causes a shift of up to 0.04 Å. Oh wait, so the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So each planet causes the star to move, and the RV method measures that.

The formula for the Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Oh, but wait, the shift given is in Angstroms. So delta_lambda is 0.03 Å for Planet1, and 0.04 for Planet2. The star's line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å.

So for Planet1, delta_lambda = 0.03 Å. So delta_v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Wait, but I think the formula is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda. So v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

So for Planet1, v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

But wait, what's the speed of light, c? Approximately 3e5 km/s. Let me compute these velocities.

Wait, but maybe I can just find the ratio of velocities, which will be (v1)/(v2) = (0.03)/(0.04) = 3/4 = 0.75.

Hmm, but why do I need the velocities? Because the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / (M_star * (1 + M_planet/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3 ) ) / (c * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and the planet masses are much smaller than the star, M_planet << M_star, so that 1 + M_planet/M_star ≈ 1. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P))^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, but we can rearrange this to find P, the orbital period.

Alternatively, another approach: the RV method gives us the mass function, which is (M^3 sin i) / ( (M + M_star)^2 ), but since M_planet << M_star, M + M_star ≈ M_star, so the mass function simplifies to (M^3 sin i) / (M_star^2). But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets are detected via RV. So each planet's mass is known and causes a certain RV shift. But how to find their semi-major axes.

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula for a planet's orbital period P is given by Kepler's law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4π^2). Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So:

a^3 = (G M_star) (P^2)/(4π^2)

But without knowing the periods, I'm stuck. Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes from the RV data.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3)

But since e=0 and sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on orbits, as transiting planets are), and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / ( c * M_star^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps rearranging for P:

K^3 = ( G M_planet sin i (2π/P) )^ (something) )

Wait, perhaps I can write it as:

K = ( (v) ) = (2π a sin i )/(P c) ) * ( (G M_star )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) ) )

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to look for a ratio approach. Because the question is asking about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which depend on the semi-major axes. So maybe I can find a1/a2 from the given RV shifts.

Wait, the RV shift is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) )

But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, for a given star, the RV semi-amplitude K is directly related to (M_planet sin i) / ( ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (2π/(P * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (2 π )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Again, e=0 and sin i≈1, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_planet )^(1/3) (2π )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P )^(1/3) ) ) )

Which simplifies to:

K ≈ ( G M_planet (2 π) )^(1/3) ) / ( c M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Maybe I can just find the ratio of K1 to K2.

Given K1 = 0.03 Å and K2 = 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = (0.04 / 0.03) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

But how to relate K to the semi-major axis a.

Wait, another way. The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital speed of the star around the barycenter. So K = (v_star) = ( (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet) ) ) * v_planet.

But since M_planet << M_star, this becomes approximately v_star ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet.

But v_planet is the orbital speed of the planet, which is (2π a ) / P.

So K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * (2 π a / P ) 

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G (M_star + M_planet) )

Again, M_planet << M_star, so P^2 ≈ (4 π² a³ )/( G M_star )

So P ≈ ( (4 π² a³ )/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting P into the K equation:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * (2 π a ) / [ ( (4 π² a³ / G M_star ) )^(1/2 ) ) ]

Simplifying the denominator: (4 π² a³ / G M_star )^(1/2 ) ) = sqrt(4 π² a³/( G M_star )) ) = (2 π ) * (a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_star )

So substituting back:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * (2 π a ) / [ (2 π a^(3/2) ) / sqrt( G M_star ) ) ]

Simplify this:

The 2 π cancels out. So:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * a / [ a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M_star ) ) ]

Which is:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * [ a * sqrt( G M_star ) ) / a^(3/2) ) ]

Simplify the a terms: a / a^(3/2) = a^(-1/2) = 1/ sqrt(a)

So:

K ≈ (M_planet / M_star) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(a )

Which is:

K ≈ M_planet * sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star ) * sqrt(a) )

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I can write this as:

K = ( M_planet / ( M_star^(3/2) ) ) * sqrt( G ) / sqrt(a )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can express a in terms of K.

Let me rearrange the equation:

K = ( M_planet / ( M_star ) ) * ( 2 π a / P )

Wait, but from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_star )

So P = (4 π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So 1/P = sqrt( G M_star )/( 2 π a³ )^(1/2 )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I can find the ratio of a1 to a2.

Wait, let's express K in terms of a.

From earlier steps, perhaps K is proportional to ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

Wait, if K is proportional to M_planet/( sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a) ), then:

K1/K2 = (M1 / sqrt(M_star) sqrt(a1)) ) / ( M2 / sqrt(M_star) sqrt(a2) ) )

Simplify: K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt(a2/a1 )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 ) )

We can solve for a2/a1.

But wait, we have K1 and K2, M1 and M2.

Given:

M1 = 7 Earth masses,

M2 =5 Earth masses.

K1 =0.03 Å,

K2 =0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 3/4 ≈ 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357

So,

a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (225/784) ≈ 0.287

So a1/a2 = 784/225 ≈ 3.484

Wait, that seems a big ratio. Hmm, but let's proceed.

So the semi-major axis of planet1 is about 3.484 times that of planet2.

Wait, but the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

Because the star's flux at distance a is proportional to (L_star)/(4 π a² ), and L_star is proportional to R_star² T_star^4.

So, the equilibrium temperature is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) )

So, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So, the ratio of T1 to T2 is sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) * ( T_star cancels )

Wait, because T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) ) )

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because:

sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From earlier, a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, so sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So, T1 is about 0.536 times T2.

So, the ratio of T1 to T2 is approximately 0.536, which is close to option C) ~0.53.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

So, T1 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a1) )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a2) )

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Yes.

Earlier, we found a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So, sqrt(0.287) = approximately 0.536.

So, T1 is about 0.536 times T2.

So the ratio T1/T2 is ~0.536, which is approximately 0.53. So the answer would be option C.

Another way, let's calculate it numerically.

a2/a1 = ( (K1 * M2 )^2 ) / ( (K2 * M1 )^2 )

Wait, because from the ratio earlier:

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We can solve for sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (K1/K2) * (M2/M1 )

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (0.03/0.04) * (5/7 ) = (3/4) * (5/7 ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357.

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

Thus, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Then, T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T1 is T_eq at a1, T2 at a2.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So yes, 0.53 is the closest option, option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{eq}}\) depends on the semi-major axis \(a\) of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star, \(T_{\text{star}}\) and \(R_{\text{star}}\) are constant, so the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_{\text{planet}}\), the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\), and the orbital period \(P\). Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) can be expressed as:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_{\text{star}} P^2}{4\pi^2}
\]

For circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{M_{\text{star}} a}}
\]

From the given data:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet1 (\(M_1 = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}\)),
- \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\) for Planet2 (\(M_2 = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)),

we calculate the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{M_{\text{star}} a}}\), the ratio of \(K_1\) to \(K_2\) gives:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7\) and \(M_2 = 5\):

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 5}{7} = \frac{3.75}{7} \approx 0.5357
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is approximately \(a_1 \approx 3.48 \, a_2\).

Finally, substituting into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to a ratio of approximately 0.53. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
