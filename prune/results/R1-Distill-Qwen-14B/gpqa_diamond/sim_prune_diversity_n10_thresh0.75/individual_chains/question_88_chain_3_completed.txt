Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. So, they tagged these proteins with GFP and gave them to mice via oral gavage. Then they used in vivo imaging and observed two things: some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. When they sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability.

Hmm, the question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Alright, let me break this down. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably part of the viral structure, maybe important for infecting cells or triggering immune responses.

In the experiment, they're giving the mice these proteins tagged with GFP. When they do this, some of the GFP is destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is HCl, which can break down proteins. So the proteins might not survive the acidic environment, but some presumably do because they managed to reach the Peyer's patches.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized areas where the immune system samples the intestinal contents for pathogens. So the GFP-tagged proteins must have reached the Peyer's patches, which means they escaped the stomach's acidity and the mucus. 

Once there, the cells in the Peyer's patches probably presented these antigens. The next part is about isolating the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are often B cells that are activated and dividing. So these B cells are likely responding to the rotavirus capsid proteins.

When they sequence the variable heavy chain genes, they see high variability. High variability in the variable regions of antibodies is a key feature of the immune response, allowing for a diverse array of antibodies to target different antigens.

Now, thinking about the processes. The options are about different immune mechanisms.

Option D, VDJ recombination, is the process that happens in the generation of B cell receptor diversity during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow. VDJ refers to the combination of Variable, Diversity, and Joining gene segments. This process occurs during early B cell development, creating the initial diversity of B cell receptors. But in this scenario, the B cells are already mature and are being activated, so this might not be the case here.

Option C, class switching recombination, is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG, etc.), which happens after activation, usually in response to certain signals. This process affects the constant region of the antibody, not the variable regions. The question mentions variable heavy chain variability, which suggests something about the antigen-binding site, so class switching might not be the main process here.

Option B, complement activation, is part of the immune response where complement proteins are activated, leading to lysis of pathogens or opsonization. But this doesn't directly relate to the variability in the variable regions. So probably not B.

Option A, somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs in activated B cells during the generation of antibody diversity. Once B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo hypermutation in the variable regions of their B cell receptors. This leads to increased affinity for the antigen. This process is crucial for the immune system to produce high-affinity antibodies. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chains likely results from somatic hypermutation, as this process introduces mutations into the V regions, increasing diversity and affinity.

So putting it all together: the GFP-tagged proteins are taken up by the Peyer's patches, where B cells process and present them. The B cells then proliferate, and during this proliferation, they undergo somatic hypermutation, leading to a diverse set of variable heavy chains. This explains the high variability in the gene sequences they observed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while others escape to reach the Peyer's patches, where they are likely processed by the immune system. The isolated proliferating cell population from these patches shows high variability in their variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, consider the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D)** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in B cell receptors. This process does not apply here, as the B cells are already mature and activated.

- **Class switching recombination (C)** changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and affects the constant region, not the variable regions. Since the question focuses on variability in the variable heavy chains, this is unlikely.

- **Complement activation (B)** involves the activation of complement proteins, leading to pathogen lysis or opsonization. This process does not directly explain the observed variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains.

- **Somatic hypermutation (A)** occurs in activated B cells, introducing mutations into the variable regions of their B cell receptors. This process increases antibody diversity and affinity, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Given the context of activated B cells undergoing proliferation and the observed variability in the variable heavy chains, the most plausible explanation is **somatic hypermutation**.
