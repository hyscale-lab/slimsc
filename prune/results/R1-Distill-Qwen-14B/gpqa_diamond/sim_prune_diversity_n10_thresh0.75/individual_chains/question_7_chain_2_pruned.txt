Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this process. The reaction given is gamma gamma → e+ e-. 

Wait, right, the CMB has an average photon energy of 10^-3 eV. So, if a high-energy gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they produce an electron-positron pair. But how does this affect the gamma-ray's lifetime?

I remember that the lifetime is related to the probability of the interaction. If the interaction is probable enough, the gamma-ray can't travel very far before annihilating, thus its lifetime is limited. So, the key here is to find the energy where this interaction becomes significant.

I think the process is similar to photon-photon interactions, so maybe I should use the formula for the cross-section of this process. The cross-section σ is proportional to some power of the photon energies. From what I recall, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is proportional to (E_γ)^2 * (E_cm)^2, but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, the cross-section σ scales with (E_γ)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think it's proportional to (E_γ^2 * E_cm^2), but since E_cm is the center-of-mass energy, which would involve both photons. 

Wait, more accurately, the cross-section for γ + γ → e+ e- is given by the formula σ = (8 π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (1 + cos^2(theta)), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. But maybe for this problem, the exact formula isn't necessary, and we can think in terms of the threshold condition.

The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy is 2m_e c^2, which is about 1.022 MeV. But wait, wait, that's for each pair, so two electrons. So the minimum energy required is when the sum of the energies of the two photons is equal to 2m_e c². But in our case, the gamma-ray is high-energy and the CMB photon is low-energy. So the condition is when the sum of their energies is at least 2m_e c². But since the CMB photon is much lower energy, the gamma-ray's energy has to be on the same order as the threshold.

Wait, but wait, the CMB photon's energy is about 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than the electron mass (about 0.5 MeV). So for the gamma-ray of energy E to interact with a CMB photon (energy ε), the condition is E*ε ≈ (m_e c²)^2 because in the center-of-mass frame, the product E_γ * E_ε should be at least (m_e c²)^2. Oh right, that's similar to the condition for pair production by a photon in a nucleus, but in this case,
