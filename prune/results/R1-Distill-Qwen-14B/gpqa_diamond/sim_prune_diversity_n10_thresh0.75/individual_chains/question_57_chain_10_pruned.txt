Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role, especially when considering the imaginary part which relates to the cross-sections. Wait, the question says to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

The given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Oh, right, phase shifts are part of the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. Each partial wave is associated with a specific angular momentum l. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over these partial waves. 

The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) * ... Wait, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion more carefully. I think for each l, the amplitude has terms involving e^{iδ_l} and sin δ_l.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the sum of the partial waves' contributions. The imaginary part is particularly associated with the absorption part, like the optical theorem. But for the scattering amplitude itself, the imaginary part along the direction of the incident beam (θ=0) would involve specific terms.

Wait, let me think again. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written in terms of partial waves. The general expression is f = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ), summed over l. Right, so each term corresponds to a Legendre polynomial P_l, and the phase shift δ_l.

But since the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0°, because that's along the initial direction. So cosθ is 1. So each P_l(1) is 1, because P_l(1)=1 for all l. So the expression simplifies to f ≈ (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ), because P_l(1)=1.

Wait, but wait. The phase shift comes into play as e^{iδ_l} multiplied by sinδ_l. So for each term in
