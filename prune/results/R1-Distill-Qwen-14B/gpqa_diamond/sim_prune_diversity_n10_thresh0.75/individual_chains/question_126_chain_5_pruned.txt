Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. The task is to figure out how many peaks the chemist observes in each type of chromatogram.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

After both reactions are complete, the products are combined. Then they run them on a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC.

Hmm, I need to figure out the products of each reaction first.

Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone. When it's reduced, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a CHOH group. Wait, but the structure is 5-methoxy... So the starting material is a ketone with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure is something like:

O
||
C-OCH3
on the fifth carbon, and the ketone is on the third. Let me draw that mentally.

So, the molecule is: CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Hmm, wait: hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2(CH2)3-C(O)-CH3? Maybe not, let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, I might be getting mixed up. Let's count. Hexan-3-one would be 6 carbons with the ketone on C3.

So structure:

1   2   3   4   5   6
CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait no, that's pentan-3-one. Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is
