Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

Wait, wait. So, the Galaxy is one frame, and the ejecta is another. Since they're both inertial, we can use special relativity principles here, right? Because if both are inertial, the situation doesn't involve acceleration, just constant velocities.

The key here is probably the time dilation effect, because in different frames, time passes at different rates. But wait, I think I remember that time dilation occurs when you have relative motion between frames. So the time experienced in one frame isn't the same as in another if they're moving relative to each other.

In the problem, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s as well, because that's the relative speed. But wait, no. Wait, frames are such that if one sees the other moving at v,
