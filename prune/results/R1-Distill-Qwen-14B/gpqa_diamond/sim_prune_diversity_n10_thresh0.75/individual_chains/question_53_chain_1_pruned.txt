Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what information I have.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- group or something similar, but wait, no, esters are usually -O-CO-O-R, right? Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, no. No, esters are RCOOR', so the structure is R-C-O-O-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So, the ester group has the carbonyl (C=O) and the adjacent oxygen linked to an R group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data: six signals. Two aromatic H, two vinyl H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. Also, no signals for -CH2 groups.

Hmm. So, let me think about what this implies. The aromatic ring has two substituents. The substituents must be such that the aromatic protons are split into two signals. Wait, in a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents can be in various positions. For example, para, meta, or ortho.

But the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. That suggests that the ring is either para-substituted (with two substituents opposite each other) or perhaps each substituent is causing symmetry such that the equivalent H's are in two sets. Wait, in para substitution, if the substituents are identical, the ring would have two sets of aromatic H: the para positions are different, while the ortho and meta might be equivalent. Wait, no, if the substituents are the same and para, the ring has two equivalent sets of H: the two ortho to one substituent (but since they're across, maybe they are equivalent?), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different, so the ring isn't symmetric, but the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic H's are split into two signals.
