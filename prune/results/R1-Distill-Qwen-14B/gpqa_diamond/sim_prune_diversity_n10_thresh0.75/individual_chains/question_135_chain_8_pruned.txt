Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation here, but I think it's a Yukawa-like interaction. The boson X is interacting with fermions, and the coupling is mediated by the term involving X(y) and the fermion fields.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So we're to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing various fermion-antifermion pairs.

First, I remember that when a boson decays, the products must be able to be created from the available energy. In this case, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Also, since this is a boson (like a scalar), it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the fermions are matter and antimatter, and their masses can add up.

Wait, but each fermion species has a mass. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, say f and f-bar, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in the center-of-mass frame of X, the total energy is the mass of X. For the decay products, each fermion will have some kinetic energy, but the rest mass must be less than X's mass.

So the key here is to list all fermions where 2m_f <= m_X. Because each fermion has a rest mass, and the pair must sum to less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Fermions come in different types. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b), charged leptons (e, mu, tau), and neutrinos. But in this problem, maybe the X field interacts with all of them, but the decay depends on their individual masses.

So let's list the masses of known fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): around 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): around 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are very light, but for the sake of this problem, maybe their masses are negligible
