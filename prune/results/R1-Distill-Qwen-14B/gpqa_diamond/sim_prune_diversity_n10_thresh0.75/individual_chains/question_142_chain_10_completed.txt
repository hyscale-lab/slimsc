Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, this must be a mixed state because it's an ensemble of pure states.

Wait, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Oh right, I think when people talk about the geometry of qubits, they're often referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

But wait, what's the Bloch vector for a mixed state? For a density matrix, the Bloch vector r is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can rewrite the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write down the given ρ. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a projector, same for |1⟩⟨1|, so adding them and dividing by 2. Hmm.

Let me compute each component of r. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So the general form is (I + aσx + bσy + cσz)/2.

Wait, our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. The identity matrix is |0><0| + |1><1|, right? Because in two dimensions, the identity is the sum of the projectors onto the basis states. So, ρ is (I)/2 because (|0><0| + |1><1|) = I. Oh, so ρ = I/2.

So I can write ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. That means I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ. So r must be zero vector. Because any non-zero r would give a non-zero contribution.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state in the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. The given density matrix is ρ=(|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So it's a completely mixed state, which has zero Bloch vector. Yes. So the geometrical position is at the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general density matrix, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, with the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices.

The given density matrix simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

since \( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| = I \). Substituting this into the Bloch representation:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting \( I \) gives:

\[
0 = \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}.
\]

This implies that \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.**  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.**  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this is the origin of the Bloch sphere for the completely mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.**

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
