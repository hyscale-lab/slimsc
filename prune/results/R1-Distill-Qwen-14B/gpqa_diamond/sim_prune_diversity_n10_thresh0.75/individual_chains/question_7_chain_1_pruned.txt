Okay, so I've got this physics problem about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, which is super high energy.

Wait, I remember that when high-energy photons (like gamma-rays) interact with the CMB, they can annihilate each other. The process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. But for this to happen, the energy of the photon must be above a certain threshold. Oh right, because the CMB photons are low energy, so the gamma-ray has to have enough energy to pair produce when it interacts with them.

So the threshold condition for pair production from photon-photon collisions is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the rest mass of an electron. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV or 0.511 GeV. Oh wait, no, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 0.511 GeV is 511,000 eV. Wait, but for pair production, each photon needs to have enough energy, but since the two photons are colliding, their energies add up. So the condition is 2E_min = 2m_e c^2, but wait, no, because they're moving in opposite directions. So the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 2m_e c^2.

So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c^2, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta subtract. But for the threshold condition, the photons are moving head-on, so the momentum terms subtract. So the square would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 [since E = pc for photons], which would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2.

Let me compute that: (A)^2 - (B)^2 is (A-B)(A+B). So (E1+E2 + E1 - E2)(E1+E2 - (E1 - E2)) = (2E1)(2E2) ) = 4 E1 E2. So sqrt(s) is 2 sqrt(E1 E2). 

At threshold, sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2. So 2 sqrt(E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2 → sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

In this scenario, one of the photons is the CMB photon with energy E2 = 10^-3 eV. The other is the gamma-ray with energy E1 =
