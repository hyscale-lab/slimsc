Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from my high school classes. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options given are whether they'll die before reaching, or how many years they'll live.

Wait, wait. So the key here is time dilation, right? Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone stationary relative to the destination. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

I remember that time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity. The formula I think is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared. So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Let me write that down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)). 

The speed given is 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. That means the Lorentz factor will be very large, right? Because as v approaches c, gamma approaches infinity.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Let's compute v squared over c squared. So v is 0.99999987c, so v² is (0.99999987)^2 c². So v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that.

0.99999987 squared. Hmm, 0.99999987 is almost 1, so when I square it, it'll be a bit less than 1. Let me compute 1 minus this number. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to write it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it. Let me think: 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Squared, that would be (1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2). Since (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a². But a is so small, like 1.3e-7, so a squared is about 1.69e-14, which is negligible. So approximately, it's 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1 - 2.6e-7.

Wait, but the exact value might matter here because 0.99999987 is very close to c. So let's compute it more accurately. 

Wait, 0.99999987 is approximately 1 - 1.3e-7. So (0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2). So approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. Because (1.3e-7)^2 is 1.69e-14, which is way smaller and can be ignored. So (v^2)/(c^2) ≈ 0.99999974? Or wait, no. Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Wait, 0.99999987 multiplied by 0.99999987. Let me think: 1 times 1 is 1, but subtracting a little each time. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (0.99999987)^2:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 

= 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 

≈ 1 - 2.6e-7. Because the (1.3e-7)^2 term is negligible.

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7) = 2.6e-7.

So the denominator inside the sqrt becomes 2.6e-7. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is the square root of 2.6 x 10^-7.

Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.612, and the square root of 1e-7 is 1e-3.5, which is 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is about 5.09e-4.

Wait, wait: 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.16e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So gamma = 1 / (5.09
