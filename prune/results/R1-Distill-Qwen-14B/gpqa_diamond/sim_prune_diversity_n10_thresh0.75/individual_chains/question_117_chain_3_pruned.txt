Alright, let's tackle this question. Hmm, the question is about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Okay, optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where the mirror images of a compound are non-superimposable, causing them to rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, the compound must have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry that leads to enantiomers.

The question provides four compounds, and I need to figure out which of them exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, there needs to be a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Wait, the substituents are on the biphenyl rings. So, looking at the structure, there's a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' positions, each with a methyl ester, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Hmm, but wait, the substituents are symmetrical? Let me visualize. Oh, wait, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. But biphenyls can have meso forms or not. Wait, no, if the substituents are in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could lead to enantiomers. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality.

Wait, another approach: For biphenyls, the substituents could lead to cis or trans configurations, but is that a case of diastereomerism or not? Alternatively, the molecule might have a chiral axis or something. Alternatively, perhaps the positions are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl, so two ester groups on each ring. The rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So each ring is a phenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, the substituents at 2 and 2' are the ester groups, and the 6 and 6' are nitro groups. So each ring has a nitro group at 6, which is opposite to the ester group at
