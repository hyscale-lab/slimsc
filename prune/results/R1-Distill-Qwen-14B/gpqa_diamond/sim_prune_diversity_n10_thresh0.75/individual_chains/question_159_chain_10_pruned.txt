Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Hmm, I remember that in astronomy, the peak wavelength of a source can relate to its redshift. Oh wait, this is probably about the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to emission lines. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The options are various gigaparsecs. The universe parameters given are the Lambda-CDM model: Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density 0.3, dark energy 0.7, and it's flat. So I need to calculate or estimate the comoving distance at a certain redshift.

But how does the peak wavelength relate to redshift? Oh right, the peak wavelength observed is longer than the emitted one because of redshift. So if the peak is at 790 nm, perhaps this is around the Lyman-alpha line or some other emission line. Wait, what's the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha? I think it's about 121 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the redshift z would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that: 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So z is around 5.528. Wait, wait, but wait
