Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the state given is (3i, 4). Wait, wait. In quantum mechanics, spin states are represented as two-component vectors, right? So this is a two-dimensional vector, χ = [3i, 4]. But wait, is this written in a column format? Oh right, because spin states are column vectors. So χ is a column vector with components 3i and 4.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is the operator, and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So for S_y, the operator is S_y. But wait, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. For an electron, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices, right?

The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the spin operators are S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix.

Looking at the note provided, σ_y is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, which would make it:
[ [0, -iħ/2],
  [iħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So each element of σ_y is multiplied by ħ/2. So yes, the matrix for S_y is as above.

Now, to find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute χ† S_y χ, where χ is the state vector. Wait, but wait. Is χ a row vector or a column vector? Because the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector.

So let me write χ as a column vector:

χ = [3i; 4]. So χ† is [3i*, 4*], the conjugate transpose. So the first element is 3i*, which is -3i, because i's complex conjugate is -i.

Wait
