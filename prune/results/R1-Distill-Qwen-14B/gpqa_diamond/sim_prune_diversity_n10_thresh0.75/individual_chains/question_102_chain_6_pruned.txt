Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means it has two coding sequences (ORFs) in one vector, right? So the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by the receptor at the 3'. Each is fused to a fluorescent marker: the ligand to mCherry and the receptor to eGFP. 

Wait, but there's more to the setup. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so it should drive continuous expression of the ligand. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh right, that means mCherry is only expressed if the loxP sites are flanked and the stop cassette is excised. That's probably done by Cre recombinase.

The receptor is at the 3' position. It's under the control of an IRES regulatory element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, so they can drive translation without requiring a strong promoter once the mRNA is made. So the receptor's expression might be more dependent on the upstream promoters, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, and I think it's used with different Cre strains because it's sometimes used in a way that requires specific Cre variants to recombine. So the eGFP would only be expressed if the stop cassette is excised, probably by Cre.

So the construct is such that both the ligand and receptor are under the control of different regulatory elements and are separated by stop cassettes. But how does this affect expression?

The person then made mouse models homozygous for this construct in the wild-type background. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, perhaps. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal using antibodies. They expected a green signal, which would be from eGFP, but didn't see any. So something's wrong with the eGFP expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A says ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but the question is about whether the construct is expressed. Not sure how this affects the Western blot or the fluorescence.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in Golgi. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, but the Western blot might detect it. But the question says they did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, the Western is using the overexpressed proteins, so perhaps the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But why no eGFP in the mice?

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is strong, so maybe it's not relying on an enhancer. The IRES might not require enhancers either? Not sure. But if the enhancer was missing, perhaps both ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin. So the construct was expressed in the cells. That suggests that the promoters are working in the cell culture.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the stop cassettes are there. So the eGFP is under the control of the stop cassette. So, if the lox2272 site is not properly recombined, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't correctly spliced, leading to eGFP not being in frame.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand and receptor each with their own fluorescent markers. The setup is that the Cre is introduced to excise the stop cassettes. In this case, the parent mice are homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in neural crest-derived cells, which would recombine the lox sites.

Wait, the ligand is under C
