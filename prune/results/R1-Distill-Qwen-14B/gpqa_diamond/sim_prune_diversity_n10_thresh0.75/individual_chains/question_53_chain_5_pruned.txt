Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means the benzene ring has two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, right? So the compound has an ester functional group. Esters usually have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen connected to an R group. 

Looking at the NMR data: There are six signals. Let me break them down. Two signals for aromatic-H, which suggests that the two substituents on the benzene are in positions that make the aromatic protons split into two sets. Maybe para substitution? Because para would have two equivalent Hs ortho to each substituent, but wait, no, wait. Wait, di-substituted rings can be para, meta, or ortho. If it's para, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. So that explains the two aromatic signals. 

Then there are two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or in an aromatic ring. Wait, but the aromatic protons are already considered. Maybe the substituents have vinyl groups. So the substituents might be, for example, ester groups attached via a vinyl group. So perhaps something like an ester where the oxygen is connected to an alkyl chain with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR has one doublet and one doublet of quartets for the vinyl-H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets would mean coupling with two different sets of protons, perhaps. Or maybe it's a more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl groups are part of an ester substituent.

Then, two signals for -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2, which suggests that any methylene groups (CH2) are absent, so maybe all CH3 are either isolated or in a structure that doesn't produce a CH2.

So putting this together: The aromatic ring has two substituents, each of which is an ester group or part of an ester group. Wait, but the ester is one functional group. Oh wait, perhaps each substituent is an ester-linked group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group such
