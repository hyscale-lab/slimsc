Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the crystallographic planes and the lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystals... Oh right, they're a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter 'a' in a rhombohedral structure, right?

Wait, no, wait. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c. But in a primitive rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and all angles are the same, alpha, beta, gamma. So yeah, in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, so that's the lattice parameter a (or b and c since they're all same in rhombo).

The interplanar distance for a given plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. I think the formula is 1/d = sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² ) when the angles are 90 degrees, but rhombohedral has angles not necessarily 90 degrees. So maybe the formula is more complicated.

Wait, I've heard about the interplanar distance formula for cubic systems being 1/d² = (h
