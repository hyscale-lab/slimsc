Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. So, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. We need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. Right, I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian is usually proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Originally, the field was along +Z. So the initial Hamiltonian H1 would be proportional to Sz. But after the field is turned off and then on along Y, the new Hamiltonian H2 would be proportional to Sy.

Wait, but the particle's spin state is initially an eigenstate of Sz, since the field was along Z. Let me think: when the magnetic field is along Z, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz, so the time evolution is just a phase factor. But when the field suddenly changes to Y, the new Hamiltonian is different. So the state will no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and oscillations in observables.

So the problem is about finding the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz>, as a function of time after the change.

Let me recall how this works. The time evolution is determined by the new Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian is time-dependent (it suddenly changes at t=0), we can model this with time-dependent perturbation theory, but wait, maybe it's simpler because the system is spin-1/2 and the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can treat this as a transition between eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

The initial state was |up> along Z, which is |+z> state. But what are the eigenstates of Sy? The spin matrices for Sx, Sy, Sz are all proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the eigenstates of Sy would be superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

Wait, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, the initial state |+z> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Because the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, its eigenstates are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues determined by the magnetic field and gamma.

So let's write down the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian.

Let me denote |+y> and |-y> as the eigenstates. Then:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, actually, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), and |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2). So solving for |+z>:
