Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and uncertainty. Hmm, I remember that it's related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Let me think. The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is all about the relationship between position and momentum, right? The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're talking about minimum uncertainty, we can probably use the equality, so Δx * Δp = h/(4π).

So first, I should find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so p = m*v. But wait, since this is an uncertainty, Δp would be the uncertainty in that momentum, which is m times the uncertainty in velocity. But wait, actually, Δp can also be thought of in terms of the uncertainty in position and the velocity. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, let's think again. The uncertainty principle relates Δx and Δp. So, first calculate Δp. Then, since energy is related to momentum, perhaps I can find ΔE using the momentum-energy relationship.

Wait, the electron's speed is given as v = 2e8 m/s. But wait, that's a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 3
