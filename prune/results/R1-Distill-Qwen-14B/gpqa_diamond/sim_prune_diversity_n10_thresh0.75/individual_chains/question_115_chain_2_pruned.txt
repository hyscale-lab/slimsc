Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, there are two photons with the same energy but different directions. I need to find the angle between them.

First, let me parse the problem. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and it has a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right while the other is lower-right. The question is the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is the factor by which time and lengths dilate for an object moving at relativistic speeds. So gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for electrons and positrons, maybe I should calculate their energies or momenta.

Since they annihilate, their total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum and energy of the electron and positron must equal the combined momentum and energy of the two photons.

Let me think about the system before and after. Before annihilation, there's an electron moving left and a positron moving right? Wait, no—the problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, and the positron is moving from the right. So if I imagine a coordinate system where positive x is to the right, then the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left) and the positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). Wait, no, wait: the problem says the electron is moving from the left, so its direction would be along positive x. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is along negative x. Or wait, maybe not. Or maybe the problem states the electron is moving along the horizontal from the left, which would mean its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving along the horizontal from the right, so its velocity is to the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but when they collide, they annihilate. So that implies they meet at the same point. So the electron is moving right
