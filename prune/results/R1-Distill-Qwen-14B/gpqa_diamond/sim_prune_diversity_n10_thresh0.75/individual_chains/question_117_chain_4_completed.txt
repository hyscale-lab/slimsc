Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember optical isomerism has something to do with molecules being able to rotate plane-polarized light because they are chiral. Chiral molecules have a lack of an internal plane of symmetry and aren't superimposable on their mirror images. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show this kind of isomerism.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl structures can have different isomer possibilities. I think if the substituents are in certain positions, they can be chiral. In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, but the main chain is biphenyl, so the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' are also substituted with nitro groups. Wait, does that create a chiral center?

Wait, actually, I'm not sure. Biphenyls can have something called diastereomers if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetric. But for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry leading to non-superimposable mirror images. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the structure: each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point where the biphenyl connects. So, on each ring, positions 2 and 6 are opposite each other. Wait, but 2 and 6 are across the ring, but if the substituents are in those positions on both rings, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the nitro groups are on opposite sides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. The substituents are all on the benzene rings, but the central part is the biphenyl. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric, perhaps it's chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but if the two rings have substituents at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6', maybe that introduces asymmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should move on to the other options and come back.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be like CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. So the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) has four different groups attached: a methyl (CH3), a hydroxyl (OH), an acetate group (O-CO-OCH3?), wait no, wait. Wait, the structure is: the carboxylic acid is on the propanoate part. So the molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the one with the OH. So, what's attached to that carbon? Let's see: the groups on the central carbon would be:

- One CH3 (from the CH3 group)
- One OH (from the hydroxyl)
- Two carbons from the rest: Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CHOH. Wait, no, the propanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first CH2)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the carboxylate group)
- And another CH, which is connected to the next carbon.

Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO, but with the OH on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait again. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO^−, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon, so it's CH3-CHOH-COO^-.

Wait, so the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 group (from the first carbon)
2. OH group
3. COOCH3 group (from the third carbon)
4. And the hydrogen from the OH? No, wait, the central carbon is the second carbon, which is connected to:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 3: COOCH3
And two hydrogens? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the third carbon. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon has:

- One CH3 (from first carbon)
- One OH
- One COOCH3 (from third)
- And one H, perhaps.

Wait, wait, no. Each carbon in the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CHOH-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

So, the second carbon (CHOH) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3 (so a CH2 group, but wait, no, maybe it's CH2. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) has four substituents:

1. A methyl group (CH3-) from carbon 1.
2. A hydroxyl group (OH).
3. A carbonyl group connected to OCH3 (the COOCH3).
4. The adjacent carbon, which is connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of substituents. The central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. It's bonded to:

- The first carbon, which is CH3 (so CH2-)
- The third carbon, which is COOCH3 (so CH2-)
Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the OH is on the first CH2 group, which is the first carbon. Wait, no, the question says 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the OH is on carbon 2.

So the structure is: CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that's correct. So, the molecule is:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second C) has the groups:

- CH3 (from first C)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from third)
- And a hydrogen attached.

Wait, but how many substituents are different? Let's see: the central carbon has:

1. A methyl group (CH3)
2. A hydroxyl group (OH)
3. An acetyl group (COOCH3)
4. A hydrogen (H) from the OH? No, wait, the OH is a separate substituent. Wait, no, each bond is different.

Wait, each of the four substituents is attached to the central carbon. So, the four groups are:

- CH3 (from first carbon)
- OH (substituent)
- COOCH3 (from the carboxylate)
- And another CH, which is connected to the other side?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count the substituents again.

The central carbon (second C) in 2-hydroxypropanoate is attached to:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- A carbonyl group (O-C-OCH3) from the carboxylate
- And another CH2 group leading to the next carbon? Wait, no, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, let me think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In this case, the central C (second C) has:

1. CH3 (from first C)
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. The adjacent C, which is the third C (which is connected to O and another OCH3). Wait, but if the third C is part of the COOCH3 group, so the substituent is -COOCH3. So, what about the substituents on the central C: are they four different groups?

Yes, because:

- CH3 (different from OH)
- OH (different from CH3)
- COOCH3 (different from both)
- The fourth group is the adjacent CH2? Wait, no, the central C is attached to the first C (CH3), the third C (COOCH3), and two other substituents. Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central C is the middle one, attached to:

- CH3 (from first C)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from third C)
- And the other substituent is another CH2 group? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the central C is attached to:

- First C: CH3
- Second C: the OH is attached here
- Third C: COOCH3
- And another substituent, which would be the adjacent CH2? No, perhaps in this case, the substituents are:

Wait, no. Let's think about the actual bonding. The second carbon (the one with OH) is bonded to:

1. The first carbon (CH3)
2. The third carbon (COOCH3)
3. An OH group
4. And a hydrogen atom.

Wait, so four substituents:

- CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.

So, all four substituents are different. Therefore, the central C is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, meaning it can exhibit optical isomerism. So option 2 has optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings attached to a ketone group (C=O). So, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

Now, does benzophenone have any stereoisomerism? Well, for a molecule to have stereoisomers, it must have either a chiral center or some form of stereogenic element, like a double bond with E/Z isomerism. In benzophenone, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and another substituent. Wait, no— actually, benzophenone is (Ph)₂C=O. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl group is in the center, with two phenyl groups on either side. The central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to three substituents (two phenyl and one O). So, it doesn't have a chiral center. Any double bonds in the molecule? The carbonyl is a double bond, but that's between C and O. So, any possibility of E/Z isomerism elsewhere?

Wait, no. Because the carbonyl group is a double bond, but there's no possibility for E/Z isomerism in that case because it's between C and O, and both substituents are aryl groups. Wait, no, perhaps the double bond is between C and O, so it's a ketone. No, benzophenone doesn't have any double bonds that can lead to E/Z isomerism. So, no stereoisomerism here. Therefore, option 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond. The structure is CH₂=CH(COOH)₂. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

Now, this molecule has a double bond. The four substituents around the double bond are: COOCH3, COOCH3, CH₂, and CH₂? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between two CH2 groups, each attached to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, the structure is more accurately:

CH₂=CH–C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOCCH₂CH₂COOH, but with a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO₂CCH₂CH₂CO₂H, but with a double bond between the two middle carbons. So it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but the CH₂-CH₂ is actually CH₂=CH.

So, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂, making it HOOC-CH₂=CH-COOH.

Wait, no, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOCCH₂CH₂COOH but with the double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with double bond between the middle carbons. So, the correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (E)- or (Z)-butenedioic acid.

Ah yes, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → no, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again: butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond. So, the correct structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's HOOC-CH₂=CH-COOH.

Wait, so when esterified with methanol, the -OH groups become OMe. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH₂=CH(CO₂Me)₂.

So, the structure is:

CH₂=CH–C(O)OCH3.

Wait, no, each of the two carboxylic acid groups is esterified with methyl, so each becomes COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH–C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, the double bond is between the two CH₂ groups, but each CH₂ is attached to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH₂=CH–C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct structure of fumaric acid is E-butenedioic acid: the structure is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So it's HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → no, it's more accurately HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ carbons, making it HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → no, that can't be right because that would make it HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH, which has single bonds. So perhaps a better way to represent it is:

HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH → but with the middle CH₂–CH₂ as CH₂=CH.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H, but with the two central carbons being double-bonded: HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H → no, that would be succinic acid.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the structure of fumaric acid. Oh, right, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, with the structure HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂=CH-COOH. So, the structure is HOOC-CH₂=CH-COOH.

So, when esterified, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

So the structure is CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂.

Now, does this molecule exhibit E/Z isomerism? Well, the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are:

On each carbon of the double bond, you have one COOCH3 and one CH₂– (wait, no, the structure is CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, actually, the structure is CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂, which can be written as CH₂=CH–C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH₂CH₂(COOCH3)₂), but with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as:

the molecule is (CH₂CH₂(COOCH3)₂), but with a double bond between the two CH₂ carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH–C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try another approach. The molecule is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So each of the two CH₂ groups is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond (the CH₂ and the CH) has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH–COOCH3

No, that's not correct either. Wait, perhaps each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3 and another CH₂=CH–COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because it's a diester.

Wait, perhaps it's:

(CH₂COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–(COOCH3) but with a double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting stuck. Let me focus on the stereochemistry aspect.

Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond. The two substituents on each end of the double bond are:

Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH₂ group. Wait, perhaps each carbon is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH₂ group, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe each carbon has two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂. So each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on each double bond carbon are:

Left carbon: CH₂–, COOCH3.
Right carbon: CH–, COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has a methyl ester group. No, wait. Let's think about the double bond in dimethyl fumarate. The molecule has a central double bond, and on each end, a COOCH3 group.

So, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH₂=CH–COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

(CH₂COOCH3)–CH₂–CH₂–(COOCH3), but that's without a double bond. Alternatively, if it's a double bond, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

So, the two substituents on each of the double-bonded carbons are COOCH3 and another group. For the left carbon, it's CH₂– connected to the COOCH3 and the double bond. The right carbon is CH– connected to the COOCH3 and the double bond.

Wait, maybe each carbon in the double bond has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a CH₂ or CH group.

Hmm, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. No, that can't be because each has only one COOCH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)₂C=CH2.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. But regardless, the key point is that dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and the substituents on either side can lead to E/Z isomerism.

So, looking at the double bond: each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents. Let me see: for the left carbon, substituents are COOCH3 and CH2. For the right carbon, substituents are COOCH3 and CH.

Wait, but the substituents on each double bond carbon are COOCH3 and another group. So, if the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule can have E and Z isomerism.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH₂ or CH group. So, the substituents are arranged such that each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and another group.

Wait, perhaps the left carbon has two CH₂ groups and a COOCH3. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group on one side and a CH group on the other.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–(COOCH3)₂. So each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH₂ or CH group.

Wait, but in any case, the key is whether the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are different. If so, then the molecule can exhibit E/Z isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has two substituents: a COOCH3 group and another group (let's say, on one end CH₂ and on the other CH). So, if the substituents on each carbon are different, then the double bond can have E and Z configurations.

Wait, but if each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, for example, then the substituents are same on each carbon. Or perhaps not.

Wait, let's think: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-CH₂CH(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the ester would retain that configuration. Therefore, the double bond in dimethyl fumarate is in the E configuration.

But regardless, the point is whether the molecule can exhibit stereoisomerism due to the double bond.

Wait, another approach: a molecule with a double bond where each carbon has two different substituents can exhibit E/Z isomerism. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group (on one end) and a CH group (on the other end). Wait, but both ends aren't the same, so the substituents are different on each carbon.

Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents. So, the molecule can have E and Z isomerism. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would display stereoisomerism, which includes optical isomerism if there's a chiral center. But wait, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on each double bond carbon are different, then the molecule can have E and Z isomers. However, in terms of optical isomerism, E and Z isomerism isn't optical isomerism but geometric isomerism (stereoisomerism). Optical isomerism is about whether the molecule is chiral, leading to enantiomers.

Wait, so for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of chirality, like a planar chirality, which is rare. Alternatively, if the molecule has a double bond but with such substituents that one of the isomers is chiral, then perhaps it could lead to optical activity.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric in the E configuration. Because if the substituents on each end are the same, like each end has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group, then the E isomer might be symmetric, but the Z isomer would have both COOCH3 groups on the same side, leading to a chiral molecule?

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group on one side and a CH3 on the other. No, wait, perhaps each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH₂ group on one side, and another COOCH3 and a CH group on the other. Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, then the molecule would be symmetric, and perhaps not chiral. But if the substituents are different on each side, then maybe it's not symmetric.

Wait, but in reality, dimethyl fumarate has the structure (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. In the E configuration, the substituents (the COOCH3 groups) are opposite each other, leading to a symmetric structure. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, no. Because even if the substituents are opposite, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, in the E isomer, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical across the double bond. So, the molecule would not be chiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Another approach: if a molecule has a double bond with two identical substituents on each carbon, then it can have E and Z isomerism. But in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each carbon has two different substituents: for the CH2 end, substituents are COOCH3 and two H's perhaps, and for the other end, maybe CH and COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate is chiral.

If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. The E isomer of fumarate would have the COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So, E isomer is a meso compound, thus achiral. The Z isomer would have the COOCH3 groups on the same side, but in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry as well if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, no. Another thought: the Z isomer would have both COOCH3 groups on the same side, but in that configuration, the molecule might not be symmetrical because the substituents on each carbon might differ. Wait, but both substituents on each carbon are COOCH3 and something else. So perhaps each carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, making the Z isomer have both COOCH3 groups on the same side, but perhaps the molecule is still symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I should consider specific examples. For example, maleic anhydride is (Z)-butenedioic anhydride, which is chiral, whereas fumaric acid is (E) and is achiral. Wait, no, wait. Maleic anhydride is (Z), which is chiral, and fumaric acid is (E), which is meso and thus achiral.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, which is the diester of fumaric acid, which is the E isomer. So, if the E isomer is a meso compound, then it's achiral, and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. However, the Z isomer would be chiral, but dimethyl fumarate is the E isomer.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate is in the E configuration, which would make it a meso compound, hence achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the structure again. If the molecule is symmetric, like having a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For example, in the E configuration, the substituents on either end are mirror images, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, in the Z configuration, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but in any case, dimethyl fumarate is the E isomer. So, is the E isomer of dimethyl fumarate chiral?

Wait, no. Because the E isomer has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, which might give it a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information here. Another way: if a molecule has E/Z isomerism, it doesn't necessarily mean it has optical isomerism. For example, maleic acid has both E and Z isomers, and the Z isomer (fumaric acid) is a meso compound, which is achiral. Wait, no, wait: no, fumaric acid is the E isomer, which is meso, and maleic acid is the Z isomer, which is chiral.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me be precise.

Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, which is chiral. So, the Z isomer is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism, while the E isomer is achiral.

So, when fumaric acid is esterified to form dimethyl fumarate, it's the E isomer, which is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (E) is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So, option 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the E isomer, which is a meso compound. Therefore, when it's esterified, the E isomer (dimethyl fumarate) would retain that configuration and remain a meso compound, thus being achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Earlier, I was confused about this structure. Let me try to think again. The molecule is a biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2.

Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, with both esters being methyl.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester (COOCH3) at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.

In a biphenyl structure, the two phenyl rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents on the two rings are at 2 and 6 positions. Are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral?

Let me imagine this structure: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So, looking at the molecule, each ring's substituents are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but perhaps the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are across the ring from each other, does that create a plane of symmetry?

Wait, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. When looking from the central bond, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they mirror each other. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, when you have two rings connected in a biphenyl, with substituents at 2 and 6 on each, the arrangement might be such that the molecule is symmetrical, thus not chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the arrangement leads to a lack of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond, leading to a chiral molecule.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. In this structure, the central atom is the one connecting the two benzene rings. But that's a carbon (the central atom in biphenyl is C–C), so it's part of the rings. The substituents are on the rings, but there are no chiral centers in biphenyl structures unless the substituents are arranged in a way that a chiral center is formed elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry. If it does, then it's achiral.

I'm not very confident about this one. Another approach: aromatic compounds with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality. For example, binaphthyl compounds can have axial chirality when the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In the case of biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can exhibit axial chirality. So, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a lack of symmetry, the molecule can have a chiral axis, leading to optical isomerism.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Now, when the two rings are connected, the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring are arranged in a way that may or may not create symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the two rings each have substituents that are mirror images. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that when you rotate the molecule 180 degrees, the substituents swap places, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So, when you look at the molecule, the arrangement of substituents on each ring is the same, leading to a plane of symmetry. Thus, the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the actual arrangement. If the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', and each has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2, then substituents on each ring are at positions that are across from each other. So, when looking at the molecule, each ring has substituents that are para to each other, and the two rings are connected such that the substituents are aligned in a way that the molecule is symmetric.

For example, consider that each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So, if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the central C–C bond, the substituents would swap places, but the overall structure would remain the same. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, that would mean option 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, now let me summarize each option:

Option 1: No optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).
Option 2: Yes, has a chiral center, so optical isomerism.
Option 3: No, no chiral centers or stereogenic elements.
Option 4: No, the E isomer is a meso compound, thus achiral.

Wait, but earlier I thought option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) is the E isomer, which is a meso compound, hence achiral. So, doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only option that shows optical isomerism is option 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options provided:

The options are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → no
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → yes
3. benzophenone → no
4. dimethyl fumarate → no

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking at the choices given:

The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 1 and 4 which I think don't exhibit isomerism.
B) 3 and 4 → both no.
C) 2 and 3 → only 2 yes.
D) 1 and 2 → only 2 yes.

So, the correct answer would be option 2, which is only option 2. So, looking at the choices, which one includes only 2?

Looking at the options:

Option A includes 1,2,4 → no.

Option D is 1 and 2 → but 1 doesn't exhibit isomerism.

So, the correct answer must be option 2 only, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options:

The choices are:

A) 1,2,4 → 3 items, but only 2 is correct.

B) 3 and 4 → no.

C) 2 and 3 → only 2 is correct.

D) 1 and 2 → only 2 correct.

Wait, the question is "Which of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?" So, the correct answer includes only option 2.

Looking at the options, the only choice that includes 2 is options A and C and D. But none of the options include only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option 4.

Let me reassess option 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Earlier I thought it's the E isomer, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

But wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Another angle: does dimethyl fumarate have a double bond that allows for E/Z isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. So, the question is about optical isomerism, which is a subset of stereoisomerism caused by chirality.

So, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must be chiral. So, if the molecule is achiral, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (E) is a meso compound, thus achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options, the only option that includes 2 is options A, C, D.

But the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are incorrect.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 is incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is incorrect.

So, this suggests that the correct answer is only option 2, but none of the options have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, perhaps option 1 has optical isomerism. Let me think again about option 1.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

In option 1, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So, each ring has the substituents at positions 2 and 6. Now, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

When looking at the molecule, the arrangement of substituents on each ring might lead to a lack of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Each phenyl ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in positions that, when the rings are connected, create a chiral arrangement. For example, if looking from the top, the nitro groups are on the same side on each ring, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then which options include 1 and 2.

Looking at the options, option D includes 1 and 2.

So, if option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct answer would be D.

But I'm not confident about this. Another angle: biphenyl compounds with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule having axial chirality, meaning that the molecule has a chiral axis. Axial chirality occurs when there's a lack of a plane of symmetry along the axis connecting the two parts of the molecule.

In biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that flipping the molecule along the central axis doesn't result in the same molecule, then the molecule is chiral and exhibits axial chirality.

In option 1, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group at positions 2 and 6. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they don't mirror each other across the central axis, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, perhaps when the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that each has a nitro and a COOCH3 group at 2 and 6, which are para positions, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central C–C bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to the substituents being on the same side, creating a chiral axis.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should decide based on the options.

If option 1 does exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct answer would be option D (1 and 2).

But earlier, I thought option 1 is achiral. So, perhaps the correct answer is option 2 only, but none of the options have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the choices are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2

If option 1 is correct, then D is the answer. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is (E) configuration, which is a meso compound, thus achiral. So, option 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Therefore, only option 2 is correct. But looking at the options, the only choice that includes 2 is options A, C, D.

But none of the options include only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option 2, but the options don't have that. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate option 4.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

In the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. Does this create a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because if you look along the double bond, the substituents are mirror images. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.

Thus, option 4 is incorrect.

So, the only option that exhibits optical isomerism is option 2.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes option 2 is option D (1 and 2) and option A (1,2,4). But since I think option 1 is incorrect, the only correct choice would be option 2, but no option has it alone.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1.

Another approach: the molecule in option 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

Now, the biphenyl has two rings connected at C1 and C1'.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

So, when looking at the molecule, substituents on each ring are at positions that are across from each other. So, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central C–C bond, making it achiral.

Therefore, option 1 is achiral.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I was incorrect about option 4.

An alternative thought: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. If it's the E isomer, which is a meso compound, it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, the only correct one is option 2.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing option 4.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Let me think again.

In fumaric acid, which is the E isomer, the structure is (E)-HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, it's HOOC-CH₂=CH-COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

In this structure, the molecule is symmetric because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate (option 4) is achiral.

Thus, the only correct option is option 2.

But the options provided don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing option 1.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring in option 1 are arranged such that the molecule is chiral.

Alternative approach: the molecule in option 1 is 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate dimethyl.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

When looking at the molecule, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1'. The substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group in para positions.

So, in this arrangement, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central C–C bond, making it achiral. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

Thus, only option 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option 2, but I must choose from the given options.

Wait, the available options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Since I think only 2 is correct, but none of the options have that, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps option 4 is correct. Let me think again about whether dimethyl fumarate is chiral.

If the molecule is in the Z configuration, then it would be chiral, but if it's in the E configuration, it's a meso compound.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is the E isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate is the E isomer, which is a meso compound. Therefore, it's achiral.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the beginning.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider option 1. Could the substituents in option 1 lead to a chiral molecule?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

For example, if one ring has the nitro group on the same face as the COOCH3 on the other ring, but that would depend on their positions.

Another approach: the biphenyl can have two configurations: ortho and para. In this case, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para on each ring.

But when considering the overall structure, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the presence of two different substituents (nitro and COOCH3) at 2 and 6 positions on each ring leads to the molecule being chiral.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: if each ring has two different substituents (nitro and COOCH3) in positions that don't mirror each other across the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) or D (1,2).

But based on my analysis, only option 2 is correct. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of option 1.

Another possibility: option 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

In this arrangement, the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to a lack of a plane of symmetry. For example, if the nitro on one ring is on the same face as the COOCH3 on the other ring, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

I'm stuck. Based on the options, the only option that includes 2 is option D (1 and 2). But I'm not confident about option 1.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that option 2 is correct, and perhaps the answer is A, C, or D. But I think I'll have to go with option 2 being correct, and perhaps the answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should review the initial analysis.

The correct answer should include only option 2. Since none of the options have that, perhaps the correct answer is option 2 and 4, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is chiral.

Wait, let's think about the structure again. If the molecule is E, it's a meso compound. So, perhaps it's achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2. But the options don't include this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option 2, but the available options don't have it. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option 4.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl fumarate can have E and Z isomers. The Z isomer would be chiral, but the E isomer is not. So, if the question is about the ability to show optical isomerism, then the Z isomer can, but the E cannot. So, perhaps the question is about whether any of the given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism, regardless of their specific configuration.

In that case, option 4 is capable of exhibiting optical isomerism because the Z isomer is chiral.

So, if the question is about whether the compound can exhibit optical isomerism (i.e., if any of its possible isomers are chiral), then dimethyl fumarate (option 4) can, because the Z isomer is chiral.

But the question states: "Which of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?" So, it's about whether the compounds themselves are capable of exhibiting optical isomerism, regardless of their specific stereochemistry.

In that case, option 4 (dimethyl fumarate) can exhibit optical isomerism because it has a Z isomer that's chiral.

Similarly, option 1 might be capable of exhibiting optical isomerism if a certain configuration is present.

Wait, this complicates things. So, perhaps the correct answer includes options 2, 4, and 1 if they have the possibility of being chiral.

But I'm getting stuck. To conclude, based on the initial analysis, only option 2 definitely shows optical isomerism. But considering the possibility that option 4 can have a chiral isomer, perhaps option 4 is also correct.

But the question is about which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. So, if the specific compound is the E isomer of dimethyl fumarate, it's not chiral. But if the compound is the Z isomer, it is chiral.

So, the question is about the given compounds themselves, not their possible isomers. So, if the given compound is the E isomer, which is not chiral, then option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option D (1 and 2), assuming that option 1 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option 1 is correct.

But I'm not confident. Based on the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that option 2 is correct and that none of the options provided are correct. But since the options don't allow that, I'll have to choose the best possible option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not certain.

After much deliberation, I think the correct answer is option 2 only. However, since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option 2, but since the options don't include it, I'll have to choose the option that includes 2 and any others that might be correct.

But given the options, the only one including 2 is D and A.

But based on my analysis, only 2 is correct, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.

But I think I'll have to proceed with the conclusion that option 2 is correct and that the answer is not among the given options. But since that's not possible, I'll have to choose the best possible option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option 4.

Wait, perhaps I should look up dimethyl fumarate's optical isomerism. From what I recall, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleic acid is the Z isomer, which is chiral, and fumaric acid is the E isomer, which is not. So, dimethyl fumarate (E) is not optically active, but dimethyl maleate (Z) is.

Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct answer is option 2.

But again, the options don't have that. So, I'm stuck.

Given the time I've invested, I'll proceed to write the final answer as option 2, but the options don't have it. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should check the possible answers again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, which is correct, but 1 and 4 are incorrect.

B)3 and 4 → incorrect.

C)2 and 3 → only 2 correct.

D)1 and 2 → only 2 correct.

So, the correct answer must be option 2, but the options don't have it. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option 1. If option 1 is correct, then option D is the answer.

But I think the correct answer is option 2, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option 2, which is not present in the options, indicating a possible error in the question.

But given the options, the only possible choice that includes 2 is option D and option A and C and others.

But I'm not confident. So, I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option 2 only, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option 2, and the options provided are incorrect.

But the options must have a correct one. Re-evaluating, perhaps I made a mistake with option 1.

Upon further reflection, I think that option 1's substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral, thus exhibiting optical isomerism.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 1 and 2, which is option D.

So, I'll conclude that the answer is D.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule is chiral, meaning it lacks a plane of symmetry and has non-superimposable mirror images. Chirality can arise from a chiral center, axial chirality, or other forms of asymmetry.

### Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate  
This molecule consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 positions and carboxylate ester groups at the 2 positions on each benzene ring. The substituents are arranged symmetrically, with a plane of symmetry along the central C–C bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  
The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the second carbon) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carboxylate group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom. This creates a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

### Option 3: Benzophenone  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two phenyl groups are attached to a ketone. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not have four different substituents, nor does the molecule have any other form of chirality. Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Option 4: Dimethyl Fumarate  
Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂. Fumaric acid is the (E)-isomer, which is a meso compound and thus achiral. As a result, dimethyl fumarate (the E-isomer) is also achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. However, the (Z)-isomer of fumaric acid is chiral, but the question specifies dimethyl fumarate, which refers to the (E)-isomer.

### Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, only **Option 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other options are chiral. However, the provided answer choices do not include an option that lists only **Option 2**. Among the given choices, **Option D (1 and 2)** is the closest, assuming that Option 1 might exhibit chirality under specific conditions, despite the analysis suggesting otherwise.

Answer: D
