Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question is about six different benzene derivatives, and when they undergo bromination with excess Br2, we need to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. The options are given, and I need to figure out the order from least to most para-product.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine where the incoming bromine will attach. Electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) are meta directors, while electron-donating groups (like methyl or methoxy) are ortho/para directors. But wait, not all substituents are the same. Some are stronger directors than others.

Let me list out each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine attacks, it'll go to para more than meta. Wait, but wait—since it's an activating group, the ring is more reactive. So the substituent will direct the incoming bromine to ortho and para positions.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, wait no, no. Let me see: the substituent is -COOEt (where Et is ethyl). So it's an ester group, specifically a phenyl group attached to an ester. Wait, the substituent is actually a carbonyl group connected to an ethyl ester. So the group is an ester: -COOEt. Since esters are electron-withdrawing (because of the carbonyl), they are meta directors. Ester groups are deactivating, so they make the ring less reactive but still direct meta.

3) C6H5-Cl: So the substituent is a chlorine atom. Chlorine is an interesting case. It's an electron-withdrawing group due to its electronegativity, but it can donate electrons through resonance? Wait, no. Chlorine has a higher electronegativity, so it's a deactivating group. But wait, Cl is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing but can have resonance. Hmm wait, no. Wait, Cl is a meta director. Or is it? Let me think. No, wait: Cl is a deactivating group but is ortho/para directing. Because, although it's an electron-withdrawing group, the lone pairs can participate in resonance, making it more activating in certain positions. Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me clarify. 

Electron-withdrawing substituents are meta directors. But Cl is a deactivating group but can direct ortho and para because of its lone pairs. So Cl is an ortho/para director. So substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para directing.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's a nitro group (-NO2). Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the incoming Br will go to the meta position relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The substituent is an ethyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director. So the bromine will add more to ortho and para positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group because the carboxylic acid is electron-withdrawing. So the Br will add in the meta position.

Wait, but wait. I should think about each substituent's directing effect:

1: -CH3 → ortho/para director (activating)
2: -COOEt → meta director (
