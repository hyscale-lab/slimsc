Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. I think it's a hydrocarbon, maybe something like a bicyclic compound or a substituted alkene.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. That’s the energy needed to break a C-C bond into two separate carbon atoms, right? Or wait, actually, atomization energy is the energy required to break all bonds in a molecule to form gaseous atoms. Oh wait, no, maybe the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds in a molecule to form separate atoms. Oh, but the problem gives bond energies for different types of bonds. Hmm.

The problem states that the bond energies are as follows:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but these are the bond energies, which are the energies released when a bond is formed. To calculate the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to use the formula involving bond energies. The enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a molecule is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.

So, the general approach is: the enthalpy of formation of a molecule equals the sum of the bond energies of the bonds in the reactants (the elements) minus the sum of the bond energies in the products (the molecule). Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh wait, the formation enthalpy is the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its elements. So the calculation is based on the bonds broken in the reactants and formed in the products.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is: ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products). Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, no, bond energies are the energy released when bonds are formed. So when you form bonds in the product, you're releasing energy, which would be subtracted. When you break bonds in the reactants, you're absorbing energy, which would be added.

Wait, I think the formula is:

ΔHf°(molecule) = [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of all bonds in products)].

But wait, no. Because the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when the molecule is made from elements. So the elements are in their standard states, like H2 and O2, etc. But in this problem, the molecule is hydrocarbon, so it's made from carbon and hydrogen.

So for the reaction:
