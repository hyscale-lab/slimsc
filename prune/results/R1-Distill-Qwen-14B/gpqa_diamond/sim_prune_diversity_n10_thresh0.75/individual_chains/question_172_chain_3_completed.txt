Okay, so I've got this physics problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? I think it refers to the excitation states. So, the number of atoms in a higher energy level versus a lower one is different for each star.

Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I remember that the excitation of atoms in stars relates to the thermal energy of the photosphere, and that when in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)). Here, g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but in this problem, maybe we can assume the statistical weights are the same for both levels? Or does it matter?

Wait, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, the population in the higher energy level for star_1 is higher than that in star_2. Let me denote the populations.

Let's call n1 as the number of atoms in the higher energy level for star_1, and n2 as that for star_2. It says n1 = 2 * n2? Wait, actually, the question says "twice as excited", which probably means the excitation is higher, so the number of atoms in the excited state is higher. So the ratio n_high / n_low for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

But wait, the problem might be that the excitation is higher, so the ratio (n_high/n_low) is higher for star_1. So perhaps for each star, we can write their respective ratios.

So for star 1: n1_high / n1_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

Similarly, for star 2: n2_high / n2_low = (g_high/g_low) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

If the statistical weights are the same (g_high/g_low is the same for both stars), then the ratio of the two ratios would be:

(n1_high / n1_low) / (n2_high / n2_low) = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you take the ratio, the exponents subtract. Let me make sure:

Let me denote R1 = n1_high/n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) * (g_high/g_low)
Similarly R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) * (g_high/g_low )

So R1/R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no. Because when you divide R1 by R2, you have exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / exp( (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) * exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) )? Wait, maybe I should re-express it.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio R1/R2 is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But the problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So R1 is twice R2. So R1/R2 = 2.

So 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, no, wait. Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

Wait, let's compute that:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So putting it all together:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I think that value might actually be equal to k_B * T, where T is about 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J is k_B times 1 K, since k_B is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k_B * T, but wait, it's given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k_B * 1 K. So ΔE = k_B * T where T is 1 K.

So substituting ΔE = k_B * 1 K into the equation:

ln(2) = [ (k_B * 1 K) / k_B ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Simplify: 1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, that's the equation I have. So the correct equation is option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's exactly what I derived. So the answer should be D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), assuming LTE.

In LTE, the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{high}}}{n_{\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{high}} \) and \( g_{\text{low}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations in the excited and ground states are:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{high}}}{n_{1,\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{high}}}{n_{2,\text{low}}} = \frac{g_{\text{high}}}{g_{\text{low}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the ratio of these two equations:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1,\text{high}}}{n_{1,\text{low}}}}{\frac{n_{2,\text{high}}}{n_{2,\text{low}}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{high}}}{n_{1,\text{low}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{high}}}{n_{2,\text{low}}}.
\]

Thus:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot T \), where \( T \) is approximately 1 K (as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)), the equation reduces to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
