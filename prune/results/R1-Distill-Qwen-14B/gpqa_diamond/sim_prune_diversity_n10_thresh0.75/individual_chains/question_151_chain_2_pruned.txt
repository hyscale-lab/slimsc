Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value. 

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait, actually, that's the state vector, right? So it's a vector in the Hilbert space. The observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has specific elements in each row. 

The observable's matrix P is given as:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what this matrix represents. Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. So P should be a Hermitian matrix. Let me check if P is Hermitian. 

Wait, for a matrix to be Hermitian, the conjugate transpose should equal the original matrix. But in this case, all the elements are real, so the transpose should equal the original. Let me see. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], and the first column is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] as well. Second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the second column is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. The third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], third column is same as first. So yes, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. That makes sense because observables must be Hermitian.

Now, the question is about the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. So, I think I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then project the state vector onto those eigenvectors. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of these projections will give the probability.

Alternatively, wait, another approach might be to compute the expectation value. But no, that's not what the
