Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm.

Alright, let's break it down. The setup is a charge q located at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere with radius R. The sphere is grounded, which probably means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can go to the ground. Oh, wait, but since it's a conductor, the charges would redistribute on the surface.

Wait, I remember that when a charged object is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons from the ground. So, the sphere's induced charges would adjust to maintain an equipotential surface, considering the grounding.

But wait, the sphere's potential should be zero because it's grounded. So, the surface of the sphere is at zero potential. That affects the potential energy calculation.

Potential energy in a system of charges is usually calculated by finding the work done to bring the charges together. Here, we have the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be such that the potential on the surface is zero. But I'm not sure exactly how that plays into the potential energy.

Wait, I think that when you bring a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges create an image charge. Oh right! The method of images is used in electro
