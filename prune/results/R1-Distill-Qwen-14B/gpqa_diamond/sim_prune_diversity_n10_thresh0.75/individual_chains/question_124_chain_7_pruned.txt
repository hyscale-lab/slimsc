Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities and their ability to reach the inner walls of a detector. Hmm, right, I remember that Lorentz factors are involved here.

So the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Wait, I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Because if a particle decays, it won't reach the detector. So the distance they travel before decaying must be related to their velocity and the detector's size.

I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) of the particle is the average lifetime from its rest frame. But when observed from the lab frame, their lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The Lorentz factor gamma comes into play here. So the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Since they're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, let's denote v as beta*c, where beta is v/c. So the distance L would be beta*c * gamma * tau.

Let me write that down. L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

But wait, since gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), and beta is v/c, maybe there's a way to express everything in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau, so the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. The speed is v = beta c. So the average distance the particle travels is v * gamma tau = beta c gamma tau.

But the particle must reach the detector's wall, which is at radius R =30 meters. So when L is greater than R, the particle will reach the wall before decaying (assuming R is the maximum distance to the wall).

Wait no, the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance to the wall is 30 meters.

So the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether its lifetime allows it to travel that distance.

But how does this relate to the fraction of particles that reach the wall?

Wait, I think it's a matter of the particle's decay length. The decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau. So the probability that a particle with decay length L will reach the wall is the probability that it doesn't decay before traveling distance R.

So the probability P is the Heaviside step function, P = 1 if L >= R, else 0. But since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the survival probability (probability that the particle hasn't decayed after time t) is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the decay process. The particles have a lifetime tau in their rest frame. In the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma tau. The probability that a particle survives long enough to reach the detector wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

Time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c). So the survival probability is the probability that gamma tau >= t. Because the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The particle's lifetime in its rest frame is tau. The time experienced by the particle is tau when it decays, but from the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c). So to not decay before reaching the wall, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame must be greater than t. So gamma tau >= t.

So gamma tau >= R/(beta c)

Substituting beta as v/c, but beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)}.

Wait, let me express beta in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), then beta = sqrt
