Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits, causing the star to wobble. The amount of shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. So the stars are identical, which might simplify things because their masses are the same, so maybe the differences are due to the planets' orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but wait—how does that relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method depends on the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1)^(1/3)) ) ) Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some parts. Alternatively, the formula I remember is K = [ (2πG) / (c * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since the planets' eccentricities are zero (they're circular orbits), the (1 - e²) part is 1. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees for both because they're detected—so sin i is 1. Hmm, but wait, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, so their masses are similar. Let me think—since the stars are identical, M_star is the same for both. The planets have similar masses, so M_planet is the same for both.

Wait, but the question says the planets have masses similar to Neptune's, so I can assume M1 ≈ M2. So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me get the formula right. Radial velocity semi-amplitude K is
