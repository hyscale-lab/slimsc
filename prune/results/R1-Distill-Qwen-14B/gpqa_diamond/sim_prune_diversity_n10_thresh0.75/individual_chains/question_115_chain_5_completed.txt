Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm, okay. So, since they annihilate, I think I should consider conservation of energy and momentum here. Because in any closed system, these must be conserved. Since the photons are produced, their momenta must balance the total momentum of the electron and positron before the collision.

Wait, but the electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta might be in opposite directions. Let me think about this. The electron is moving left to right (from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (from the right). But wait, no, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, the electron is moving to the right, the positron is moving to the left. Oh wait, no, no: the electron is moving from the left, so it's moving to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so it's moving to the left. So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

But wait, I need to calculate their relativistic momenta. Lorentz factor is given. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). But for momentum, it's gamma * m * v. But wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, m_e.

So, for the electron moving to the right (let's say positive x-direction), its momentum p_e is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum p_p is gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but in the negative x-direction. So when I add their momenta, I need to consider the signs.

Wait, but what's the actual direction? Let me clarify. Electron is moving from left to right (positive x), positron from right to left (negative x direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis. So the positron is moving from the right along the same axis. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So, let's assign the electron's velocity as +v_e (to the right), and the positron's as -v_p (to the left). So their momenta would be in opposite directions.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's be precise. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, meaning its velocity is towards the right (positive x). The positron is moving from the right along the same axis, so its velocity is towards the left (negative x). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum will be the sum of their momenta, considering direction.

Wait, but when they annihilate, they produce photons. So I need to make sure that the total momentum after is zero? No, wait, because photons carry momentum. So the total momentum of the two photons must equal the total momentum of the electron and positron before annihilation.

Ah, right. So the initial total momentum is the sum of the two particles' momenta (considering direction), and the final total momentum is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

But wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Since energy of a photon is E = h f, and for relativistic particles, E = pc (since their mass is zero). So, the momentum p of each photon is E/c.

Wait, but wait: photons have energy E = pc, because their rest mass is zero. So each photon's momentum is E/c, and the direction is determined by their movement.

So, the two photons have the same energy, so their momenta have the same magnitude, but their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So, their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. That is, their angles from the x-axis are the same but in opposite vertical directions.

Wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So, both are moving towards the right (positive x) but in different vertical directions. So their momenta are vectors in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.

Wait a minute, but wait. If the initial momentum is in the x-direction, and the photons are moving in the right direction, that would mean their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants, which would make sense for conservation of momentum.

But wait, the initial momentum is a vector in the x-direction. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must also be in the x-direction. Because after annihilation, the photons' momenta add up to the initial system's momentum.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial total momentum of the electron and positron.

2. The sum of the two photons' momenta must equal this initial momentum.

3. Since both photons have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude, but their directions are symmetric about the x-axis (so their y-components cancel each other out if their angles are symmetric).

Wait, but wait. The sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum. So, let's denote the initial total momentum as P_initial = P_e + P_p (electron and positron momenta).

But the electron is moving to the right, and the positron to the left, so their momenta are in opposite directions. So P_initial = gamma_e * m_e * v_e (right) - gamma_p * m_e * v_p (left). Wait, because the positron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. So P_initial = (gamma_e * m_e v_e) - (gamma_p * m_e v_p).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs. Let me think again. The positron is moving in the opposite direction to the electron. So if the electron has a momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e (positive x), then the positron's momentum is p_p = - gamma_p m_e v_p (because it's moving left). So the total initial momentum is P_initial = p_e + p_p = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.

But wait, velocities are related to their Lorentz factors. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Alternatively, for each particle, I can find their velocity in terms of gamma.

So, let's compute the velocities. For the electron, gamma_e =4. So v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4) ≈ 0.968 c. Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2, so v_p = c * sqrt(1 -1/(2^2)) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈0.866 c.

Wait, but the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative: v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

But wait, for the positron, gamma is positive regardless of direction, right? Because Lorentz factor depends on speed, not direction.

So, for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e sqrt(15) c.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute p_e correctly. p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

But v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(1 -1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c * (sqrt(15)/4). So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * (c * sqrt(15)/4) )= (4 m_e c) * (sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, for the positron, moving to the left, so its velocity is - (sqrt(3)/2 c). Its gamma is 2, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 m_e * (- sqrt(3)/2 c) )= - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So the total initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = [m_e c sqrt(15)] + [ - m_e c sqrt(3) ].

Wait, that's because p_p is negative. Wait, no, wait: the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is - sqrt(3)/2 c. So when we calculate p_p, it's gamma_p * m_e * v_p. So gamma_p is 2, v_p is negative, so p_p is negative.

So P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, because sqrt(15) is about 3.87 and sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is about 2.138, so P_initial is positive, meaning it's to the right.

So the total initial momentum is P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Now, after annihilation, two photons are emitted. Each photon has energy E, so their momentum magnitudes are E/c each.

But since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c in the direction they're moving.

The problem states that both photons have the same energy, so their momenta have the same magnitude, p1 = p2 = E/c.

The directions are upper-right and lower-right. Let's assume that each photon makes an angle theta above and below the x-axis, respectively.

So, for photon 1, its momentum vector is (p_x, p_y) where p_x = p * cos(theta), p_y = p * sin(theta).

For photon 2, since it's in the lower-right direction, its momentum is (p * cos(theta), -p * sin(theta)).

Wait, but wait: the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis are theta and -theta, respectively.

So the sum of their momenta in the x-direction is p1x + p2x = 2 p cos(theta), and the sum in the y-direction is p1y + p2y = p sin(theta) - p sin(theta) = 0.

So the total momentum after annihilation is (2 p cos(theta), 0), where p = E/c.

But the initial total momentum is P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, the final momentum must equal the initial, so:

2 p cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But p = E/c. So substituting:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

We can solve for cos(theta):

cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) * c ] / (2 E )

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, the initial equation is 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial.

p is E/c, so 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

So, cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) * c ] / (2 E )

Wait, no: 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, solving for cos(theta):

cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) * c ] / (2 E )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should rearrange it.

Let me write it again:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Multiply both sides by c:

2 E cos(theta) = m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm, but m_e c^2 is the rest energy of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV. But let's think about the energy.

Wait, the total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Each has rest energy m_e c^2, and their kinetic energies are (gamma - 1) m_e c^2.

So, electron's energy E_e = gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2.

Positron's energy E_p = gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2.

So the initial total energy E_initial = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

After annihilation, the energy goes into the photons. Since the two photons have the same energy, each has energy E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e c^2.

So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c^2. Therefore, E = 3 m_e c^2.

So, substituting back into our equation:

2 * (3 m_e c^2) * cos(theta) = m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m_e c^2 cos(theta) = m_e c^2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c^2:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Hmm, let's compute that numerically.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8729833, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.8729833 - 1.7320508 = 2.1409325.

Divide that by 6: 2.1409325 /6 ≈ 0.35682208.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568.

So theta is arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, because cos(60) is 0.5, cos(90) is 0, so 0.3568 is between 60 and 90, closer to 69 degrees.

But wait, the photons are moving at angles theta and -theta above and below the x-axis, respectively. So the angle between the two photons would be 2 theta.

So, if theta is about 69 degrees, the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 138. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Wait, the initial calculation gives theta ≈ 69 degrees, so the angle between the two photons is 2*theta ≈ 138 degrees.

Yes, that's option C.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in finding the initial total momentum? Let me double-check the initial steps.

Electron moving right with gamma_e=4, positron moving left with gamma_p=2.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = c * sqrt(15/16) = c*(sqrt(15)/4).

So p_e =4 m_e * (c sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p^2) = c * sqrt(3/4) = c*(sqrt(3)/2).

But since the positron is moving left, v_p = - c*(sqrt(3)/2).

So p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (- c*sqrt(3)/2 )= - m_e c sqrt(3).

So total initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

That's correct.

Then for the photons, each has p_photon = E/c, with E=3 m_e c^2. So p_photon =3 m_e c^2 / c =3 m_e c.

Each photon has momentum 3 m_e c.

But the two photons are moving at theta and -theta above and below the x-axis. So their x-components are 3 m_e c cos(theta) each.

So the sum in x-direction is 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

This must equal the initial momentum P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Equating: 6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c: 6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Which gives cos(theta) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ 2.1409/6 ≈0.3568.

Theta is arccos(0.3568)= approximately 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2*69=138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the correct answer would be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in directions symmetric about the x-axis, one upper-right and the other lower-right. The goal is to determine the angle between their directions.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum of the System
The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$, and the positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$. Their velocities are calculated as:
\[
v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = c \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = c \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Since the positron moves to the left, its velocity is $v_p = -\frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2}$.

The relativistic momentum of each particle is:
\[
p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \cdot \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15},
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \cdot \left(-\frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -m_e c \sqrt{3}.
\]
The total initial momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c \sqrt{15} - m_e c \sqrt{3} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]
After annihilation, the energy is carried by two photons of equal energy:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

### Step 3: Momentum of the Photons
Each photon has energy $E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2$, and since $E = pc$ for photons, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]
The photons move at angles $\theta$ above and below the x-axis, respectively. Their momentum components are:
\[
p_{1x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{1y} = p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta,
\]
\[
p_{2x} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{2y} = -p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta.
\]
The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
P_{\text{final}} = (p_{1x} + p_{2x}, p_{1y} + p_{2y}) = (2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, 0).
\]

### Step 4: Conservation of Momentum
Equating the total momentum before and after annihilation:
\[
2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = P_{\text{initial}} = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Substituting $p_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c$:
\[
2 (3 m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate $\theta$ and the Angle Between Photons
Numerically, $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$, so:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]
The angle between the two photons is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
