Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there?

Wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Oh, right, benzene is a ring with six carbons. So 1-bromo would be one carbon with Br, and another group on the adjacent carbon, making it 2-?

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe that's 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene or something like that. Oh wait, wait, 2-d might stand for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's 2-dimethylamino? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be 2-d, like a substituent? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. 1-bromobenzene-2-d could be 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene. But wait, another thought: sometimes in such problems, the substituents are in specific positions. 

But perhaps I should focus on the reaction part. The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh right, that's a strong base. I remember that in aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is a strong base and a good deprotonating agent. It
