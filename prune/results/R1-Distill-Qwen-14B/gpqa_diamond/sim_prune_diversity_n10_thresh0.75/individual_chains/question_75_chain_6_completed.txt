Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with transgenic mice and protein expression. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They've introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus so they can purify the protein later. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but when they checked, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, I'm supposed to find out why the overexpression isn't happening. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different reason.

First, I'll look at the sequence provided. Let me scan through it to see if I can spot any obvious issues.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). That's good because it means translation should start. Then there's the HA tag sequence, I assume, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the construct starts with ATG, then the HA sequence. Now, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. Possible issues could be a mistake in the coding sequence leading to no protein, or maybe issues with the expression vector, like a missing promoter, but the question says the problem is in the construct's sequence.

Option A says the HA determinant has a missense mutation. That would change the amino acids, but would that prevent overexpression? Maybe, but if it's just a mutation, the protein might still be expressed but not recognized for purification. But the issue here is overexpression, so perhaps the protein isn't being made.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a stop codon in the sequence, the ribosome would stop there. Looking at the sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA). Let me scan through the nucleotides.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets. Let's see:

The sequence is long, so I'll go through it methodically.

Looking at the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC A... Hmm. Let me see each triplet.

Wait, the first triplet is ATG (start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), etc. So far, no stop codon.

Wait, but let me check the end. The sequence ends with ...TGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, at the very end, the last part is ...GAGTGA. That's GAG (Glu) followed by TGA. Oh, wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh, but wait, the sequence is written as 5' to 3', so the last part is GAG TGA. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

But wait, if the construct is in the same reading frame, that would cause a premature stop. But wait, the entire coding sequence would have to be in frame. So if the last part has a TGA stop codon, that would be a problem.

Wait, but the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So that would mean the gene construct ends with a stop codon. But wait, the construct is supposed to produce a fusion protein with the HA tag. So the presence of a stop codon would terminate translation early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being made, leading to no overexpression. So that's a problem.

But why is the stop codon at the end? If the construct is correctly designed, it should end with the GADD45G sequence, followed perhaps by a poly-A signal, but the coding sequence should not contain an internal stop.

Wait, the construct starts with ATG and ends with TGA. So the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, which would cause the ribosome to stop there, producing a truncated protein or no protein if the stop is in the middle. So that's probably why the overexpression isn't happeningâ€”the construct includes a stop codon in the coding sequence, causing translation to terminate early.

Wait, but where is the TGA located? Let's look again. The last part is ...CGC TGG CGG CGA GGA GAG CCG CAG CGT TAA CGA CGT GGC TGC CCA TCA CCA CTC CCC CGA GTG AGT GAG TGA3'?

Wait, I might have miscounted. Let me extract the last few triplets.

Wait, the full sequence ends with ...AGC TGG GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCT GCC GGC GTG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT ATG TGC GCG TGG GCG CAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA3'

Wait, breaking it into triplets:

... AGC TGG GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCT GCC GGC GTG GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT ATG TGC GCG TGG GCG CAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, the TGA is at the very end. So the stop codon is at the end of the coding sequence. That's a problem because the ribosome would terminate translation when it reaches the stop codon. But wait, the stop codon is supposed to be at the end, right? So the coding sequence should end with a stop codon. So why is that an issue?

Wait, perhaps the stop codon in the construct is correct, but maybe there's another issue. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is that the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence. But in this case, the stop is at the end, which is normal. So that might not be the issue.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the problem is that the stop codon is in a different reading frame. Wait, but the construct is designed in the same frame, so that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the construct includes a stop codon in the middle. Let me scan the sequence for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in frame.

Looking through the sequence for in-frame stop codons. Let me see:

Looking for TAG, TGA, TAA in the same reading frame. Let's see some parts.

After the initial ATG, the next triplet is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (asp), TAC (tyr), GCC (ala), etc. No stops there.

Continuing:

...CTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, let's look for TGA. There's a TGA in the middle: ...GTG TCC TGA C... Hmm. So the triplet is TGA. So that's a stop codon. So that's in the middle of the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no functional protein. Oh, wait, I think I found it.

So the construct includes a TGA in the middle, which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to stop early, leading to the protein not being expressed properly. So the issue is that there's a premature stop codon in the sequence.

So the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon due to a TGA in the middle. Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early due to a stop codon. So that would explain the lack of overexpression.

But wait, how did this happen? The person modified the coding sequence by adding the HA tag. Did they introduce a mutation that caused a stop codon?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag sequence was inserted incorrectly, introducing a stop codon. But in the given sequence, I see a TGA in the middle. Let me check where.

Looking for the exact position. Let me look for the TGA. Let's count triplets.

Wait, the sequence is a long stretch. Let me look for the TGA. The section that reads ...GTG TCC TGA C... So that's TGA in the middle.

So the presence of TGA would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to early termination. Therefore, the protein isn't produced as expected, hence no overexpression.

So the correct option is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but why is there a TGA in the middle? That must be a mistake in the construct. Maybe when inserting the HA tag, a stop codon was introduced inadvertently.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag's coding sequence had a stop codon, but I think the HA sequence is just the tag, so it should be in frame without introducing a stop.

But in this case, the given construct has a TGA, which is a stop codon, so the ribosome would terminate early, preventing the production of the full-length protein.

So the correct answer should be B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the N-terminus, failed to produce the expected overexpression. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand was analyzed to determine the cause.

The sequence begins with the start codon (ATG) and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag and GADD45G. A critical observation is the presence of the stop codon **TGA** in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon is in frame and would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the production of the full-length protein. As a result, the protein is either truncated or not produced at all, leading to the lack of overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would alter the amino acids but would not necessarily prevent overexpression. The issue here is the lack of full-length protein, so this is unlikely to be the cause.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: The presence of the in-frame stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation early, leading to incomplete or absent protein production. This aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: Proteolysis typically occurs post-translationally, and there is no evidence in the sequence to suggest the absence of a linker sequence causing this issue.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: The sequence contains a TGA stop codon, not UAA, so this option is irrelevant.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence caused the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the production of the full-length protein.

**Answer: B**
