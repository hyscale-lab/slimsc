Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 ml (200 cm³) of volume and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given.

Hmm, first, I remember that orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-. So we need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Wait, but I think I need to consider the phosphate buffer system here. Because the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. KH2PO4 is a weak acid, right? And Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base. So this is a buffer solution.

I recall that in buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa do I use here? Because H3PO4 has three dissociation steps.

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

Since KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (as K+ is the counterion) and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (with Na+), the relevant pKa here would be Ka2 because we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in a buffer. So the pH of the solution is determined by the second dissociation.

Wait, but wait. The HPO4^2- is the base, and H2PO4^- is the acid. So in the Henderson equation, [base] is [HPO4^2-], [acid] is [H2PO4^-]. So pKa would be the Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(
