Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

The problem says that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. That's good because it means Newton's laws apply without any funny business from acceleration or changing reference frames. So, no need to worry about general relativity or anything like that.

The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a huge speed! Like, a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So relativistic effects might matter here, but I'm not sure if that's required for this problem.

The question is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? So, we need to find the distance, d, in the Galaxy's frame (S), given time t' =50 s in the ejecta's frame (S').

Wait, but wait. If the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at some speed v. Conversely, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v, but which way? Oh, but the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but if both are inertial frames, we can use the velocity addition formula from special relativity to find the actual speed in the Galaxy's frame. Oh right, because in Galilean relativity, velocities just add, but at such high speeds, we need to use the relativistic formula.

So the velocity in the Galaxy's frame (v) and the ejecta's frame (u) are related by the velocity addition formula. Wait, the formula is u = (v - V)/(1 - (vV)/cÂ²), where V is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, and u is the speed of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, maybe I have it backward. Let me think
