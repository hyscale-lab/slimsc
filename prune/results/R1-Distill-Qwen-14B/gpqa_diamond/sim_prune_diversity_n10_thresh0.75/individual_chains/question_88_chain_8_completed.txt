Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and delivered via oral gavage. Then, they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. So, what's the process here?

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they play a role in immune responses, especially to things that get into the gut, like oral vaccines or pathogens. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gut, so the immune response in the gut is likely what's happening here.

When they isolate the proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches, those cells are probably B-cells that have been activated. The variable heavy chain gene's high variability suggests that each B-cell has a different antibody, which I think relates to the immune system's diversification mechanisms.

Wait, the options are about different processes. Let me think about each one:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process where B-cells introduce mutations into their antibody genes during the immune response, leading to more diverse antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers during the secondary immune response.

B) Complement activation: That's about the complement system attacking pathogens, leading to their destruction. Not sure how that directly relates to gene variability in B-cells.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when B-cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination of the heavy chain. But does this lead to high variability in the variable region? I don't think so. Class switching is more about the type of antibody produced, not the diversity in the antigen-binding site.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process during B-cell and T-cell development where variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create a wide variety of receptors. This happens early in development, during the primary immune response. But in this case, the question says that after immunization (oral gavage), the cells are proliferating and show high variability. So would VDJ be the process here?

Wait, no. VDJ happens when the cells are developing in the bone marrow or thymus. After an immune response, the B-cells undergo somatic hypermutation. So the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after immunization is likely due to somatic hypermutation. Because each B cell's antibody is being slightly altered to better bind the antigen.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.

Wait, but another point: The initial infection leads to activation and proliferation of B cells. In the germinal centers, these B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and selection, leading to a diverse population of antibodies. So when they isolate the proliferating cells, those would have undergone this hypermutation, hence the high variability in the variable regions.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence of some proteins is destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, but those reaching the secondary lymphoid organs, such as Peyer patches, show high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after sequencing the proliferating cell population. This suggests an immune response involving B-cells.

Key points to consider:

1. **Peyer Patches**: These are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are involved in immune responses to pathogens or antigens in the gut.
2. **High Variability in Variable Heavy Chain Gene**: This indicates a process that generates diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies.
3. **Somatic Hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B-cells introduce mutations into their antibody genes to increase diversity and specificity.
4. **Other Options**:
   - **Complement Activation**: Relates to pathogen destruction, not variability in B-cell genes.
   - **Class Switching Recombination**: Changes the class of antibody produced, not the variability in the antigen-binding site.
   - **VDJ Recombination**: Occurs during early immune development, not during the secondary immune response described here.

The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene after immunization is consistent with somatic hypermutation, which diversifies antibodies during the immune response. Therefore, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
