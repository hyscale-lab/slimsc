Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). So I need to compute the non-Gaussianity, nG, which is the relative entropy between the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let's break it down.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the state |psi>. Since |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, rho will be |psi><psi|. So rho would be (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha>><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ]) divided by N squared.

But wait, the normalization N is given, so N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). Because phi is given as -pi/4, let me compute that first. Since phi = -pi/4, sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1.

So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let's compute the exponent: 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. Then sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So the term inside N is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. Okay.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Let me compute that. It would be [ |alpha><alpha| + |-alpha>><-alpha| - |alpha><-alpha| -
