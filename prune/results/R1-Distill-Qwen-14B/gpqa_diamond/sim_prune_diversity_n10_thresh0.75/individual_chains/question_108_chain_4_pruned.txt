Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I guess m is the magnetic quantum number for the electron's orbital angular momentum. So, small m values... like maybe m=0 or m=1? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's what it means.

The problem is asking me to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is λ = 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the wavelength of the Balmer series' first line, the H-alpha line. That transition is from n=2 to n=1, I think. Or wait, no, wait: H-alpha is from n=3 to n=2. Oh right, I remember that the Balmer series starts at n=2, so the first line is n=3 to n=2. Let me double-check, but I think that's correct.

So, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels in hydrogen. I can calculate ΔE using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. Oh wait, but since lambda is given, maybe I should use the relation E = hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. That might be easier.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the interaction of a magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio (like the Landé g-factor), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But wait, in the case of paramagnetism, the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be -μ_B B m multiplied by something else? Hmm, maybe I should write that more precisely.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H_para = -μ·B. And μ for orbital angular momentum is (e/(2m_e)) * L, so when you apply the dot product with B, which is along Oz, it becomes proportional to m. So I think the expectation value ⟨H_para⟩ would be proportional to m * B.

So, let's get the numbers. Let me make a list of constants:

- Planck's constant h = 6.626e-34 J·s
- Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s
- Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T
- Rydberg constant R = 1.097e7 m^-1 (Wait, earlier I said 1.097e4, but that's with different units. Wait, no, the Rydberg constant is about 1.097e7 m^-1. But I'm a bit confused because when calculating wavelength, sometimes the formula uses 1/lambda = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²) )

Wait, the transition is given with wavelength λ=0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. That's in the visible range, so it's definitely the Balmer series. Let me calculate the energy ΔE for this transition.

Since E = hc/lambda, let's compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda = 486.1e-9 meters.
