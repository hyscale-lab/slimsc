Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, we've got three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about the orbital periods of these planets.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are approximately 1.4. So, T1 over T2 is 1.4, meaning Planet1 is hotter. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So T2 over T3 is 2.3, which means Planet2 is hotter than Planet3.

Additionally, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 is 1.15. And Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so M2/M3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, we're looking for Period3 / Period1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, but since all three are the same, maybe that cancels out in the equations.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. I think the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets orbit the same star (I assume), L and σ are constants. The albedos are the same, so they cancel out when taking ratios. So the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the distance.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), which is sqrt(1/D²)^(1/2) → 1/sqrt(D). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so T1 = (D2/D1)^(1/2) * T2 / 1.4.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write it as T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2 / D1). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if T1 is larger than T2, then D1 must be smaller than D2.

So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring, 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 =5.29 * D2.

But wait, D2 is 1.96 D1, so D3 =5.29 *1.96 D1. Let's compute that. 5.29 * 1.96.

Calculating that: 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29*1.96 is approx 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.3684 D1.

So the distances are D1, D2=1.9
