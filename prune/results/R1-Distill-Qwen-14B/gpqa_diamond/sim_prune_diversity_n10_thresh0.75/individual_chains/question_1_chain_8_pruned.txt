Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I need to figure out which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. Let me start by thinking about what the question is asking.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two levels, and we need to find the minimum energy difference between them that allows that.

Wait, right, when dealing with the lifetimes of energy states, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh, right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. The formula I think is ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the lifetime (time uncertainty). Or maybe it's just ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factor. Oh well, maybe the factor isn't critical for this problem since the options are given in orders of magnitude.

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would determine the smallest detectable difference between their energies. To clearly distinguish two states, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the signals might overlap and we can't tell them apart.

So for each energy level, I need to calculate the uncertainty in energy, which is the minimum detectable difference. Then, the actual energy difference should be larger than this value for both.

Wait, but the energies are E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are τ1 and τ2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ/(τ). Because ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), but maybe for this problem, the factor of 2 isn't important.

So, ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should convert the energy uncertainty into eV.

Let me compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

First, state 1: τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 τ1)
= (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= (1.05e-34) / (2e-9)
= 5.25e-26 J

Now, converting J to eV. I remember that 1 eV = 1
