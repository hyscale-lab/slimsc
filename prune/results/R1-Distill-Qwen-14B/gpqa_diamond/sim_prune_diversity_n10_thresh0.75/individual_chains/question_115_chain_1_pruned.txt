Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

Hmm. Right, so this is a conservation of momentum problem, but in the context of relativity because of the Lorentz factors involved. Let me think about what I remember.

First, in annihilation, an electron and positron (which are each other's antiparticles) annihilate into energy, usually gamma rays or photons. But in this case, they produce two photons. Since photons have momentum but no mass, their energy and momentum are related by E = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.

So, conservation of momentum must hold here. Both the electron and positron have their own momenta before the collision. The total momentum before collision should equal the total after, which is the sum of the two photons' momenta.

Wait, but since the electron is moving left to right, and the positron is moving right to left? Wait no, the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is towards the left? Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, the electron is moving to the right (left to right), and the positron is moving to the left (right to left). So their initial momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify: The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the leftâ€”so its direction is to the right (positive x-direction). The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left (negative x-direction). So their initial momenta are opposite in direction.

But wait, the problem says "moving along the horizontal axis from the left" for the electron. So 'from the left' implies it's moving towards the right. Similarly, the positron is moving from the right, so towards the left.

So, the initial momenta are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

But
