Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system consisting of a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to calculate the potential energy when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere, which has radius R, and it's grounded.

Wait, potential energy between charges. Right, I remember that potential energy is related to the work done to bring charges together. But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, so it can have charges induced on it but the potential is kept at zero? Or is it that the sphere's potential is zero? I think when a conductor is grounded, any excess charge can leave, so for a neutral conductor, it's zero potential.

So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute on the surface. But because the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can flow into the ground, right? Or wait, maybe the sphere's potential is fixed at zero by grounding. So the sphere's potential is zero, and the charge q is somewhere outside.

Wait, the charge q is placed d distance away from the center of the sphere. So d must be larger than R because if d is less than R, the charge would be inside the sphere, but I think the problem assumes it's outside. Because if the charge is inside, the sphere being conductor would shield the interior, but maybe that's a different scenario.

In any case, when you bring a charge near a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will create an image charge configuration. Oh wait, I think this relates to the method of images. The method of images is used in electrostatics to solve problems involving conductors. So for a point charge near a conducting sphere, we can model it with an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how the image charge works for a sphere. Let me think. For a conducting sphere, when a charge q is placed outside, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. The image charge q' is located at a point inside the sphere such that the distance from the center is r', where (r') = (R^2)/d. Because the image charge's position is such that R² = d * R', so R' = R² /d. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, for the sphere, the image charge is located at a distance of R^2 / d from the center, right? So if d is the distance of the real charge from the center, the image charge is at R²/d.

Wait, no, I think the image charge position is such that the distance from the center is R^2/d. So let me write that: the image charge q' is located at a distance d' = R² / d from the center, on the same line as the real charge and the center.

But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to the real charge and the image charge at the surface must cancel out.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this from the potential energy standpoint. The potential energy U of a system of charges is the work done in assembling them. So in this case, the system is the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so perhaps the induced charges are connected to the ground, making the potential of the sphere zero. Hmm, how does that affect the potential energy?

Alternatively, think of the system as the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges are free to move, but the sphere's potential is zero. So the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but in the method of images, the potential energy can be calculated as the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge. Because the image charge represents the effect of the conducting sphere's induced charges. So the total potential energy U is the potential energy between q and its image charge q'.

But wait, what's the value of q' in this
