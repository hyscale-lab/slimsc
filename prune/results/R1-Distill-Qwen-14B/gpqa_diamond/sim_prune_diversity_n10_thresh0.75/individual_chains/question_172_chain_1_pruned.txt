Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of elements depend on the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more atoms are excited to higher energy levels.

The problem mentions that the energy difference between the energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's probably related to the Boltzmann factor. The Boltzmann distribution equation comes into play here because we're dealing with atoms in thermal equilibrium (LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, and T is the temperature. Since the question says the excitation is twice as much, maybe the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a specific energy level, the excitation level is higher in star_1. So I think the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2, but wait, actually, the problem says that the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state population (or some lower state) is 2 in star_1 and 1 in star_2? Or maybe the ratio is twice as big in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the problem states: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher—so the number of atoms in the higher energy state is higher in star_1. But for the same energy level difference, the ratio depends on temperature.

So, let me think. Let's say for star_1, the ratio of n_upper/n_lower is 2 times that of star_2
