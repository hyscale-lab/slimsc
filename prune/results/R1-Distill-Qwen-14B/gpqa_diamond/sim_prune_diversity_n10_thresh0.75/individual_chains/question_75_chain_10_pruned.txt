Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transfected cells. Let me read through the problem and try to break it down.

So the setup: the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct that overexpresses GADD45G, modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. So they looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found the issue.

The options are A to D, each suggesting a different problem. Let me think about each possibility.

First, the sequence provided is the coding sequence (CDS) for the modified GADD45G. The HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence should be right at the beginning. Let me imagine what the HA tag looks like. HA is a peptide from the influenza virus, and inserting its coding sequence would involve adding the appropriate nucleotides at the start.

Looking at the given sequence, the very first part is ATG, which is the start codon. So the HA should come before the initial ATG? Wait, no. Wait, wait. The N-terminus of the recombinant protein is the HA, so the HA coding sequence should be added before the GADD45G's own start codon. But wait, in the gene construct, the HA is part of the coding sequence. So the first part of the construct should be the HA coding sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but looking at the provided sequence, the very first part is ATG... So that's the start codon for GADD45G, not the HA. Oh wait, but the HA is added at the N-terminus. So the HA's coding sequence should be before the ATG of GADD45G.

Wait a minute. If the HA is at the
