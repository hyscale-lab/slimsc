Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through multiple steps to form a final product. The options are all biphenyl derivatives with various substituents. Hmm, I think I'll need to track each reaction step to determine what's happening.

First, the initial reaction: benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene involves using a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes nitration, adding a nitro group. But where does it add? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitration typically occurs in the meta position unless something else directs it. Wait, no, wait. Nitration adds a nitro group as a meta director. Wait, no, wait again. Nitration is a meta director? Or para? Wait, nitration is usually a meta-directing group because the nitro group is strongly deactivating. Oh wait no, wait. When you nitrate benzene, the first nitration adds a nitro group in the para position? Or is it meta? Wait, no, no, wait. Benzene is symmetric, so the nitration would form nitrotoluene—wait no, we're starting with benzene, so the product would be nitrobenzene. And the nitro group is a meta director.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Benzene when nitrated with concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4, which is a strong nitrating agent, typically adds the nitro group as the substituent. Since benzene is symmetric, the product is a single isomer—nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. So the nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as product 1.

Wait, no. Wait, nitration of benzene adds nitro groups, but in the case of benzene, the product is a single nitrobenzene. The position is either meta or para, but wait, benzene is a ring without substituents, so the nitration can only add in one way. No, wait, benzene is symmetric, so the first nitration gives nitrobenz
