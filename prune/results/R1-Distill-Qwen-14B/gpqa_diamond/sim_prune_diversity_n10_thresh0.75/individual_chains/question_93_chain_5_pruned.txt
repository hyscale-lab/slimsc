Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of DNA or RNA in a sample. The scientist made a calibration curve by using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran three technical replicates for each concentration.

The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. R2 is 1, so the data fits perfectly, right? The slope was -3.3. Wait, I remember that the slope is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope in a qPCR calibration curve is something like -3.32 divided by the efficiency, but if efficiency is 100%, which is 1, then the slope should be about -3.32. Oh wait, the given slope is -3.3, which is close enough, probably due to rounding or something.

Looking at the data, each concentration is diluted tenfold. So from 100000 to 10000 is a 10x dilution. The Ct values are supposed to increase by a certain amount when you dilute the sample. Because each cycle is a doubling, a tenfold dilution should increase Ct by about 3.32 cycles. Let me check the data.

At 100000 copies, the Ct is around 34 (33.9,34.2,34.5). At 10000 copies, it's around 31 (30.6,30.9,31.2). The difference is 3.3 cycles. Oh, that's exactly what the slope would predict. Then at 1000 copies, Ct is 27.3, which is 30.6 minus 3.3? Wait, no. Wait, 100000 to 10000 is a 10x dilution, Ct goes up by about 3.3, which matches. Then from 10000 to 1000 is another 10x, so Ct goes up another 3.3. Let's see, 30.6 minus 3.3 is 27.3, which is exactly the next Ct. Similarly, 1000 to 100 is another 10x, so an increase of 3.3 in Ct. 27.3 minus 3.3 is 24, which matches. Then 100 to 10 copies is another 10x, so Ct should go up by 3.3 again. 24 minus 3.3 is 20.7, which is exactly the next Ct. So each consecutive dilution is a 10x, and the Ct increases by about 3.3 as expected. 

Wait, but the question says the options are about discrepancies in his results. So why is there a question about discrepancies? Oh, looking at the options, perhaps the issue is that the Ct values aren't matching
