Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So the astronaut's own time would be different from the time experienced by someone on Earth.

The question says the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast! I think that means the time experienced by the astronaut will be much less than the time it takes from Earth's perspective.

Wait, but what's the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth? Oh wait, wait, the problem doesn't give that. Oh! Maybe I don't need the actual distance because perhaps it's a trick question. Or maybe it's implied that the distance is 150 light-years? Because the average lifetime is 150 solar years. Hmm, but if the speed is nearly light speed, then from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance over speed. But from the astronaut's frame, it would be less due to time dilation.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the spacecraft's journey time. Let's see, if the distance is, say, D, then the Earth time would be D/(0.99999987c). But the astronaut's time would be Earth time multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma, but wait, no, wait. Wait, time dilation is such that the moving clock (the astronaut's) runs slower. So the Earth observer would see the astronaut's clock as ticking slower.

Wait, the astronaut ages 22, but the question is how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. So we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut.

Proper time is calculated using the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, let me compute that. Let me calculate v squared over c squared: (0.99999987)^2 is approximately 0.99999974, because (1 - a)^2 is about 1 - 2a when a is very small. So 1 - 0.99999974 is 0.00000026. So
