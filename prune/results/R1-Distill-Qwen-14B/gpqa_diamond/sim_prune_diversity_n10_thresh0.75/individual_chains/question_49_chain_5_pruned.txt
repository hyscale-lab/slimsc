Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions involve the shift of a pi bond to a sigma bond, right?

The question has three different reactions, each producing a product A, B, or C. I need to figure out each product based on the starting materials and the reagents given. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different structures for A, B, and C.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. The amine is on a carbon that has two methoxy groups attached. So the structure is like (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the amine on carbon 1, with two methoxy groups also on carbon 1. So maybe (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Hmm, but that's ethanamine, right? So ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine.

And the other reagent is but-3-en-2-ol. So that's an alcohol with a double bond between carbons 3 and 2. The structure would be CH2CH2OHCH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond starts at C3? Wait, but wait, the but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that can't be right because but has four carbons. Let me think, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, carbon numbering: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4, and the hydroxyl is on C2. So structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, but but
