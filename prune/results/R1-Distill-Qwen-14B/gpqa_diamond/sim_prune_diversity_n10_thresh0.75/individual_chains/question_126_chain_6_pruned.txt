Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that an organic chemist performs two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH and then an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. After the reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral stationary phase HPLC. The question is how many peaks the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what the products of each reaction are, then see how many are present when combined, and then determine how they would separate on the different HPLC columns.

First, let me tackle Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the ketone group in hexan-3-one will be reduced. Let me write the structure of the starting material. Hexan-3-one would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon. The 5-methoxy group is on the fifth carbon, which is adjacent to the ketone.

So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexane has six carbons. So hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should number it: 1 2 3 4 5 6. So 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, hexane is six carb
