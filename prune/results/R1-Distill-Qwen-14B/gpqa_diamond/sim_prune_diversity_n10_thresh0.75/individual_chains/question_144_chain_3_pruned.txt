Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right! The formula is something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But how do I find the velocity and the lifetime from the given data?

Let me recall. The mean lifetime (tau) of a particle is related to its width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. In particle physics, the width Γ is like the energy uncertainty for the particle's lifetime. So Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Rearranging that, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ. Because ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Or perhaps I should express ħ in terms of GeV and seconds. Let me remember the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π), so around 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But I need this in GeV·s units.

I know that 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. Therefore, 1 GeV·s is 1.602e-10 J·s. So ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Wait, where did I get that number? Oh right, because ħ ≈ 197 MeV·fm, but that's another unit. Let me calculate it properly.

Alternatively, I can remember that ħ
