Okay, so I've got this question about a chemistry problem, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question is about analyzing the NMR and LC-MS results of a chemically synthesized small peptidic compound. The NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, and the integrals are equal, adding up to 1H. They ruled out spin-spin coupling as a reason, so it's not because of coupling with neighboring protons.

Looking at the LC-MS data, there are two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as the expected molecule. So, the mass is correct for both. But why are there two peaks?

Let me think about the options.

Option A is that it's contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different. The question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So a precursor would have a higher mass, I think. So A is probably not correct.

Option B is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight but are non-superimposable. But enantiomers don't usually split peaks in NMR the same way because in NMR, if the compound is not chiral, you wouldn't see splitting. Wait, but wait, if the compound is a racemic mixture (equal parts enantiomers), in an achiral environment, like if the NMR is run without chiral conditions, the peaks would be singlets. However, if the sample is chiral, like in a chiral environment, you might get different shifts. Wait, but the NMR's alpha-proton shows two peaks. But the coupling isn't the issueâ€”I think because the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are superimposable in NMR when run in an achiral environment. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for each proton. So if the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, that's not consistent with enantiomers. So I think B is not the correct answer.

Option C is 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Maybe it's during the formation of the amide bond, like when the coupling reaction forms two different bonds or something like that? Or perhaps it's some kind of side reaction leading to two different products. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the coupling leads to two different byproducts. Hmm. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the same mass. Wait, the problem states that both peaks in LC-MS have the same mass. So double coupling leading to two structures with same mass? Not sure.

Option D is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR shifts. In the NMR, each diastereomer would give a different peak for the
