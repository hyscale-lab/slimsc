Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian and some particle content. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the Standard Model has these Higgs fields, but here we have an extended model. The fields mentioned are singlet fermions N_{iR}, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar phi. The N's have quantum numbers (1,1,0), which I think means they are SU(2) singlets, charge 1 under hypercharge? Wait, no, the hypercharge Y is determined by the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula: Q = T3 + Y/2. Since they're (1,1,0), T3 is 0 because they're singlets. So 0 = 0 + Y/2 ⇒ Y=0. So their hypercharge is zero.

The scalar S is a doublet, so (1,2,1). So it's an SU(2) doublet, hypercharge 1. And phi is a singlet, (1,1,0), so hypercharge 0.

The Lagrangian terms: I see kinetic terms for N_R, a term for the derivatives of phi, a term for D^mu S squared. The D^mu is the covariant derivative, so that term is the gauge interaction for the scalar doublet S. Then there are terms like y_i/2 * phi * the conjugate of N_iR times themselves. Wait, the N's are in the conjugate, so maybe they are Dirac fermions, and we're doing a Yukawa coupling. The term
