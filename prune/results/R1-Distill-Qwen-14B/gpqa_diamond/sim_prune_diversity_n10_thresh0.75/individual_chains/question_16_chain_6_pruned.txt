Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in some organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through each compound one by one. Let me remember what makes a compound optically active. Oh right, it's about having chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry that prevents the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image. 

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many are optically active. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. Let's go through each.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Hmm, let me draw this structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Chlorine is on C1, which is also double-bonded. So the groups are Cl, CH2CH3 (since it's 2-methyl), and two CH2 groups? Wait, but wait, but in the Z configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be on the same side. But does this molecule have a chiral center? The molecule has a double bond, so maybe it's about geometric isomerism rather than optical activity. Oh, wait, the molecule itself, with the double bond, can't have a chiral center because the double bond restricts rotation. So the molecule is planar around the double bond, but does it have a stereogenic center? Let me see. The structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C1 is connected to Cl, a double bond, and maybe another group. Wait, but C1 is also connected to a CH2CH2CH3 or something? Or wait, but wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the structure is Cl-C double bond to CH(CH2CH3) or something?

Wait, no. Let's break down the formula: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2 or something? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but the but-1-ene
