Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the potentials. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r at time t. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions. So I need to figure out the correct expressions based on what I know about potentials from moving charges.

First, I recall that the scalar potential for a static charge (not moving) is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, does this change? Well, the scalar potential is primarily due to the electric field, right? So even a moving charge would have a scalar potential, but maybe it's not just simply that expression anymore because of relativistic effects or because of the way the fields transform.

Wait, no. Actually, the scalar potential for a charge in motion can be a bit more complicated. Because when charges move, they produce magnetic fields as well. But the scalar potential is still mainly about the electric part. Wait, but I think that for a charge moving at some velocity, the scalar potential still might be similar to the static case if you're looking at the potential at a time after the charge has moved. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Then there's the vector potential, which is directly related to the magnetic field. The vector potential for a moving charge would depend on its velocity, I think. The magnetic field due to a moving charge (current) is something like B = (μ₀/4π) (I × r̂), but in this case, since it's a point charge, the current is a delta function along its velocity.

Wait, but the vector potential A is given by the integral of (μ₀/(4π)) (J · dl) / r, or something like that. Alternatively, for a steady current, the vector potential due to a point charge moving with velocity v would be something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times some function of position and time.

Wait, another approach: I think the potentials for a moving charge are derived using retarded time. Because the fields are caused by the charge at an earlier time, tr, which is called the retarded time. So the fields at time t depend on where the charge was at time tr, not where it is now.

So for the scalar potential, the expression would involve the charge's position at the retarded time, and similarly for the vector potential. But how exactly?

The scalar potential V(r, t) is usually given by (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ (ρ(r', t')) / |r - r'| d³r', where t' is the retarded time. Since the charge is a point charge, ρ is a delta function, so V would be (q/(4πε₀)) / |r - r'(t_r)|, where r'(t_r) is the position at time tr.

Similarly
