Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when particles annihilate, their energy and momentum must be conserved. So I think I should start by calculating the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision.

First, let's get the rest mass energy of the electron and positron. Both are the same, right? The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so that's their rest energy. But wait, since they're moving, their total energy is gamma times the rest energy.

The electron has a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 4. So its total energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV. The positron's gamma is 2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV.

Wait, but direction matters for momentum. The electron is moving to the right (since it's going from left to right), and the positron is moving to the left (from right to left). So their momenta will be opposite in direction.

Momentum p is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v, and v = c²/(beta c) or something. Maybe it's easier to compute the momentum in terms of gamma and rest mass.

Wait, another approach: Since the particles are moving along the same axis, let's consider their momenta as vectors. Let me assign the electron's direction as positive, and the positron's as negative since it's moving the opposite way.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since for electrons, gamma is 4, and m_e is the rest mass. Similarly, positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum will be negative.

Wait, but for a positron, the charge
