Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has two components: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each in a 200 cm³ solution. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the Ka values for H3PO4. 

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? Or wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is triprotic. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-; the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-; the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but wait, some sources might refer to H2PO4^- as orthophosphate too. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's in solution, it can lose H+ to form H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but some might consider H2PO4^- as orthophosphate. Hmm, but I think in this context, considering the problem, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So let me think about the salts.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate·2 waters. Its dissociation would give Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we'll have H2PO4^- from the first salt and HPO4^2- from the second. Additionally, these can interconvert based on the pH, which is influenced by the Ka values.

Wait, but the solution is a buffer because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, maybe in this case, the two salts provide both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs. So the solution should be a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the pH of the solution will determine the ratio of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Which one is it? Because HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate, and H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate. I'm a bit confused. Oh, the term 'orthophosphate' might refer to the HPO4^2- form. Or perhaps the problem refers to the sum of all phosphate species? But I think in this case, it's specifically asking for HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is H3PO4, but that's the neutral molecule. No, because the solution is in water, so it's ionized.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure this.

First, I need to calculate the concentrations of each of the salts in the solution.

The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

The mass of KH2PO4 is 1.00 g. Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol.

So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's compute that. 1/136 is about 0.00735 mol. Let me compute 136.09 into 1.00: 136.09 × 0.00735 ≈ 1. So 1 / 136.09 = approximately 0.00734 moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles.

So each salt contributes a certain amount.

Now, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. But in solution, the water doesn't affect the ions much, so the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- from the first salt and HPO4^2- from the second.
