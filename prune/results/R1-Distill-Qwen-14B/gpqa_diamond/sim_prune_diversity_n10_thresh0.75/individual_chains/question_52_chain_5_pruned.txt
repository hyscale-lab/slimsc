Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then there's a part about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So the ratio is level 1 to level 2. Let me think about the Boltzmann equation because it's about energy levels in LTE, which the problem states.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower. Wait, but wait: the spots are cooler regions, right? Because when sunspots appear on the Sun, they are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the star has spots covering part of its surface, the average Teff is lower than when there are no spots.

But the overall photosphere's effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots are present. Wait, is that the combined effect? Or is the spot's temperature lower than the surrounding?

Wait in the problem, when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's effective temperature is lower because the spots are cooler. But when spots are present, the observed Teff is lower.

Now, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Let's call this ratio R = (n1/n
