Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it properly. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a series of steps. I need to figure out which sequence will give the desired product in high yield.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromo group and a nitro group. Their positions are 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Wait, or is the numbering different? Let me think. The ketone is on the ethyl group, so the phenyl is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point of attachment (the carbonyl). So the structure would be benzene with a ketone group (as a substituent) at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5? Or are the substituents on the benzene ring in positions 3 and 5 relative to each other?

Wait, I think when you have a substituent on a benzene ring (like the ketone group), the numbering starts with that substituent as position 1. So, the ketone is at position 1. Then, the bromo is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, but that's only possible if the positions are arranged with the substituents at those specific spots. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is such that the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to each other, regardless of the ketone's position. Hmm, maybe I should think about the directing effects of the substituents.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a ketone group attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene has a substituent at position 1 (the ketone). Then,
