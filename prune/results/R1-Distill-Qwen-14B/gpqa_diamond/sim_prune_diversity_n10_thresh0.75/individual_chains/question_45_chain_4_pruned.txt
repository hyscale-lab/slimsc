Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy levels are multiples of E. Wait, for a single particle in a 1D box, the energy levels are En = n²E, right? Because E scales with n squared.

But here, we have four particles. Oh wait, and they're spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. Hmm, that must mean that the particles are fermions, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can be occupied by at most one particle.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum states are determined by the quantum number n and the spin. So for each n, there are two possible states: spin up and spin down. So for each n, two particles can occupy the same n because of the different spins.

Wait, the particles are identical spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each unique quantum state can hold one particle. A quantum state is defined by (n, spin). So for each n, there are two possible states: spin up and spin down.

So when placing four particles into the well, I need to fill the lowest energy states following the Pauli exclusion.
