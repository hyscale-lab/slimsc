Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. The first step is probably to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution, see which is in excess, and then calculate the pH based on that.

Let me start by breaking down each component.

First, CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, when you mix it with a strong acid or base, what happens? Oh wait, I think the strong acid or base will dominate the solution. So maybe the weak acid's contribution to H+ can be considered after dealing with the strong acid and base interactions.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it'll dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions.

So perhaps I should calculate the moles of H+ from HCl, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2, and see how they react. Any excess H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, find the volumes in liters. 

500 mL is 0.5 L, 400 mL is 0.4 L, 300 mL is 0.3 L.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol. Since it's a weak acid, it won't contribute much H+ compared to strong acids, but maybe I should consider it only after neutralization.

Moles of HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is strong, it'll give 0.08 mol H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, so I have H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2. Let me calculate the net reaction between H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

When acid and base mix, they neutralize each other: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So the moles of H+ and OH-:

H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So H+ is the limiting reagent here.

After neutralization, all 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH-.

Wait, no. Wait, when you mix them, the H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.18), so the OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. So the solution will have excess OH-.

But wait, what about the other solutions? The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- would be 0.10 mol / 1.2 L = 0.08333... M.
