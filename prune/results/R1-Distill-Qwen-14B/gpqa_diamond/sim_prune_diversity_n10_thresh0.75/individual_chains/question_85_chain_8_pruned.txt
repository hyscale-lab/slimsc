Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Hmm. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), or wait, maybe it's T_eq = ( (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * σ * a²) )^(1/4), but L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ... because the star's effective temperature and radius are known. Alternatively, I've heard that the equilibrium temperature can also be expressed as T_eq = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 * D) ) )^(1/2) ), where D is the distance between the planet and the star. But wait, I'm not getting the exact formula right. Let me think.

Oh right, the general formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 * a) ), assuming the planet's albedo is zero or
