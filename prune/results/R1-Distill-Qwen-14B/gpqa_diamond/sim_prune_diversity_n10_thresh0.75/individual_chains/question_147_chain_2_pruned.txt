Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two particles of types A+ and A-. The reaction is written as p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. They're asking for the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass. But wait, the proton and antiproton are colliding. Wait, in reality, protons and antiprotons annihilate each other, producing energy or other particles. But in this case, they are producing two A+ and two A- particles.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is 'slowly moving'. So maybe it's moving at a low velocity compared to the speed of light. But wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, does that mean the proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Hmm, I think I might be missing some key information here.

Wait, the question states that the antiproton is 'slowly moving' which probably implies that its speed is much lower than the speed of light. So maybe its kinetic
