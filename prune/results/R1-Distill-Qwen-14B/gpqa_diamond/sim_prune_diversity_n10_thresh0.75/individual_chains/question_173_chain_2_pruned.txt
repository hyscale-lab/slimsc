Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics and uncertainty principles. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: An electron is traveling at a speed v of 2 times 10^8 meters per second along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, with different orders of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, right. I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Wait, the principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The product of the uncertainties is at least a certain value.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes people use just ħ instead of dividing by 2. So maybe the exact formula depends on the convention. But for the purpose of this problem, I think the important thing is that Δx multiplied by Δp is proportional to ħ, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

Since the question asks about the uncertainty in energy, I need to connect this to ΔE. I recall that the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum. The energy of a particle is given by
