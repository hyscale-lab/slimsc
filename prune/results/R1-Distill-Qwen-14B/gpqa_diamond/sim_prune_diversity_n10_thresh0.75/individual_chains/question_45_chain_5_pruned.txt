Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle has its own energy level based on its quantum number.

Wait, the problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Oh right, and the particles are spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold at most two particles, with opposite spins.

The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite well is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m L²), right? And the problem provides E as E = π² ħ²/(2 m L²), so each energy level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, when you have multiple particles, you have to consider the possible states they can occupy. Since the particles are identical fermions, they can't all be in the same state. So each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles—because each quantum state can accommodate two particles with opposite spins.

Now, for four particles, let's think about how they fill up the energy levels. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So the first two particles would go into the lowest energy level (n=1), each with opposite spins. Then, the next two would go into the next available level, which is n=2. But wait, no, wait. Because each n level can have two particles, so for four particles, we have two levels filled: first n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So the ground state energy would be the sum of all their energies.

Wait, no, wait. Because each particle's energy is E_n = n² E, so for two particles at n=1, their energy is 1² E each, so total 2 * 1² E = 2E. For two at n=2, each is 2² E =4E, so total 2 *4E =8E. So the total ground state energy is 2E +8E =10E? Wait, but that's 10E. Hmm, but wait, that's for four particles in two levels. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the arrangement.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each energy level n can have up to two particles (because spin-up and spin-down). So the first level (n=1) can take two particles, so that's filled. The next level (n=2) can take another two, so that's filled as well. So four particles would have two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? But wait, looking at the options, I see option B includes 10E as the first excited state. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between the system's ground state and the individual particles' states.

Wait, no, the question is about the system's energy levels. So the ground state of the system is the lowest possible energy when all four particles are in the lowest possible configuration. Since each n can have two particles, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the total energy is 2*1² E + 2*2² E = (2 + 8) E =10E. So that's the ground state.

But wait, no, wait. Wait a second, I think I might have messed up. Because for four particles in a 1D box, each with spin 1/2, the ground state would fill the lowest possible orbitals. So the first two particles go into n=1 (each with opposite spins). Then the next two go into n=2 (again, opposite spins each). So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state is 1
