Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. Relativity must come into play. Let me think.

The question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So both are moving in the same direction. 

First, I think about relative speed. In classical mechanics, you'd subtract the speeds, but relativity doesn't work that way because of the velocity addition formula. I remember the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, I guess it's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that.

0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c². 0.3c² divided by c² is 0.3, so 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7). 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428... So about 0.14c. Let me note that down. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Now, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and I think total energy is the sum of their energies. The energy formula is gamma times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me calculate each energy separately.

For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2). 0.6 squared is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. So sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.25 multiplied by 2m is 2.5m. So the energy is 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2). 0.5 squared is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is about 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So the energy is 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.4641. So 3.4641 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. 1.1547 is approximately 2/sqrt(3) which is about 1.1547. So 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.4641m c².

So adding both energies: 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc². That's 5.9641 mc². Hmm, approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B is v_rel=0.1c and E=4.96 mc². Wait, no. So option C's energy is about 5.96 mc². So that's the correct energy.

So the correct answer should be option C, which has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute the energy correctly? Let me re-calculate the gammas.

First astronaut: mass 2m, v=0.6c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, v=0.5c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 mc². Sum is 5.9641 mc², which rounds to 5.96 mc². So yes, option C. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.9641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
