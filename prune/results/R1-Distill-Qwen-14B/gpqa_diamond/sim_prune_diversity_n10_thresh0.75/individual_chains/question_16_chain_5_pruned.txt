Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's chirality, which is when a molecule has a carbon with four different groups attached—like a stereocenter. Also, some compounds can be meso compounds, which are achiral even if they have stereocenters because of an internal plane of symmetry.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but wait. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents on each carbon would be Cl on C1 and a CH(CH3) on C2. But wait, wait, but wait, but wait—if the double bond is at position 1, meaning C1 and C2 are double bonded. So structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. Then, C2 has a methyl (CH(CH3) maybe, no. Wait, the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C double bond C-CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH-CH2CH3 but wait, 2-methyl, so the second carbon (C2) has a methyl group. So maybe it's Cl-C double bond C(CH2CH3)(CH3)? No, wait, wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3 but no, wait that's not. Wait, no, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the first carbon is Cl, double bonded to second, which has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C double bond C(CH3)-CH2
