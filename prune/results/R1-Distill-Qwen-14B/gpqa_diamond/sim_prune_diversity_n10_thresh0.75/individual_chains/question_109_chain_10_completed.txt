Alright, so I've got this physics problem to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about nuclear physics and the emission of a particle. The question involves two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The problem gives some conditions related to Pauli statistics and conservation laws. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. 

Okay, let me break this down. The initial state is a 1S0 state for the NN system. So, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). Wait, for 1S0, that would mean S=0 because 2S+1 =1 implies S=0. So, S=0, L=0 because it's S state, right? And J is 0 too. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

Then, the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is -1. Now, Pauli statistics require that the final NN state's isospin T, angular momentum S, and spin L satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. The given condition is T(NN)=0. So the final state's isospin is 0.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on isospin. I remember that for nucleons, isospin is a part of their classification. For example, a proton has isospin I=1/2, and a neutron also I=1/2. When two nucleons come together, their combined isospin can be T=0 or T=1. But in this case, the final NN state has T=0. So the total isospin is 0.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options involve different transitions, each ending with a particle (p, f, s, etc.), and different angular momenta. I think each option is a possible decay or emission, and I need to check which one violates the conservation laws.

The key here is to use conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli condition given: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, S here is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in the problem statement, the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Wait, let me clarify: S is the spin quantum number, L the orbital angular momentum, T the isospin.

Wait, but for the NN system, their total spin is S, their orbital angular momentum is L, and their total (angular) momentum is J = L + S. But the problem states T = S + L +1 mod2. So T is the isospin, which is a separate quantum number from angular momentum. Oh, so T is the isospin of the NN system, which is 0 in the final state.

So, T = S_NN + L_NN +1 mod2. Since T=0, the equation becomes 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod2. So S + L +1 must be even, meaning S + L must be odd. So S + L =1 mod2.

But wait, S is the spin of the NN system. Each nucleon has spin 1/2. So when two spin-1/2 particles combine, their total spin can be S=0 (singlet) or S=1 (triplet). But in the initial state, it's 1S0, so S=0. So for the initial state, S=0, L=0, J=0. But in the final state, after emitting a particle, the NN state's S and L might change.

Wait, but the problem is about emission of a particle, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. So the total system is NN plus X, but the problem is considering the final NN state's quantum numbers. So the NN system after emission will have their own S', L', J', and T=0.

But the initial NN state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. When they emit a particle, the NN system will have different quantum numbers, and the emitted particle X will carry away some angular momentum.

So the initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0 (since J=0). After emission, the total angular momentum must still be J_initial, so J_final for the entire system (NN + X) must be 0. But the problem is considering the NN state's J' (which is L' + S') and the X's angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0. The final state has the NN system with J' = L' + S' and the X particle with angular momentum l (lowercase l in the options), so the total J must be 0. So L' + S' + l must be 0. But that can't be unless L' + S' = l, and their vector sum equals to zero. Wait, that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the initial state has J_initial = 0. The total J after emission is the sum of the NN's J' and X's l. But since it's a decay, J_initial should equal J_final. Hmm, but J is a vector, so the sum of the vectors must equal zero. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can consider the scalar addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe parity is easier to handle first. The initial state has parity P_initial. The term symbol is 1S0. The parity for a term symbol is given by (-1)^L. So for L=0, parity is +1. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state must be P_initial * P_X * (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum quantum number for the emission (i.e., the partial wave).

Wait, the parity conservation is a bit tricky. The parity of the initial state is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. For the initial 1S0 state, L_initial is 0, so P_initial = (+1).

The final state's parity would be the product of the parity of the emitted particle and the parity of the NN system. But wait, when a particle is emitted, it's part of the decay, so the parity of the entire system must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state is equal to the parity of the final state.

The initial parity is P_initial = 1 (since L=0). The final parity is P_final = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{L_emission}, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (the partial wave). Because when a particle is emitted, it's via a transition that involves orbital angular momentum L_emission, and the parity changes by (-1)^L_emission.

Wait, no. When a particle is emitted, the parity of the system (before emission) is equal to the parity of the products (after emission) multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle and the angular momentum dependence.

Wait, the general formula is: P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^{L}, where L is the orbital angular momentum (the partial wave) of the emitted particle.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The parity of the initial state (NN) is 1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, but the orbital angular momentum L of X is the same as the partial wave of the emission. So, P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L.

So in this case, initial parity P_initial = 1. P_NN_final is the parity of the NN system after emission, which is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN in the final state. P_X is the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle, which is -1.

So, 1 = [(-1)^{L'}] * (-1) * (-1)^L.

Simplify this equation: 1 = (-1) * (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^L.

Wait, no. Let me write it properly. P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X * (-1)^L.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is P_initial = (-1)^L * P_NN_final * P_X.

Because the orbital angular momentum L of the emitted particle contributes a (-1)^L factor to the parity. So the equation is:

1 = (-1)^L * [(-1)^{L'}] * (-1)

Because P_NN_final is (-1)^L', and P_X is (-1). So,

1 = (-1)^L * (-1)^{L'} * (-1).

Combine the exponents:

1 = (-1)^{L + L' + 1}.

So (-1) raised to (L + L' +1) must equal 1. Therefore, (L + L' +1) must be even. So L + L' +1 ≡ 0 mod 2. Which implies L + L' must be odd.

So, L + L' ≡ 1 mod 2.

Now, moving on to the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, the problem states that the condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2. So S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

Wait, but in the final state, the NN system has spin S and orbital angular momentum L, so their sum must be odd. So S + L is odd.

But in the initial state, before emission, the NN system had S=0, L=0. After emission, the NN system's S' and L' are determined based on the decay. But the problem is considering the final state of the NN, so S' is their spin and L' is their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the emitted particle X has its own angular momentum, which is the orbital angular momentum in the decay, denoted as l in the options. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission is L', which is related to the initial and the emitted. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the key is to look at each option and see if they satisfy both the parity condition and the Pauli condition.

Each option gives the initial state, then the final state of the NN, and the type of particle emitted. For example, option A is 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So the NN goes from 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0) to 7D1. The term 7D1 implies (2S'+1)L'(J'), so 7 is 2S'+1=7 → S'=3. L' is D, which is 2. So S'=3, L'=2. Then, the emitted particle is a proton (p), which has spin 1/2, but more importantly, intrinsic parity.

So for each option, I can compute whether the parity condition and the Pauli condition are satisfied.

Let's take each option one by one.

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

Initial state: 1S0 → S=0, L=0, J=0.

Final NN state: 7D1 → (2S'+1)=7 → S' =3. L' is D=2. So S'=3, L'=2.

Emitted particle: p (proton). Intrinsic parity of proton is +1, I think. Wait, wait, the problem says the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So if X is a proton, but p has parity +1. Wait, no, the problem says X has parity -1. So in this case, X is a neutron? Or maybe the particle is a meson? Wait, the options have 'p', 'f', 's', etc. Wait, 'p' is proton, 'f' could be a neutron? Or perhaps it's the type of meson. Hmm, perhaps the particle is a pion. Wait, pion has parity -1. So in the options, the emitted particle could be a pion, so the letter denotes the type.

Wait, the options denote the particle as p, s, etc. Maybe 'p' stands for proton, but earlier the problem states that X has intrinsic parity -1, so X can't be a proton. Because proton has parity +1. So perhaps the letters denote something else.

Wait, perhaps 'p' stands for a particle with angular momentum p state, which is l=1. Wait, but in the options, the particle is labeled as p, f, s, etc. Maybe 'p' is the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle. For example, 'p' would mean l=1, 's' l=0, 'f' l=3, etc.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: ... +p → probably l=1.

Option B: ... +p → l=1.

Option C: ... +f → l=3.

Option D: ... +s → l=0.

Yes, that makes sense because in spectroscopic notation, s is l=0, p l=1, d l=2, f l=3, etc.

So the particle X is emitted with orbital angular momentum l. But wait, the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So regardless of the emitted orbital angular momentum, the parity of X is fixed as -1.

So for each option, the emitted particle's l is given by the lowercase letter. For example, option D's emitted particle is 's', which is l=0.

Let me go back. For each option, I need to:

1. Determine l (emitted particle's orbital angular momentum), which is given by the lowercase letter (p→1, s→0, f→3, etc.).

2. Compute the parity condition: L + L' +1 must be even.

3. Compute the Pauli condition: S' + L' must be odd.

Where L is the emitted particle's l, L' is the NN's orbital angular momentum in the final state, and S' is the NN's spin in the final state.

Wait, but L is the emission's orbital angular momentum, which is the same as the partial wave, and L' is the NN's orbital angular momentum after emission.

So, for each option:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

p is 'p' → l=1.

Final state of NN: 7D1 → S'= (7-1)/2 =3. L'=2.

So S' =3, L'=2.

Compute the Pauli condition: T=0 = S' + L' +1 mod2.

S' + L' =3+2=5 → 5 mod2 =1. 1 +1 =2 → 0 mod2. So T=0, which matches. So condition satisfied.

Now, parity condition: L + L' +1 must be even.

L=1 (emitted l), L'=2.

1+2+1=4 → even. So parity condition is satisfied.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p.

3S1 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L' is S=0? Wait, the term is 3S1. So (2S' +1)L' J' =3 S 1.

Wait, term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 3S1 → S=1, L=0 (since S is the spectroscopic symbol for S orbital, which is l=0), J=1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2*0+1)S0 → 1S0, which implies L=0.

So the final NN state is 3S1: S'=1, L'=0.

Emitted particle is p → l=1.

So, parity condition: L + L' +1 =1+0+1=2 → even. So parity is satisfied.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =1 +0=1. So 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. Correct. So T=0, which is given.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f.

3D3 → (2S' +1)=3 → S'=1. L'=D=2. J'=3. So S'=1, L'=2.

Emitted particle is f → l=3.

Parity condition: L + L' +1 =3 +2 +1 =6 → even. So parity condition holds.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =1 +2=3 → 1 mod2. 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So condition holds.

Thus, option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

3P0 → (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1. L'=P=1.

Emitted particle is s → l=0.

Parity condition: L=0, L'=1.

0+1+1=2 → even. So parity condition holds.

Pauli condition: S' + L' =1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So 0+1=1 → which mod2 is 1. So 0=1 mod2? No, wait the condition is T=0= S' + L' +1 mod2.

Wait, wait, the condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2.

Wait no, earlier I thought the condition was T= S' + L' +1 mod2. Because the problem statement says: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod2). So T= S' + L' +1 mod2.

Wait, earlier, I thought the equation was 0 ≡ S' + L' +1 mod2, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, problem says T = S + L +1 mod2. So for T=0, 0 = S' + L' +1 mod2.

So, 0 ≡ (S' + L' +1) mod2 → S' + L' ≡ 1 mod2.

So in option D:

S'=1, L'=1. So 1 +1=2 → 0 mod2. 0 +1=1 → 1 mod2. So T would be 1, but the problem states T=0. So this condition is not satisfied. Therefore, option D's final state would violate the Pauli condition.

Wait, let me double-check.

Option D: 3P0 → S'=1, L'=1.

So S' + L' =2 → mod2 is 0. Then, 0 +1=1 → mod2 is 1. So T would be 1, but the problem requires T=0. So this violates the condition, making option D impossible.

Wait, but I thought earlier that for option D, the parity condition holds. So the parity condition is satisfied, but the Pauli condition is violated. Therefore, option D is not allowed.

Wait, but I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through the Pauli condition again.

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

In the final state, T=0. So 0 ≡ S' + L' +1 mod2.

So, S' + L' +1 ≡0 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

In option D, S'=1, L'=1. So 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. 0 +1=1 → mod2 is 1. So T=1, which doesn't match the required T=0. So this option violates the condition, meaning it's not allowed.

So which option is not permitted? The question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the one that doesn't satisfy either parity or Pauli condition.

Looking back:

Option D fails the Pauli condition, so it's not permitted. So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), where \( T(NN) = 0 \). The initial state is \( 1S_0 \), meaning \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\). For each option, we calculate the parity and Pauli conditions to determine if they are satisfied.
