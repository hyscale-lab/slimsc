Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in several organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them exhibit optical activity. Then, choose the correct option (A to D) as the answer.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers, which means it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it won't be chiral, so no optical activity.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Structure: The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and double bond to C2. C2 has a methyl group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So, the structure is Cl attached to C1 (which is double bonded to C2). So, C1 has CHCl, double bond to C2, which has CH(CH3) and another CH2? Wait, maybe I should write the structure:

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl at C1, making it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but it's 1-chloro-2
