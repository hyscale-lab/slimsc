Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. Wait, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. The substituents are at position 2,2, so the structure is probably something like this: the oxygen is attached to carbon 1 of a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbon? Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituents are on the second carbon, right? So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, so positions are 1, 2, 3,4, with double bond between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-something? Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- but no, wait. Let me write it out.

The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at position 3. Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-? No, wait. Wait, the structure in but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-C=CH2? Because for butene, the double bond is at position 1 or 2. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would imply the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, which is impossible because butene is four carbons, so the maximum position is 2
