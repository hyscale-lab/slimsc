Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistical mechanics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Right, so each spin S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I should list all possible states and compute E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all states.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So adding three of them gives a sum that can vary.

Wait, let's see: each term S_i S_j is either 1 or -1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3? Because if all three are 1, sum is 3. If two are 1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is 1 and two are -1, sum is -1. If all three are -1, sum is -3.

So the possible energy values are E = -J * sum. So when sum is 3, E is -3J. Sum 1, E is -J. Sum -1, E is J. Sum -3, E is 3J.

Wait, wait! Wait a second. The energy is E = -J [ ... ] So if the sum inside is positive, E is negative, and vice versa.

So let me think about how many states give each sum. Let me see:

Case 1: All three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are 1. That means all pairs are same. So, for this to happen, all three spins must be the same. Because S_i S_j =1 implies S_i = S_j. So either all +1 or all -1.

So how many states have all same spins? Two states: all +1, all -1.

In this case, sum is 3. So E = -3J.

Case 2: Two products are 1, one is -1. So the sum is 1.

But how many ways can this happen? Let me see. Let's think about the possible states. If two products are 1 and one is -1, that could happen in different ways.

Wait, another approach: for each state, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. So I can find the number of states that give each sum.

Alternatively, since each of the three terms S_i S_j can be either 1 or -1, the sum is a sum of three ±1 terms. The number of states with sum S is equal to the number of ways to choose (3 + S)/2 terms as +1 and (3 - S)/2 as -1. But wait, this might not be the right approach because each term isn't independent. Because S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 are not independent variables. They are related through the spin values.

Ah, right, because S1, S2, S3 determine all the products. So maybe it's better to think in terms of the spin states.

Each spin is ±1. Let's consider all possible combinations.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the number of states for each possible sum.

Let me think about the sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is S_i S_j. Let me compute H for all possible spin configurations.

There are 8 possible states:

1. S1=1, S2=1, S3=1
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 = 3.

2. S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1
   H = 1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) = 1 -1 -1= -1.

3. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1
   H = 1*(-1) + 1*(1) + (-1)*1 = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1
   H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   H = (-1)(-1)+ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1+1+1=3.

Wait, so looking at the 8 states: states 1 and 8 have H=3. States 2-7 have H=-1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me recompute some of these.

Wait, state 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.

State3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1. Correct.

State5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

State8: all -1: H=3.

So in the 8 states, two have H=3, and the other six have H=-1.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because when I look at state2, H=-1. State3, H=-1. State4, H=-1. State5, H=-1. State6, H=-1. State7, H=-1. So of the 8 possible states, 6 have H=-1, and 2 have H=3.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I count correctly?

Let me recount:

States with H=3: state1 (all +1) and state8 (all -1). So two states.

States with H=-1: the other six.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check another state. For example, suppose S1=1, S2=1, S3=1: H=3.

Another case: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: H=3.

Others:

Take S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. H=1*1 +1*(-1) +1*(-1) = 1-1-1= -1.

Another example: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1: H=-1 +1 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, but what about the case where all three are in a mixed state but not in all the same way. Like S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

H= (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

Wait, so in all six other cases, H is -1.

So in that case, the energies for these states are:

- For H=3: E = -J *3. So E = -3J.

- For H=-1: E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. E is given by -J(H), where H is the sum.

So E = -J*(H). So when H=3, E=-3J. When H=-1, E= J.

So each state with H=3 contributes exp(βE) = exp(β*(-3J)) = exp(-3Jβ).

Each state with H=-1 contributes exp(β*E) = exp( Jβ ).

So the partition function Z is sum_{all states} exp(β E).

Which is:

Number of states with H=3 * exp(-3Jβ) + Number of states with H=-1 * exp(Jβ).

Which is 2 * e^{-3 J β} + 6 * e^{ J β}.

So Z = 2e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}.

Looking at the options:

Option A is Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^{Jβ}.

Yes, that's what we got. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ). Yes.

So the answer is option A.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific configuration of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), and the energy \( E \) depends on the value of \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). The possible values of \( H \) are determined by the spin configurations:

1. **Case 1: All spins are the same**  
   - If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \), all pairwise products \( S_iS_j \) are \( +1 \), so \( H = 3 \).  
   - For these two states, the energy is \( E = -J \cdot 3 = -3J \).

2. **Case 2: At least one spin differs**  
   - In all other configurations, \( H = -1 \). This occurs because two of the pairwise products are \( +1 \) and one is \( -1 \), or vice versa.  
   - There are 6 such states, and the energy for these states is \( E = -J \cdot (-1) = J \).

Thus, the partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states, weighted by \( e^{-\beta E} \):

\[
Z = 2 \cdot e^{-3J\beta} + 6 \cdot e^{J\beta}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \).**

Answer: A
