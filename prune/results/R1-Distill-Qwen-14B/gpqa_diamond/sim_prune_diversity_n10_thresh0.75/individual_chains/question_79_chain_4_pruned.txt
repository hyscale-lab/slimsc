Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, let's see what I remember about NMR and epoxides.

The reaction involves Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature for a day. Wait, what's that reagent? Oh right, that's a typical catalyst for epoxide ring-opening reactions. But wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide that's being opened? Or is it something else?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is commonly known as DABCO. DABCO is a catalyst used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh wait, no, wait: DABCO is a base, and it's used in various reactions. Oh right, DABCO is used in the epoxidation of alkenes when using peracids. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, peracids like mCPBA are the ones that form epoxides. Wait, but DABCO is a base, so perhaps it's used in other reactions, maybe in ring-opening epoxide reactions, or in some kind of acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed processes.

Wait, so in this case, the reaction is with DABCO. Wait, another thought: sometimes DABCO is used as a catalyst for certain eliminations, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Let me think. If X is an alkene and is reacted with a peracid in presence of DABCO as a catalyst, it would form an epoxide. But wait, what's the product's NMR?

Alternatively, the product could be an epoxide. Looking at the options, they all are epoxides except maybe none. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane (epoxide) connected to a styryl group (a vinyl benzene) at position 4 with a methyl. So the structure would be like an epoxide ring with a substituent on one carbon, which is connected to a benzene ring at the 4 position with a methyl.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So oxirane with a propenyl group attached, with the phenyl on the same carbon as the double bond. So structure would be like epoxide where one oxygen is attached to CH2, and the other to a CH group which has a double bond to another CH that's connected to a phenyl. Hmm, maybe.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at positions 2 and 3, and there's a methyl on one of the carbons and a styryl (vinyl benzene) group on the other.

Wait, but wait, looking at the product's NMR. Let me see the 1H NMR data:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Those are likely methyl groups attached to something deshielded but not near any protons, hence singlets. So maybe two methyl groups attached to carbons that don't have neighboring Hs.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.7
