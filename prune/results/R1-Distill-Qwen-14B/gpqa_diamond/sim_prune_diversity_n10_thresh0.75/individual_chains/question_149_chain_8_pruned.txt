Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was synthesized. The 1H NMR shows something unexpected: two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrate to 1H together. So they're probably not due to splitting from other protons because the coupling is ruled out. Also, the LC-MS of the crude compound has two peaks with the same mass. Hmm.

So what's going on here? Let's think about possible explanations.

First, the NMR part. Two peaks for the same proton. Since it's the same alpha-proton, maybe they're from different environments. But why two? If it's a diastereomer, the environment would be different, so the protons would split into different peaks. But if the molecule is a racemic mixture, then for an alpha-proton that's not involved in the stereocenter, maybe it would be the same. Wait, but if the alpha carbon is a stereocenter, then in enantiomers, the proton environments would be mirrored, so the chemical shifts would be the same. So NMR wouldn't see a difference, right? So in an enantiomer mixture, you wouldn't get separate peaks for the same proton because their shifts are identical. But if the molecule has diastereomers, like diastereomeric impurities, then their alpha-protons might have different shifts. But wait, in this case, the integrals add up to 1H, which is expected, so maybe the two peaks are each 0.5H or something. 

Wait, but the problem says the NMR shows two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. So that's confusing. If the same proton is split into two, but the integration adds up to 1H. So perhaps it's split into a doublet, but that would be from coupling to another proton. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So it's not coupling to another proton. Hmm.

Another thought. Maybe the compound exists as a pair of enantiomers. But wait, in that case, the NMR would show the same peaks, so
