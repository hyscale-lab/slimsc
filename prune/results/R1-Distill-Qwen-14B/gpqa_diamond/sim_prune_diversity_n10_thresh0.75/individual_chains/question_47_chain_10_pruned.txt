Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2, and the options are four different organic compounds. Let's break this down.

First, the IR spectrum. The peaks are given at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, both medium to strong. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has both N and O in the formula, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine or an alcohol. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Wait, amides typically show a carbonyl around 1650-1700, but esters are around 1740-1720. Hmm, but wait, 1720 is right in the middle. Could be either.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: Here's what I see. 

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet integrating for 3H suggests it's the end of an ethyl chain (since the neighboring CH2 would split into a triplet).

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH group, but wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's not NH. Alternatively, maybe an -OCH2- group? Or something else.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H. That's likely a CH2 that's next to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 near the oxygen would be a quartet. Like OCH2CH2something? Or if it's part of an ester group, like OCH2CH3, but in that case, the quartet would be at lower ppm, maybe around 4.1 or similar. Wait, in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually a quartet around 4.1, and the CH2CH3 is a triplet around 1.2. So this 4.5 could be an adjacent CH2, maybe attached to an oxygen. Or perhaps it's a neighboring group to another CH2.

- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. 

- 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H.

The aromatic region shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substitution, the protons are usually split into two doublets, each with two H's. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. So benzamide would have a CONH2 group. Wait, benzamide structure is benzene with a CONH2 group. But in the formula here, the substituents would be ethoxy and amide groups. However, 3-ethoxy would mean it's in the meta position, but the NMR shows para substitution. So if the substituents are ethoxy and CONH2, their positions would determine the splitting. If they are meta, the protons would split differently. Wait, but in this case, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which suggests two substituents opposite each other, like para. So if the benzene has two substituents in para positions, then maybe one is ethoxy and the other
