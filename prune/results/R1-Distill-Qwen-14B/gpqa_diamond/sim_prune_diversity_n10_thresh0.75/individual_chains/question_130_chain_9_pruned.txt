Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects using optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And the task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, so Lyman alpha is a specific emission or absorption line. I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet range. The Lyman series transitions are from higher energy levels to the first energy level (n=1) of hydrogen. Lyman alpha is the transition from n=2 to n=1, right? So the rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers, in the far UV.

Now, when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But wait, when the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, the absorption line would be in the optical range? Or the other way around? Wait, no, the quasar is the background object, so the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which causes absorption at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but then due to the cloud's redshift, that wavelength gets shifted.

So the observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest (1216 Angstroms) by the redshift z: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z).

But for us to detect this absorption in optical wavelengths, λ_obs must be in the optical range. Optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, the Lyman alpha absorption line must be shifted into the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So we need the smallest z where the absorption is still in optical.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. Let's see, if the observed wavelength is just in the optical, say the lower end, maybe 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So λ_obs = 4000 Angstroms. Then, z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

Calculating that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. So if the redshift is higher than approximately 2.29, the observed wavelength would be longer than 4000 Angstroms, i.e., in the optical. Wait, but that's the calculation for the lower limit? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the object (the hydrogen cloud) is at a redshift z, then any light it emits or absorbs is shifted by that. The quasar's light that passes through the cloud would have its Lyman alpha absorption line shifted by z. So for us to observe that absorption line in the optical (say, visible light), the wavelength after shift must be in 400-700 nm.

So the Lyman alpha line is 1216 Angstroms (0.1216 nm). If the cloud has a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 0.1216*(1+z) nm. We want this to be less than about 0.7 nm (7000 Angstroms?), no wait, wait. No, wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. No, wait, 1 nm = 10 A? No, wait 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm.

Wait, no. Wait, no
