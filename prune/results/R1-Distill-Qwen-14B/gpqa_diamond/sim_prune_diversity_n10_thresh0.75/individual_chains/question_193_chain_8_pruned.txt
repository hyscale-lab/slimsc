Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are given as different powers of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Like, parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance d in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx. But wait, the question gives N proportional to 1/plx^5. So substituting plx in terms of d, 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5, since (1/plx)^5 is (d)^5 because plx = 1/d. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, that's the change in N per change in r. So maybe I need to find the derivative of N with respect to r, or think in terms of how N increases as r increases.

Wait, N is proportional to r^5? Because d is the same as r, I think. So if N = k * r^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the question is about the change with respect to distanceâ€”so perhaps the rate at which the number of stars increases.

But wait, the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So maybe they want the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, more stars are observed, but the rate of increase is r^5.

Wait, but the question is about per unit range of distance. Maybe it's more about the differential change. So if you have a small change in r, how does N change? That would involve taking the derivative.

So N is proportional to r^5. Let's say N = C * r^5, where C
