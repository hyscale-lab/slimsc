Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r². And it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates. I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. I remember that divergence is a measure of a vector field's tendency to originate from or converge to a particular point. So, calculating the divergence of f and then integrating it over the volume of the sphere should give me some result.

Wait, but wait. Oh right! There's the Divergence Theorem. That's the thing that relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the field itself over the boundary of the volume. Oh right, so that's probably going to come into play here.

The Divergence Theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S (the boundary of V). So, ∫∫∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∫∫_S f · n dS, where n is the outward unit normal vector of the surface.

So in this case, since the sphere is our volume, the surface S is the sphere of radius R. The vector field f has only a radial component, so f · n would just be the radial component of f multiplied by the magnitude of n. But since n is a unit vector, it's just the radial component of f.

Wait, let's get more precise. In spherical coordinates, the unit normal vector n is in the radial direction, so f · n is just the radial component of the field. The field is given as f(r) = 1/r², but wait, is that the magnitude? Oh yes, the magnitude of the vector field is 1/r², and it's along the radial direction. So the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector.

So, the flux integral becomes the integral over the surface S of f · n dS. Since f is radial and n is radial, their dot product is just f(r) times the magnitude of n (which is 1). So f · n = (1/r²) * r̂ · r̂ = 1/r².

Wait, but wait, what's r in this context? On the surface S, which is radius R, so r is exactly R. So f · n is (1/R²) * R²? Wait no, no. Wait, no. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. The magnitude of the field is 1/r², so the radial component of the vector field is (1/r²) * r̂. So when r = R (on the surface), the component is 1/R².

But wait, the surface area element dS in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ.
