Okay, I need to figure out this physics problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The distance they can travel before decaying is related to their lifetime and speed.

Wait, right! The proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) is gamma times shorter than the lab frame lifetime. Oh wait, no, wait. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Because from the lab's perspective, the particle's clock is ticking slower.

So, the particles are produced at the center and move outward. The time it takes them to reach the detector's inner wall is the distance divided by their speed. But since they're moving at relativistic speeds, we need to consider their speed in terms of the speed of light.

Wait, the problem says they're ultra-relativistic, so I can approximate their speed as the speed of light. So, the time to reach the detector is t = R / (v), but since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c). But wait, R is 30 meters. Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. So the time to reach the wall is 1e-7 seconds.

But wait, in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So the condition is that the proper lifetime tau must be such that a fraction of the particles decay before reaching the wall.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the particles' decay length. The decay length L is c * gamma * tau. If L is greater than or equal to the detector radius R, then a significant fraction of the particles will reach the detector walls.

Wait, but the problem says that for a Lorentz factor of 20, one third reach the inner walls. So I need to find the Lorentz factor where two-thirds reach the walls. That probably relates to the ratio of lifetimes or something.

Wait, another approach. The number of particles that decay before reaching the wall is determined by the probability that their lifetime is less than the time it takes to reach the wall. The probability that a particle decays in time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is the lab frame lifetime. But tau_lab is gamma times tau (proper time). So t is the time to reach the detector.

So, the probability that the particle decays (and thus does not reach the wall) is P_decay = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma * tau)).

Wait, but the question says that on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So the survival probability is 1/3. That would mean that the decay probability is 2/3.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the survival probability is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall. So, the survival probability S is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, for the initial case, when gamma is 20, S_initial = 1/3. So 1/3 = exp( - t/(20 tau) )

We can solve for t/(20 tau): ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau)

So, t/(20 tau) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

So, t = 20 tau * ln(3)

Wait, now when we want S_new = 2/3. So,

2/3 = exp( -t/(gamma_new tau) )

Take natural log: ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau )

So, t/(gamma_new tau) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

But from the initial case, t = 20 tau * ln(3). Let's substitute that into the second equation.

So:

(20 tau * ln(3)) / (gamma_new tau) )= ln(3/2)

Simplify: 20 ln(3) / gamma_new = ln(3/2)

So, gamma_new = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Compute the values:

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma_new ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.707 ≈ 54.14

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So that would be the answer.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability and the Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( S \) is given by:

\[
S = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Time to reach the detector wall
The detector has a radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \), and the particles are traveling at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their speed can be approximated as the speed of light \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). The time to reach the wall is:

\[
t = \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Survival probability for \( \gamma = 20 \)
For the initial case, when \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third of the particles survive to reach the wall. Thus, the survival probability is \( S = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{20 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Step 3: Survival probability for two-thirds of particles
We now require that two-thirds of the particles survive, so \( S = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
-\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \)
From Step 2, \( t = 20 \tau \ln(3) \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{20 \tau \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_{\text{new}}} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Solve for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical calculation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} \approx \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.14.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The closest option to \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \approx 54.14 \) is **54**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
