Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The question gives me six stars (a to f) and I need to determine how many are detectable based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

Hmm, first, I should understand what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for studying exoplanets and other astrophysical phenomena. It's mounted on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Chile. High resolution implies it can observe very faint objects because it can collect a lot of light.

The key factor here is the signal-to-noise ratio. A higher S/N means the object is brighter and easier to detect. The question specifies S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel. So I need to figure out for each star whether their brightness (as seen from Earth) allows ESPRESSO to achieve this S/N in an hour.

I think the brightness of a star as seen from Earth is given by its apparent magnitude. So the apparent magnitude (m) would be important here. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. 

Wait, wait. No, the correct formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Because M is the absolute magnitude (apparent magnitude at 10 pc), so for a star at distance d (pc), the apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Alternatively, it can be written as m = M + 5 (log10 d -1).

So for each star, I can compute m.

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can find the flux, since the S/N depends on the flux. The S/N ratio is proportional to the square root of the flux. More flux means higher S/N.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me think. The S/N per pixel is proportional to the square root of the number of photons collected, which depends on the exposure time and the flux. So, higher flux (brighter star) gives higher S/N.

But for a given spectrograph, the noise is usually dominated by photon noise, so the S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time and the flux. Since the exposure is fixed at 1 hour, the S/N depends on the flux, which depends on the apparent brightness (m).

But I'm not exactly sure how to calculate the S/N. Maybe I can approach this by understanding the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO. What's the faintest star it can observe and still get an S/N of at least 10 in an hour?

Alternatively, perhaps each star's apparent magnitude determines whether it's bright enough. So I need to find each star's m, then see if it's within the detectable range of ESPRESSO under 1-hour exposure.

So let's compute the apparent magnitude for each star:

Star a) Canopus: I think Can
