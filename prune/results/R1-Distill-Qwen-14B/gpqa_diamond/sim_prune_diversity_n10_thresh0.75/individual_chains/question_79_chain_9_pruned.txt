Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

First, the question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X was.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Oh right, that's a common reagent used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. It's a strong, bulky base, often used to induce epoxide ring opening under specific conditions. So, I'm thinking the reaction here is probably opening an epoxide.

But the product's NMR is given, so perhaps the reaction is leading to some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the compound X is an epoxide, and this reaction is doing something else. Wait, wait. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used in the process of acid-catalyzed ring opening, but wait, no, actually, I think it's used in the base-induced ring opening, especially in what's known as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement when dealing with epoxides. So if X is an epoxide, reacting with this reagent might be causing a ring-opening via a hydride or alkyl shift.

Looking at the options, all options except D are substituted oxiranes (epoxides). Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is an epoxide adjacent to a styryl group. So X could be an epoxide, and the reaction could be causing some kind of shift or rearrangement.

The product's NMR is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

1H NMR:
Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, first, two singlets integrating to 3H each. Singlet means no neighboring protons
