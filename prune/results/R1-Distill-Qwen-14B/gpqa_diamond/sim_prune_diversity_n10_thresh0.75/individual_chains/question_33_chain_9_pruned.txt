Okay, so I have this cycloaddition reaction to figure out. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione when heated. I'm supposed to find the exo product from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions, especially Diels-Alder reactions, are [4+2] processes. The Diels-Alder reaction involves a diene and a dienophile. The diene is usually conjugated, and the dienophile is something electron-deficient.

Wait, the reactants here are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. Let me think about their structures. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur, right? 2,5-dimethylthiophene would have methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. So it's a conjugated diene because the double bonds are between 2-3 and 4-5 positions, if I'm not mistaken. So that's the diene part.

Furan-2,5-dione is another compound. Furan has two double bonds, so the 2 and 5 positions are the ketone groups. So it's O=C-O-C-O-C=O, but arranged in a furan ring. Wait, no, furan is a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. Furan-2,5-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So the structure is O=C-O-C-O-C(=O)-? No, wait, furan has four carbons and one oxygen. So positions 2 and 5 would be adjacent to the oxygen. So 2,5-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5, making it a good dienophile because of the electron-withdrawing groups (the ketones).

So the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene, and the dienophile is furan-2,5-dione. When they undergo a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (electron-rich) reacts with the dienophile (electron-poor) under heat.

Wait, but I thought Diels-Alder is typically between a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Thiophene is aromatic
