Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a certain reaction. Let's break it down.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. So, cyclohexene implies a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 5.

Wait, the substituents are a formyl group at position 2, a vinyl group at position 5, and the ring has a double bond at position 3, I think. So, the parent ring is cyclohexene, and the substituents are attached.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Another thought: when you have a compound with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HI and P? Oh, maybe it's a halogenation or something else. Wait, wait, no, another reaction comes to mind. Oh! It's the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups by replacing them with methylene groups using heat and ammonia. But wait, red phosphorus and HI—maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg, but red phosphorus is a different setup. Oh wait, another possibility: Maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine? No, the starting material isn't a nitrile. Wait, the starting material has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI—I think they are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but maybe in this case, it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that converts alkenes or alkynes. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2CH2, or more accurately, a CH2 connected to a double bond). So, 2-formyl is a CHO group attached to the cyclohexene ring at position 2, and 5-vinyl is a CH2CH2 group attached at position 5. The
