Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, isn't that a bit unclear? Oh, maybe it's more like L = λ ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I'm not sure. Oh, wait, perhaps it's better to parse it as L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, not entirely clear, but maybe the exact form isn't critical right now. The important thing is that X interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, the rest mass of the boson must be equal to or greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Here's a quick list I remember:

- Electron (e⁻): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻): around 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV (but since quarks are confined, maybe we're considering their constituent mass? Or perhaps in this context, considering their current algebra masses? Hmm, but in any case, this is way less than 6 GeV)
Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. No, wait, the masses are for the particles. So for quarks, the current masses are:

- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV (so 0.002-0.005 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4-8 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-105 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (but that's way above 6 GeV)
Wait, but top quarks are super heavy, so X can't decay into top quarks because 6 GeV is way less than 173 GeV.

Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for it to decay into a pair of fermions f and \bar{f}, the mass of each f must be less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 2m_f ≤ m_X).

Looking at the fermion masses, let's list them in GeV:

- e⁻: ~0.0005 GeV
- μ⁻: ~0.105 GeV
- τ⁻: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~0.005 GeV (assuming 5 MeV)
- d: ~0.008 GeV (8 MeV)
- s: ~0.10 GeV (100 MeV)
- c: ~1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.7 GeV
- t: ~173 GeV

So for each fermion pair, we need 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at each fermion:

- e: yes, 0.0005 < 3 GeV. So X → e+ e- is allowed.
- μ: 0.105 <3 → allowed. So μ+ μ- is possible.
- τ: 1.78 <3 → allowed. So τ+ τ- is possible.
- u: 0.005 <3 → allowed. u u-bar.
- d: 0.008 <3 → allowed. d d-bar.
- s: 0.10 <3 → allowed. s s-bar.
- c: 1.5 <3 → allowed. c c-bar.
- b: 4.7 >3 → Not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.
- t: way too heavy, so no.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV. So e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, b has mass ~4.7 GeV. So 2m_b = ~9.4 GeV >6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar
