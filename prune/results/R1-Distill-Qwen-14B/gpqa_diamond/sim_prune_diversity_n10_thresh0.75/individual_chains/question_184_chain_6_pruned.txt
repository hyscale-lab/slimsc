Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A, B, C, or D.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy (-OCH2CH3), position 2 is tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 is nitro (-NO2). Wait, actually, wait: benzene is a ring, so numbering would be such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So positions 1, 2, 3 have substituents in that order. So the ring has substituents in a meta arrangement? Let me think: position 1 (ethoxy), position 2 (tert-butyl), and position 3 (nitro). So they're adjacentâ€”so maybe the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they're all next to each other. I'm a bit confused about the numbering, but I think the key is that the substituents are in specific positions relative to each other.

So, starting from benzene, I'll need to perform several electrophilic substitution reactions. The problem is figuring out the order of adding these substituents because activating and deactivating groups can influence where new groups attach.

Benzene is a good starting point. Let's think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3): This is a strong activating group (ortho/para-directing).
2. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3): Alkyl groups are activating (but bulky) and are also ortho/para-directing.
3. Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So if I add that early, it might deactivate the ring, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, if I add activating groups first, maybe that's better.

Wait, the target molecule has both activating and deactivating groups. Let's think about the order of substitution. Since nitro is deactivating, it's probably best to add it last because once the ring is deactivated, adding other groups might be difficult. But wait, ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, so perhaps they are added before nitro. But wait, I have to consider the directing effects.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So if I add it after adding one substituent, the next substitution would be in the meta position relative to nitro. Alternatively, maybe nitro is added after other groups. Hmm.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. Let me think about the possible steps. Let's break it down
