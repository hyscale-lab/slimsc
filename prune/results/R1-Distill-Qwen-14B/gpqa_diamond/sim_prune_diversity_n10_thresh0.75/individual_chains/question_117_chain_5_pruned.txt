Okay, I need to figure out which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's break down each option one by one.

The question lists four compounds, numbered 1 to 4. I'll go through each and determine if they can have stereoisomers due to chirality.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Let me visualize this structure. It's a biphenyl group (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each of the two carboxylic acid groups (as esters, since it's -ate) is at position 2, and the nitro groups are at position 6. The substituents are symmetrical on each ring. Wait, but the connection between the two phenyl rings is in position 1, making it a 1,1'-biphenyl. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So the structure might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but if the substituents are on both rings in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical, maybe there's a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe it's about the biphenyl itself causing some kind of isomerism. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but are they chiral? Well, if the biphenyl has two different groups on each side and lacks a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. But in this case, each ring has two substituents (the ester groups and nitro groups). Wait, the molecule is symmetrical because both rings have the same substituents in the same positions. So, perhaps it can't have optical isomers because it's symmetrical. Or maybe not, if the substituents cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system itself isn't chiral, but perhaps the ester groups are attached in a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, each ester group is attached at position 2 on each benzene. Each ester is a methyl
