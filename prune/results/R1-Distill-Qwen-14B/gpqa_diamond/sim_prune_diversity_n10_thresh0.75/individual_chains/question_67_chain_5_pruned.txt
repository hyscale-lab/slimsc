Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means. 

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1. The problem is about the coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

I remember that in angular momentum coupling, l1 and l2 are the individual angular momenta of each particle, and l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. So here, each electron has l=1, and when combined, the total l is 2. The m value is -1, which is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So we're looking for P(L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ).

First, I need to understand the state |1,1,2,-1>. Since the electrons are in a coupled state, their total angular momentum is the sum of their individual angular momenta. Each electron's l is 1, so possible total l values can be |1-1| to 1+1, which is 0,1,2. Here, the coupled state is l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but the state is given in terms of the coupled basis, which is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum and M is its z-component. But the question is about measuring L1z and L2z, which are the individual z-components, not the total.

So, to find the probabilities of individual measurements, I probably need to express the coupled state in terms of the product basis states of individual angular momenta. The product basis states would be |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, where m1 is the z-component of the first electron, and m2 the second.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. When you have a state |l1, l2, L, M>, it can be expressed as a combination of |l1, m1>|l2, m2>
