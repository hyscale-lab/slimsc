Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed in a previous period. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows some exponential law, right?

So, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That probably means the probability of decay after 100 minutes is 32%, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no, actually, I think the decay probability over a time period relates to the decay constant. Or maybe it's the cumulative probability. Let me think.

I think the decay constant, lambda, is a key here. The formula for the probability of decay is N = N0 * e^(-lambda * t). The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-lambda t). So if 32% have decayed by 100 minutes, that means 0.32 = 1 - e^(-lambda * 100). So, e^(-lambda *100) = 0.68. Taking natural logs, -lambda *100 = ln(0.68), so lambda = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me calculate that. Ln(0.68) is approximately... ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit smaller than 0.7, so maybe around -0.385. So lambda is about 0.385 / 100, which is 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the question says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So the time left is 150 minutes. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes? Or after the 50 minutes, another 150? Oh, I think it's the next 150 minutes. So the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes from the start. But wait, since 50 have already passed, we're looking at the decay probability from time 50 to 50+150 = 200.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The initial 100 minutes is the time for 32% decay. The current time is 50 minutes, and we're asked about the next 150 minutes. So perhaps we need to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Ah, right! So conditional probability. So it's the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes.

The formula for conditional probability in decay is that the probability of decay in a subsequent time interval, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as the probability of decay in that interval starting from time zero. Because radioactive decay is memoryless. Oh right, that's the key! The exponential distribution has the memoryless property. So the probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed, is 1 - e^(-lambda * t).

Wait, but in this case, our time t is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-lambda*150). Oh wait, but wait another thing. The given decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes is the cumulative probability. So that gives us lambda, which we can then use to find the 150 minute probability.

But wait, maybe I should re-express this. Let me restate the given information. The decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So the cumulative probability P(t=100) = 0.3
