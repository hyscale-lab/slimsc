Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. And the value of B is 1 Tesla. They're asking about the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is around the Lyman series or maybe the Balmer series? Wait, 0.486 micrometers is actually the wavelength for the Balmer-alpha line, which is the H-alpha emission line. So that corresponds to a specific energy transition in hydrogen.

So I need to find the energies involved here. Let's get the transition energy ΔE first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. 

Calculating that: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. 

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.0e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let me compute that.

Multiply 6.626e-34 by 3e8: 6.626 * 3 = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m. So 19.878e-26 / 0.4861e-6 = (19.878 / 0.4861) * 1e-20. Let me calculate 19.878 / 0.4861. 

0.4861 is roughly 0.486, so 19.878 / 0.486 ≈ 40.9. So 40.9e-20 J. That's 4.09e-19 J. Wait, but I should double-check the exponents. 1e-26 divided by 1e-6 gives 1e-20. So yes, 40.9e-20 is 4.09e-19 J. 

Wait, but hydrogen's energy levels are usually on the order of eV. I know 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 4.09e-19 J is roughly 2.56 eV. Does that make sense? Because the Lyman series is higher energy (like 10 eV and up) and Balmer is lower. H-alpha is 3.0 eV approximately. Hmm, my calculation gives about 2.56 eV. Maybe I made a small error in constants or approximation, but it's around a few eV.

Now, the other part is the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction of the magnetic moment of electrons with an external magnetic field. The energy term for this is given by the Zeeman effect, which is ΔE_mag = μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin quantum number.

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh, wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, and m is its z-component, so m can be from -l to +l. But for the orbital magnetic moment, the energy shift would be ΔE = -μ_B * m * B. But wait, orbital magnetic moment is smaller than spin. Because the Bohr magneton is about 9.27e-24 J/T, and the spin magneton is about 5.05e-27 J/T? Wait, no, wait: the Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B / 2, where g_s is about 2, so μ_s ≈ μ_B, so maybe 5e-24 J/T? Wait, no, wait: let me clarify.

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (μ_B) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number (m can be -l, ..., +l). For a given l, the maximum m is l. But in this question, it says small values of m. Hmm, so maybe m is small, like m=0, 1, etc. So the orbital contribution would be proportional to m. But if m is small, the orbital term could be small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spin-orbit coupling. Wait, but the question specifically says "paramagnetic coupling term", which refers to the interaction of the magnetic field with the electron's magnetic moment. So that would be the Zeeman effect term. So for each electron, this would be proportional to their magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

In hydrogen, the ground state has l=0 (s orbital), so m=0. So the orbital magnetic moment is zero. The spin magnetic moment is
