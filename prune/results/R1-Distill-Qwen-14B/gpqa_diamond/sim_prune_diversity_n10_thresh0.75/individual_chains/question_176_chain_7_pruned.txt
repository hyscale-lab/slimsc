Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, hold on—when I look closer, it's (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3-dimensional vector because each component is in a different row. But wait, is that the correct state vector? Because usually, quantum states are represented as column vectors with complex numbers, but in this case, it's given as real numbers. Hmm, maybe that's okay for the sake of the problem.

Next, we have two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as 3x3 matrices. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And the matrix for Q is:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

So, Q is a diagonal matrix. That should make things a bit easier because diagonal matrices have eigenvalues on the diagonal, and their eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, I think.

The question is about measuring P and then Q. Wait, no, the measurements are done in sequence: first P is measured, then Q is measured. But wait, the question is specifically about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, we need to find the probability that when we measure P first, we get 0, and then when we measure Q, we get -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So, if we first measure P, the state will collapse into an eigenstate of P. Then, when we measure Q, the state is in that eigenstate of P, so we have to see what the possible outcomes are for Q in that state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by first finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P, figure out which eigenstate corresponds to the eigenvalue 0, and then see what the state is after the measurement of P (i.e., the state collapses to that eigenstate). Then, compute the probability of measuring Q to be -1 in that state.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to compute the probability that the initial state, when measured in P, gives 0, and then, given that, the state is projected onto the eigenspace of P=0. Then, from that state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

So, let's break it down:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. We're interested in the eigenvalue 0 because we want the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

2. Find the probability that the initial state is in the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

3. Then, given that the state has collapsed into that eigenspace, find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Wait, but to start, let's find the eigenvalues of P. So, P is the matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Let's denote it as P.

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

| -λ        1/√2        0      |
|1/√2      -λ        1/√2     |
| 0        1/√2      -λ       |

The determinant can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me try expanding along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] 
- (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ]
+ 0 * ... (so third term is zero)

So, compute the first two terms.

First minor determinant (for -λ term):

det [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] = (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2)

Second minor determinant (for 1/√2 term):

det [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] = (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2

So putting it all together, the determinant is:

-λ [ λ² - 1/2 ] - (1/√2) [ -λ/√2 ]

Simplify:

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2) )

Because (1/√2)(-λ/√2) is -λ/(2), but when multiplied by -1 (from the cofactor), it becomes + lambda/(2).

Wait, let's compute each part carefully.

First term: -λ*(lambda squared - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ -λ/√2 ] = (1/√2)(λ/√2) ) = λ/(2)

So the determinant is:

(-lambda^3 + (lambda/2)) + (lambda/2) ) = -lambda^3 + lambda/2 + lambda/2 =

- lambda^3 + lambda.

So setting determinant to zero:

- lambda^3 + lambda = 0 → lambda ( -lambda^2 + 1 ) = 0 → lambda (1 - lambda^2 ) = 0.

So eigenvalues are lambda = 0, lambda = 1, lambda = -1.

Ah, so the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, so 0 is an eigenvalue, which is good because that's what we're interested in.

So, the eigenspace for P=0 is the set of vectors v where P v = 0.

So, to find the eigenvectors for lambda=0, we solve (P - 0 I)
