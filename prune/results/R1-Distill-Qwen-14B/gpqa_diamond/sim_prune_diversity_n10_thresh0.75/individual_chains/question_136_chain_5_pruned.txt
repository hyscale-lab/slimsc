Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The problem says that a vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Its magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, right. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. So, the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates might be different from Cartesian, but the basic concept remains the same.

Since the field only has a radial component, that should simplify things. Let me recall the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field F = F_r r̂ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) [d(r² F_r)/dr + r sinθ d(F_θ)/dθ + r d(F_φ)/dφ]. But in this case, F_θ and F_φ are zero because the field has only the radial component. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) * d(r² F_r)/dr.

Right, so F_r is given as 1/r². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the magnitude of f(r) is 1/r² and the field has non-zero component only along the radial direction. So the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. Because in spherical coordinates, the unit vector r̂ is in the radial direction.

So F_r = 1/r². So substituting into the divergence formula, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Let me compute that. Let's compute r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative with respect to r is d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, that's zero everywhere except maybe at the origin.

Wait, but wait. Because at r=0, the field isn't defined, right? Because as r approaches zero, the
