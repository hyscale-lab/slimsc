Okay, so I have this question about quasars and their spectra, and I need to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let me think through this.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. I remember that when we observe distant objects, their light gets redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So, if there's a peak at 790 nm, but the flux drops below that, maybe the original emission was in the optical range, but it's been redshifted into the near infrared. Like, perhaps the emission line is moving from optical to infrared because of the quasar's distance.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me try to recall. In the rest frame of the quasar, the emission lines are probably in the optical. Suppose there's a prominent emission line at, say, 500 nm (green region). If it's observed at 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z. The formula for redshift is observed wavelength 位_obs = 位_emitted * (1 + z). So, z = (位_obs / 位_emitted) - 1.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the emitted wavelength. Hmm. Maybe I should think about standard candles or something else. Oh wait, perhaps the peak at 790 nm is from a feature that's typically in the optical, like H-alpha line at about 656 nm. If that's the case, then the observed wavelength is longer, so z would be (790/656) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 divided by 656 is approximately 1.204. So z would be about 0.204. Is that right? So z is about 0.2.

Wait, but the question is about the comoving distance. Oh, right, comoving distance is a way to express the distance in the expanding universe. The comoving distance D_c is related to the redshift z through the integral of 1/(H(a) * a) da from a=1/(1+z) to a=1. But calculating that integral requires knowing the cosmological parameters.

The given cosmological
