Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm. So, the setup is about electron-positron annihilation. I remember that when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce gamma photons. But the problem says they produce two photons here.

Wait, why would they produce two photons? Oh right, because if they annihilate at rest, they produce two photons in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But in this case, the electron and positron are moving, so their momentum isn't zero. So the photons must carry off the total momentum.

Also, the problem states that the two photons have the same energy. So their energies are equal. And their directions are such that one is upper right and the other is lower right. So they're both moving to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards. So the angle between them would be, like, something more than 90 degrees maybe? Because one is up-right and the other is down-right.

But wait, the question is about the angle between the two photon directions. So if one is going upper-right and the other lower-right, they form a sort of V shape in the right direction. The angle between them would be the angle between their respective directions.

Wait, let's think about their momentum vectors. Because the photons have the same energy, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction if they were moving opposite. But in this case, both are moving to the right. So their momentum vectors are in the right direction but at different angles.

Wait, no. Wait, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So their momenta are vectors in those directions. Since photons move at the speed of light, their momentum direction is the same as their direction of motion.

So each photon's momentum is a vector pointing upper-right and lower-right. Let me denote their momenta as p1 and p2.

Since the energies are the same, and for photons E = |p|c, so their magnitudes are the same because their energies are equal. So |p1| = |p2|.

Because the photons are moving in opposite vertical directions but same horizontal direction, the angle between them would be the sum of their angles relative to the horizontal. Wait, but each has a certain angle above and below the horizontal.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this with vectors. Let me imagine a coordinate system where the horizontal axis is the x-axis, and vertical is y.

Photon 1 has a direction in the first quadrant (upper right), and photon 2 in the fourth quadrant (lower right). Let their angles relative to the x-axis be θ and -θ. Wait, no, that's only if they're symmetric. But in this case, they might not be symmetric because the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors.

Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So their magnitudes are the
