Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that Hamiltonians are related to the energy of a system, and their eigenvalues correspond to possible energy levels.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ is a vector made up of the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector in an arbitrary direction. So this must represent some spin system in a magnetic field pointing in the direction of n. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So when you take their dot product with a unit vector n, which has components (n_x, n_y, n_z), the expression becomes ε(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Right.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli spin matrix σ · n multiplied by a scalar are important in spin systems. So if I have a spin-1/2 particle, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Oh wait, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is proportional to σ · n. So the eigenvalues would be proportional to ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n.

Let me think about this. The eigenvalues of σ · n. Since σ is a vector of spin matrices, the operator σ · n is like the spin component in the direction of n. For a spin-1/2 system, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues would be ±1 multiplied by something?

Wait, let me get this straight. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, each with eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination of them, like σ · n, what are the eigenvalues? Oh, because n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Because the trace is zero and determinant is -1, so eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, no. Let me compute. The matrix σ ·
