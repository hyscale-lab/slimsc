Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some motion. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked.

So the question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, frames of reference. Oh right, this is a relativity problem maybe? But wait, the question says both are inertial frames. So this is probably about classical mechanics, not special relativity. Because if it were relativistic, the time would dilate, and the calculations would be more complicated.

Wait, but 60,000 km/s is way higher than the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s. Oh no, wait, 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, so it's a significant fraction. Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation and revolution, so maybe it's just a simple relative velocity problem.

Wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I think I need to use the concept of relative velocity between the two frames.

So let me think. The ejecta and the Galaxy are moving relative to each other. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in inertial frames, the relative velocity is the same but in opposite directions.

Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s. Because in inertial frames, the relative speed is the same when moving directly towards each other. So if the Galaxy is moving at v relative to the ejecta, then the ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy.

So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy's center.

Wait, but the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds. But wait, the 50 seconds are in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, but wait, if it's a classical mechanics problem, time is the same in both frames. Because in classical physics, different observers don't have time dilation. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds also pass in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the problem, I think I'm supposed to consider that the time experienced in each frame might be different, but maybe in this case, since it's a straightforward problem, they just want us to treat it as the same duration.

Wait, but wait again. If the frames are moving at a high speed relative to each other, like 60,000 km/s, then time dilation would occur. But the question doesn't specify to use relativity, and the options are in the millions of km, so perhaps it's intended as a classical problem.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s (since it's coming towards the center) or 60,000 km/s towards the center.

The problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so if the time is different between the frames, then I can't directly multiply speed by 50.

Ah, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time would be different due to time dilation. So I need to calculate the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but wait again. If the problem is using classical mechanics, then time is the same, so distance is just speed * time. But if it's using special relativity, the time would be different.

But the given options don't seem to suggest any relativistic effects. Let me think, 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. So the gamma factor would be sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))^-1.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. So the time in the Galaxy's frame would be gamma times the ejecta's frame time. So 50 * gamma ≈ 51.02 seconds.

Wait, but this is getting into special relativity. But the question seems to present the problem in a way that expects a straightforward approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated as a Galilean transformation, where the time is the same in both frames. So the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 seconds = 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, option B is 3,000,000 km.

But wait, that's assuming that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame. But according to special relativity, that's not the case. So which approach should I take?

The problem statement says both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So in that case, perhaps the intended approach is to use classical mechanics.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem gives the velocity as 60,000 km/s. That's 0.2c, so maybe it's expecting a relativistic solution. But the problem gives 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using the proper time or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is only about the relative velocity and not considering time dilation. Because the problem is presented as a multiple-choice with a straightforward calculation.

So, if I take the classical approach, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. The time in the Galaxy's frame would be the same as the ejecta's frame time, so 50 seconds. So distance = speed * time = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Option B.

But what if the time isn't the same? Let's think again. The problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s. So the time experienced by the ejecta (proper time) is shorter due to time dilation.

Wait, no. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the clock. So if the ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy (the observer in the Galaxy's frame), then the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (tau) is related to the Galaxy's frame time (t) via the Lorentz transformation.

The relation is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if tau is 50 seconds, then t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. So v^2/c^2 is (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98.

So t = 50 / 0.98 ≈ 51.02 seconds in the Galaxy's frame.

Then, the distance traveled is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close.

But wait, the problem states that both frames are inertial. So should I use the relativistic approach?

Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention anything about time dilation, so perhaps it's intended to ignore relativity effects and treat the time as the same in both frames. That would give 3,000,000 km, option B.

But that seems incorrect because at 60,000 km/s, relativistic effects are significant. However, in exams, sometimes such problems are framed to expect a classical approach unless told otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of relative velocity in a way that doesn't involve time. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s. The time in the Galaxy's frame is not the same as in the ejecta's frame.

So to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in its own frame.

Wait, no. The question is: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame.

So, the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

Thus, the distance would be v * t, where t is the Galaxy's frame time.

Wait, no. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, and the time elapsed is t, so the distance is v*t.

But t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds. So how do we find t?

In the ejecta's frame, proper time is 50 seconds. So in the Galaxy's frame, the elapsed time is longer.

The relation between the two is:

tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

So t = tau / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 50 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )

As before, sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9798.

So t ≈ 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

So the distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.02 s ≈ 3,061,200 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is the closest to our calculation.

So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, why isn't the time the same in both frames? Because the problem states that the ejecta and galaxy are inertial frames, so relativity applies.

So, I think the correct approach is to use the time dilation factor.

So distance = v * t = 60,000 * 51.02 ≈ 3,061,200 km.

The option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Perhaps due to rounding, or maybe I should be more precise with the square root.

Let me calculate sqrt(0.96) exactly.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = (sqrt(96))/10. sqrt(96) is 9.798... So 9.798/10 = 0.9798.

So t = 50 / 0.9798 ≈ 51.02 seconds.

60,000 * 51.02 = let's compute that.

51.02 * 60,000 = 51.02 * 6e4 = 51.02 * 60,000.

Compute 51 *60,000 =3,060,000.

0.02 *60,000=1,200.

Total 3,061,200.

So the exact calculation is 3,061,200 km, but the option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the approximation is expected, or perhaps the question intended a simpler approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame to calculate the distance, but that would be different.

Wait, no. The question specifies the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So the correct approach is to use the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of **60,000 km/s** in the Galaxy's frame. The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that **50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame**.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Relative Motion and Frames**:  
   The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Conversely, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

2. **Time Dilation**:  
   Since the relative velocity between the frames is **60,000 km/s** (or 0.2c), relativistic effects must be considered. The proper time (τ) in the ejecta's frame is related to the time (t) in the Galaxy's frame by the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \(t\):  
   \[
   t = \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 0.2c\), we calculate:  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2} = \sqrt{0.96} \approx 0.9798
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   t = \frac{50}{0.9798} \approx 51.02 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(t \approx 51.02 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.02 \approx 3,061,200 \, \text{km}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The closest option to the calculated distance is **3,060,000 km**.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
