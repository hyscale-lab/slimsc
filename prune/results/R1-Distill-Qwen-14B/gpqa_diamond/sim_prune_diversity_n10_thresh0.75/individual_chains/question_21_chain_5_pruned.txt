Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm. The question has two parts, A and B. So part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. Then, for part B, the options are between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

First, let me tackle part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism, okay. I remember that tautomerism occurs when hydrogen atoms and electrons shift between adjacent atoms, resulting in the movement of a hydrogen from one atom to another, leading to the formation of different isomers. So it's a kind of structural isomerism, maybe constitutional isomerism? Wait, no, tautomers are a type of isomer where the positions of hydrogen atoms change, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound, right? Quinones have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone is o-benzoquinone, which is 1,2-benzoquinone, but wait, isn't it the same as para? No, wait, no. Benzoquinone can have either adjacent (ortho) or opposite (para) ketone groups. Wait, or maybe I'm mixing that up. Oh, wait, 1,2 and 1,4 are the two possible positions for the two ketones in benzoquinone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So it's a symmetric structure. Now, tautomerism usually involves the ability to form different tautomers, which requires the presence of a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a carbonyl group, if there's a hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, it can tautomerize.

Wait, so in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at adjacent positions. So for 1,2-benzoquin
