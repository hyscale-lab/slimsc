Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some terms next to it. The terms are alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I'm supposed to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, right. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the perturbation expansion. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant and maybe some other terms from integrals.

I remember that each loop brings in an integral over a four-momentum, which often introduces factors like (4π)^epsilon or something similar, especially when regularization is involved. But in this case, the term has (4pi)^6 in the denominator. So maybe each loop contributes a (4pi)^something term.

Wait, let's think about the general structure of Feynman diagrams. Each loop in a Feynman diagram is associated with a certain power of the coupling constants and also factors from the integrals. For example, in a one-loop diagram, you might have a term involving (alpha) times some integral factors. But for higher loops, the powers of alpha (or the coupling constants) increase, and so do the powers from the integrals.

The given term is alpha^3 * g^2 * ... So alpha is usually the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi ε_0 something), but in the context of loop integrals, it's often used as a dimensionless coupling. So, if the term has alpha^3, perhaps there are 3 loops? Because each loop might bring in an alpha factor. But wait, sometimes vertices contribute as well.

Wait, another approach. The overall scaling of the amplitude with energy scales can give a clue. The term (Q/M)^2 suggests a ratio of some energy scale Q over another M. But how does that tie into the number of loops?

Alternatively, I should think about the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence for a Feynman diagram in four dimensions is given by D = 4L - 2I + V, where L is the number of loops, I the number of internal lines, and V the
