Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Parallax (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. Right.

So if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. That's helpful. Now the number of stars (let's call it N) varies as 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting d into that, since plx is 1/d, then plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, wait, because N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, so 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So they're probably asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance, or the rate at which the number increases as you go further. So perhaps the question is about the derivative of N with respect to r (distance), or maybe the number per unit r.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm. So maybe they're asking for dN/dr, the derivative. Or maybe it's the differential number, like ΔN over dr, the change per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps they're considering the number density, or the number per unit volume. But I'm not certain. Let me think again.
