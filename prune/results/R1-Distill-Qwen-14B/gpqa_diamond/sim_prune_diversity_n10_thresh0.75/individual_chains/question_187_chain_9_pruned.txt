Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's known for its high resolving power, but I think that's more about the spectral lines than the brightness of the star.

The question says a star is detectable if it gives a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each star whether the S/N meets this criteria.

Wait, what determines the S/N in a spectrograph? I think it's related to the brightness of the star and the exposure time. The formula I recall is S/N proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. Also, the S/N per pixel depends on the instrument's efficiency and the star's magnitude.

ESPRESSO's performance is probably given in terms of S/N per unit time and magnitude. Oh right, I think the ESPRESSO system has a certain S/N per hour per magnitude. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact numbers, so maybe I can think about the V magnitude of each star and how that affects the S/N.

Wait, the stars in options c, d, e, f all have the same absolute magnitude, V=15. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. So their apparent magnitudes would vary based on their distance.

Apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So for each star:

c) 10 pc. m = 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 + 0 =15.

e) 5 pc. m=15 +5 log(5/10)=15 +5 log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15 -1.505 ≈13.495.

d) 200 pc. m=15 +5 log(200/10)=15 +5 log(20)=15 +5*(1.3010)=15 +6.505=21.505.

f)50 pc: m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5*(1.69897)=15 +8.495=23.495.

So the apparent magnitudes are: c=15, e≈13.5, d≈21.5, f≈23.5.

Wait, but how does this translate into S/N? I think the S/N for a star depends on its flux. Each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. So fainter stars (higher m) have lower flux, so lower S/N.

ESPRESSO's S/N depends on the star's brightness, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. Suppose for a given star, the S/N per pixel is proportional to
