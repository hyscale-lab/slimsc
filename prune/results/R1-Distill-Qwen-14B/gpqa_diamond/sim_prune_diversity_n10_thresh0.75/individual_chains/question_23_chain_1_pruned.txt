Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr), and then looking at the TLC results to figure out the products. Let's break it down.

First, let me try to visualize the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Breaking it down: the benzene ring is substituted with an oxygen atom (like a phenol, but here it's an ether). The oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw this structure.

So the butenyl group has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's but-3-en). So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait. No, let me count again. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 if we number from the oxygen. Wait, no: the butenyl is CH2CH2CHCH2, but wait, with substituents. So the structure is more like:

The oxygen is attached to the first carbon of a four-carbon chain. The chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but with substituents. No, the correct structure would be: The chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's butyl. But it's butenyl, so there's a double bond. Oh, right, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH, but wait, but that doesn't make sense because the position of the double bond. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, butene has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3,
