Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. There are two parts to this problem: part A and part B. Each involves a reaction leading to a major product, and I need to choose the correct options from A to D.

First, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The first reaction is:
(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + 1. BuLi, 2. H+ → A

The second reaction is:
3,4,5,7,8,9-hexamethyl-1,11-dimethylene-2,6,10,11,11a,11b-hexahydro-1H-benzo[cd]indeno[7,1-gh]azulene + Heat → B

The options give possible products A and B, so I need to figure out both.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better.

The benzene ring is substituted with an ether group: (OCH2CH2CH(CH3)). Wait, more precisely, the group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So, the but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait, that's not right. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but no, wait, let me correct. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C2 and C
