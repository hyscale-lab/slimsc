Okay, I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the gene has five exons and four introns. The anti-nutritional compound is caused by this gene, so we want to disrupt its function. The question is about which mutation would achieve that.

Looking at the sequencing data, all mutants have changes in the first exon. Remember that exons are the coding regions, so mutations here might affect the protein product.

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and then continues. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Mutant 1:
The sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... So looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C ...

Oh wait, perhaps the letters are a bit different. Let me parse the sequences more carefully. The first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TCT ACG C...

Wait, I'm looking at the first part. The change is in the third codon. So in the intact gene, the third codon after ATG is TTT (which codes for phenylalanine). In Mutant1, it's TCT (serine), then ACG (threonine) instead of CTC (leucine? Or wait, wait. Let me get this right.

Wait, let's compare the exact sequences:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...
Mutant1: ...TCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, the exact change is in the middle of the first exon. Let me see the exact letters.

Wait, the initial part of the intact gene is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
