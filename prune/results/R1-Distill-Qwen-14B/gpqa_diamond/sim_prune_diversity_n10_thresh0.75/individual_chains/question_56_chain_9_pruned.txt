Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Let me think about what those are.

The question mentions the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions mean that it's an electric dipole transition, right? So the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are important here. I think the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, where l is the angular momentum quantum number and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, right. So for an allowed transition, the change in angular momentum (l) can be either +1, 0, or -1? Or wait, no, I think for electric dipole transitions, the change in l has to be ±1. Because I remember that when l changes by 0, it's a quadrupole transition or something else, not dipole. So in this case, since it's a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0.

Wait, but wait. How can the initial and final l be the same? Because for dipole transitions, Δl should be ±1. So going from l=0 to l=0 would violate that. That can't happen in a single dipole transition. So how does the state decay then?

Ah, it must decay via two dipole transitions. So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to some l=1 state, then another transition to 1,0,0.

So the first step: from n=3 to n=2 or n=4, but wait, n=3 can't go to n=4 because energy is higher, but the atom is decaying, so it should emit a photon, going to a lower energy state. So n decreases. So from 3 to 2, or perhaps to 1.

Wait, but if it's a two-step process, the first step is 3→ something, then to 1. Wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, meaning two steps. So the first step would be from |3,0,0⟩ to some state with l=1, perhaps n=2, l=1, m=0, or other m values. Then the second step would be from that state to |1,0,0⟩.

But wait, the second transition would again require Δl=±1. So if the intermediate state has l=1, then the next step would need to go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state is l=0, so that's possible. So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1, and then from l=1 to l=0.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to an l=1 state. Let's consider possible m values.

In the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1.
