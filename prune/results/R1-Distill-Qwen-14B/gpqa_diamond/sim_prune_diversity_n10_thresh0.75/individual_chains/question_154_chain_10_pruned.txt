Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

So, a chemist found an unnamed bottle with a white solid. He did some spectral analysis—mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR—and now we need to figure out what the compound is from the options given. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. 

Let me start by looking at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. But wait, the second peak is 158, which is two units higher. That might suggest something like a chlorine isotope or maybe a fragment.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols, carboxylic acids, or maybe amides. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is significant. That area is usually carbonyl (C=O) stretching. For example, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, or maybe an acid chloride. 

So, looking at the options, let's think about each. Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That has a benzaldehyde group (so a carbonyl) and a hydroxyl group. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me check the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding up: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. So that might be a problem. Or maybe I miscalculated. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is different.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl at position 4. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A, so same molecular weight. 12*7=84, H5=5, Cl=35.5, O2=32. 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, but maybe in the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 is due to the Cl isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So, molecular ion peak would be at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The abundance should be in the ratio of 3:1, since 35Cl is more abundant. Wait, the given data is molecular ion at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). So 32% relative to 100%? Let me think: the ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl is about 75:25. So if the molecular weight is 156, with Cl, the isotopic peaks would be at 156 (35Cl: 75%) and 158 (37Cl: 25%). But the given 158 peak is 32%, which is close to 25% (but a bit higher). Maybe that's within some error, or perhaps the main peak is at 156, and the 158 is a fragment. Hmm, not sure yet.

Moving on to the NMR data. The 1H NMR has three signals. The first is at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong downfield shift, which is typical for an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak, but in the data, it's a singlet. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, an aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But in the IR, we saw a broad peak between 3500-2700, which could be an -OH stretch. If it's a carboxylic acid, that makes sense because they have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but in the IR it's from 3500-2700, which is a broader region. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol, but alcohol O-H is usually less broad than a carboxylic acid.

The other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those are in the aromatic region. A doublet each suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at positions 2 and 4? Wait, no. Let me think about the splitting. If you have two doublets, each integrating for 2H, that suggests a para-substitution pattern. Like, two substituents opposite each other on the benzene ring, each causing the neighboring protons to couple. So for example, in benzoic acid derivatives, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets. 

So putting this together: the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituent groups. One of those groups is causing a strong downfield shift in one of the protons. Wait, but in the NMR, the 11 ppm peak is a singlet. So that would be a -COOH group's OH, perhaps. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10, but in this case it's 11.0. Hmm. 

Looking back at the options. Let me list their structures:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is benzaldehyde with OH at position 2 and Cl at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). Wait, no. Wait, benzaldehyde is a benzene ring with a CHO group attached. So numbering would be such that the CHO is at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3. So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, 3? That would make the aromatic protons in positions 4,5,6. But the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H. So perhaps in this structure, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe the ring is more symmetric.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid (COOH) group at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The ring would have two substituents opposite each other (para). Then, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But wait, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 3 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to Cl. 

In the NMR, the two doublets would come from the protons adjacent to the substituents. Let me think: in para-substituted benzoic acids, the ring protons are typically split into two sets of doublets. For example, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) might be deshielded and as a doublet because they're next to the COOH group. Similarly, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would couple with each other. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 adjacent to Cl. So the protons at 2
