Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it's an elastic scattering experiment with 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. They want the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is represented by f(θ), and it can be expressed using partial waves. The formula involves the sum over all angular momentum states, each contributing a term with a phase shift and spherical harmonics or something like that.

Oh right, the general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction. That would correspond to θ=0 degrees, I think. Because the incident beam is along the initial direction, so when you measure the scattered particles' direction, θ=0 is the same as the incident direction.

And for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 when l=0, and 0 for all other l. Because P₀(x)=1, and P_l(1) is zero for l >0. So, the sum reduces only to the l=0 term when θ=0.

So the scattering amplitude f(θ) along the incident direction (θ=0) is just the l=0 term. Which is (1/(2ik)) * (2*0 +1) e^{i δ₀} sin δ₀ * P₀(1). Since P₀(1)=1, this simplifies to (1/(2ik)) *1 * e^{i δ₀} sin δ₀.

Wait, but wait. The amplitude f is a complex quantity. They’re asking for the imaginary part of f. So let's break down that expression.

First, let's compute the real and imaginary parts. The term e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when we multiply by sin δ_l, we get cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l
