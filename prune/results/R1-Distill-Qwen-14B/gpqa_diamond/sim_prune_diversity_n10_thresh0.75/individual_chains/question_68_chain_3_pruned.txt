Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their magnetic moments related to their spin. The question says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction, right?

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. That means the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. I need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian for the system must change. Initially, the Hamiltonian must have been proportional to Sz, and then it becomes proportional to Sy after the field changes.

Hmm, right. The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are given by the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So the initial Hamiltonian H_initial is something like -mu·B. Oh wait, but mu is gamma Sz, so H_initial would be proportional to Sz. Since the field is in +Z, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. So the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down in the z-direction.

But then the magnetic field is switched to +Y. So the new Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to Sy. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the new H is proportional to gamma Sy.

Wait, so the time evolution of the system would be governed by this new Hamiltonian. But the state of the system before the field change was an eigenstate of Sz. So after the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The question asks about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. Since mu_z is <Sz> multiplied by gamma, I think. So if I can find how <Sz> oscillates over time, I can find the oscillation frequency.

Wait, the time evolution under a Hamiltonian H is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)>, assuming H is time-independent after the switch.
