Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And when the wavelength is shorter than that (so bluer), the flux drops a lot. Wait, I remember something about flux peaks and redshift. Oh right! The Lyman-alpha forest comes into play at around 121 nm (that's the Lyman-alpha line for hydrogen), but if the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. But wait, this peak is at 790 nm. Oh wait, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line being observed at a longer wavelength because of the quasar's redshift. No, wait, Lyman-alpha is in the UV, so if it's observed in optical or IR, that suggests a significant redshift.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared. So if the emitted wavelength is, say, 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then the observed wavelength is longer. The redshift z would be (observed wavelength / emitted wavelength) -1. So 790 / 121 is approximately 6.52. So z would be about 5.52. Wait, that can't be right. Because 790 nm is in the near IR, but 121 nm is UV. So if the quasar's emission line is at 121 nm, but observed at 790 nm, that's a factor of about 6.5, so z=5.5. That's a high redshift.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1. Hmm. Comoving distance D_C is the distance that relates the observed redshift to the actual distance. The formula for comoving distance is D_C = (1/(1+z)) * ∫(from 0 to z) c / H(a) da, where H(a) is the Hubble parameter at scale factor a.

In a flat universe, the comoving distance depends on the matter density (Ω_m), dark energy density (Ω_Λ), and the Hubble constant H0. The parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, and it's flat (so Ω_k=0).

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance at a=1, which is the present day. Oh wait, no. The comoving distance for a source at redshift z is measured from a=1/(1+z) to a=1. Wait, no—the comoving distance is from the observer (a=1) to the source at a=1/(1+z). Wait, no, actually, the comoving distance is the distance a photon would travel in a time-integrated expansion of the universe. So for a source at redshift z, the comoving distance is the integral from a=0 to a=1/(1+z) of c da / (a² H(a)). Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying,
