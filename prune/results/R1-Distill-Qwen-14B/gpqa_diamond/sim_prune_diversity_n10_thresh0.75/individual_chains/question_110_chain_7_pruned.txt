Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key point is that each spectrograph has different brightness limits for the stars they can observe.

From the question, I know that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait—the wording says 'brighter than 17 mag'—so does that mean they can see up to 17 mag or below? Oh right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude 17 is dimmer than a star with V=16. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17, meaning stars that are brighter than 17 (so V ≤17). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V ≤16 mag can be detected with HIRES.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the brighter limit for both. Wait, no. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, which is fainter. So to be detected by both, the star's V mag must be brighter than 17 (so ≤17) for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 (≤16) for HIRES. So the star must have V ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is ≤16, it's acceptable for both. While if it's 17, ESPRESSO can take it but HIRES can't.

Wait no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". So brighter than 17 is V mag less than 17. So for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it's acceptable. So the maximum V mag each can handle is 17 for ESPRESSO and 16 for HIRES.

So a star must have V mag ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16.
