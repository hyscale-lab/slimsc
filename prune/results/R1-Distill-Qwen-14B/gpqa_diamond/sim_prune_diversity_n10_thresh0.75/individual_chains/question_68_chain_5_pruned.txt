Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me take it step by step.

So, the setup is a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin 1/2 particles have spin up or down states, right? And their magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * Sz. Here, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh wait, Sz is the spin component along the z-axis, which has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for spin-up and spin-down, respectively.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. That means the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, because the magnetic field is along Z. So, if B is the magnetic field strength, the energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy for each state would be something like E = -mu·B. But since mu is gamma*Sz, which for spin up is gamma*ħ/2, so E_up is -gamma ħ B/2, and E_down is gamma ħ B/2, but wait, actually depends on the direction of the magnetic moment. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Hamiltonian.

The initial Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma B Sz ħ? Wait, isn't the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect H = -μ·B. Since μ is gamma Sz ħ, then H = -gamma B Sz. Oh wait, no, because Sz has units of angular momentum, and B is in tesla. Wait, perhaps I need to get the units right. But maybe that's not critical right now.

So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, say |+z> or |−z>. Let's say it's |+z> for simplicity, but I think the initial state doesn't affect the frequency of oscillation since the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y direction, same magnitude B. So the new magnetic field is along Y, same strength.

After the field change, the particle's state doesn't change instantaneously because the change is sudden. So the wavefunction remains the same, but the Hamiltonian changes.

The new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y, because the magnetic field is now along Y. Wait, no: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, and the energy is mu dot B. So H = -mu · B, so H = -gamma B (S · direction). So if B is along Y, then H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S is in units of ħ/2. So S_x, S_y, S_z are each (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, I think. So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So the new Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

Wait, but let me make sure. Spin operators are S_i = (ħ/2) sigma_i. So S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

But wait, the energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. mu is gamma S, so mu = gamma S. So mu · B = gamma S · B. So H = -mu · B = - gamma B (S · n), where n is the direction of B. Since B is along Y, n is (0,1,0). So H = - gamma B S_y.

Which brings us back to H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y / 2? Wait, no, because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = -gamma B * (ħ/2) sigma_y. Hmm, perhaps I should just write it as H = (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y times -1. Wait, perhaps I should factor out the negative sign. Let's see.

So H is proportional to sigma_y, but I think the sign will matter for the energy levels. Anyway, what matters is the time evolution under this Hamiltonian.

The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But the new Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates of H_final are the eigenstates of S_y.

Since the state was initially |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of S_y, the state will evolve in time according to H_final.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment, i.e., <Sz>, and how it oscillates over time.

So I need to find the time dependence of <Sz> after the field is switched.

Let me think about the time evolution. The state at time t is given by the time evolution operator. Since H_final is time-independent, the state is |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)>, where |psi(0)> is |+z>.

But perhaps it's easier to work in terms of energy eigenstates and express |+z> in terms of those.

Alternatively, I can find the time dependence using the time evolution equation. Let me think.

Since H_final is proportional to S_y, which is (ħ/2) sigma_y, perhaps it's better to write H_final in terms of sigma_y.

Let me compute H_final.

H_final = -gamma B S_y = -gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So H_final = (- gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y.

Let me denote ω = gamma B. Because when I see oscillation frequencies, they often come from terms involving gamma and B. But wait, let me think about the units. gamma has units of (rad s^-1 T^-1) or something like that. So gamma B would have units of rad/s, so that makes sense for a frequency term.

So H_final can be written as ( - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y ) which is (- ω ħ / 2 ) sigma_y, with ω = gamma B.

Wait, but units might not be critical now. Let me just proceed.

The state |+z> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |−y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |−z>.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value of Sz over time.

The expectation value of Sz is given by <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.

Since the state evolves as |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z>,
