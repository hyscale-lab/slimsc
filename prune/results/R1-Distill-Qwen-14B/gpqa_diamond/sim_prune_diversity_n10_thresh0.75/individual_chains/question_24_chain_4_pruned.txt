Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about some mixtures undergoing certain reactions. Let me try to break it down.

First, there's a mixture X, which is equimolar of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means they have double bonds. So, maybe alkenes or something with unsaturated bonds. Because when alkenes react with bromine, they add across the double bond, causing the solution to decolorize.

Then, mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, leading to mixture Y. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, and this mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, but Y comes from a reaction involving X and platinum. Oh right, platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but wait, the process is called hydrogenation? Wait, no, sometimes it's used in other reactions too.

Wait, the question says that treatment with platinum when heated causes a disproportionation. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction.

So, X is a mixture of two liquids that can each undergo some reaction when heated with Pt. Oh wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via disproportionation. So maybe each component of X is undergoing a reaction, but perhaps each undergoes a different reaction, but the key is that Y is a mixture of two other liquids that don't have the ability to decolorize bromine water.

Wait, X's components can decolorize bromine water, meaning they have unsaturated bonds, but Y's can't, so maybe those bonds are saturated. So perhaps X's components are alkenes, and Y's are alkanes or something without double bonds.

But wait, the question says that Y is formed by a disproportionation. So maybe each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think about what the products are. Later, when X and Y undergo hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance, hydrocarbon Z. And Z is part of mixture Y. Also, Z is a solvent, something like hex
