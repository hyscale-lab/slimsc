Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. The question is about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, specifically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Hmm, I remember that this principle relates the uncertainty in an electron's position and momentum. 

The problem says an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are given in terms of order of magnitude, so I don't need to calculate the exact value but just figure out which power of ten it's closest to.

Wait, so how does the uncertainty in position relate to energy? I think I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Oh right, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So first, I need to find Δp based on Δx.

But wait, the question asks about the uncertainty in energy. Energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy equation, right? Kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So perhaps once I find Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy, ΔE.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the uncertainty principle directly for energy and time
