Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to the distance to a star. The formula is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. So higher parallax means closer stars. Oh wait, right, because closer stars have larger parallax angles.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what way? I think that probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere. Or maybe it's uniform in terms of volume, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, uniform distribution in the sky probably refers to the celestial sphere. So the stars are spread out uniformly on the sphere. But I'm not sure if that's the same as spatial uniformity. Oh, maybe the way the question is phrased, it's about how the number of stars per unit parallax interval varies as plx changes.

I think I need to consider the relation between parallax and distance, and how the number of stars would be distributed along that. Let's think about the volume of space at a certain distance. For a shell at distance d, the thickness might relate to the parallax range.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density, which I'll call n (stars per cubic parsec). So number per shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx p = 1/d, then d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because as p increases, d decreases, but I'm not sure if that affects the counting. Let me just substitute d in terms of p.

So substituting d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p², and dd is ( -1/p² ) dp. But since dp is a small positive
