Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and it's a bit tricky. Let me take it step by step. The question involves two reactions: the first is a reaction involving BuLi and H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement under heat. I'm supposed to find the major products A and B from these reactions and match them with the given options.

First, let me look at the structures involved. The first reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Breaking that down, the benzene ring is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a CH2 group. Then, the other part is a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So that's a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the second carbon, and a methyl branch at the third carbon.

The reaction conditions for part A are BuLi (butyllithium) followed by H+. BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. It's also a good nucleophile. When dealing with enol ethers or similar structures, BuLi can cause elimination or addition reactions. 

Wait, the structure here is an enol ether. The molecule is an alkoxy group (OCH2) attached to a benzene, and the other part of the oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So the structure is like Ph-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me draw this out. The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, but the substituent is but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, the butenyl would be CH
