Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The planets have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from its star and its albedo. Oh wait, albedo is the same for all, so that might not affect the ratio. 

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^1/4 * ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) * (1 + (R/R*)^2.5) ) )^(1/4), but wait, that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Oh right, for a simplified case where we assume circular orbits (so e is zero), and the same star, and same albedo, maybe the formula simplifies.

I think the basic formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_earth * (D / 1 AU)^(1/2), where D is the distance from the star in AU. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because Kepler's third law relates the period and the semi-major axis: P² ∝ a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

So, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance, which relates to the period. So if we have two planets, their equilibrium temperatures would be in the ratio of (P1/P2)^1/4, but wait, wait. No, no, the formula is T ∝ (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4) (1 - a)^1/4. Since L and σ are constants, and a
