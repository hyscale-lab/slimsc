Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle in a certain potential. Let's break it down step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, so it's a two-dimensional problem because it's in terms of r and θ, which are polar coordinates. I remember that in such cases, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in polar coordinates, and if the potential has certain symmetries, the problem might be separable.

Wait, the potential has two parts: the first is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think about how this affects the system. Cosine squared of theta suggests that the potential varies with the angle θ. But how?

In two-dimensional polar coordinates, the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²), right? And the potential adds those terms involving r and θ. So the full Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, I should try to separate the variables. Let's see: can I write the potential as a function that depends on r and θ in a way that allows the Hamiltonian to be separated into radial and angular parts?

Let me combine the terms. The potential is V(r) + W(r,θ), where V(r) is (1/2)k r² and W(r,θ) is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that doesn't help much on its own. Maybe I can look for a coordinate transformation or find if the potential can be expressed in terms of other variables, like x and y.

Wait, another approach: suppose I rewrite cos²θ using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute this. (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)(1 + cos2θ). So the potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ).

Expanding that, it's (1/2 + 3/4) k r² plus (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Let me compute those coefficients: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4. So V becomes (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but now I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can re-express the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let me think: r² cos²θ is x²
