Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second, is that a column vector or a row vector? Oh right, the question says it's a column matrix, so it's a 3x1 column vector. So the state vector is:

|ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T

I think that's how it's written. Then, there's an observable P represented by a 3x3 matrix. The matrix P has its first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). 

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. So I need to find the probability that the outcome is 0 when measuring P in this state.

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's projection onto the state.

So, for each eigenvalue λ of P, the probability is |<v|ψ>|², where |v> is the eigenvector corresponding to λ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The matrix P is given, and I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, right? Then, for each eigenvalue, compute the projection of the state onto the eigenvector and square it to get the probability.

Wait a minute, but maybe there's a shortcut here. Let me think about the form of P. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, this looks like a symmetric matrix, which is good because symmetric matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. That makes sense for observables.

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me try to compute them. But
