Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a total of 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 2 oxygens. Let me think about the possible structures. The options given are all organic compounds, so probably aromatic with some substituents and maybe an ester or amide group.

Looking at the IR data first. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 suggest N-H or O-H stretching. Those are usually broad, but the question says medium to strong intensity. Wait, but if they're in the 3400 region, maybe it's N-H from an amide or amine. Alternatively, alcohol O-H might be broader, but maybe the sample was dried so maybe not. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group. So either ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But since the formula has two oxygens, maybe ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl chain. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe part of an ethyl ester or ethyl group attached elsewhere.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – a broad singlet for 2H. Could be NH2 group, but in this case, maybe a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom. Or perhaps an oxygenated CH2, like in an ester or amide.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet. That's a split into four, so two neighboring groups. Quartet could be a CH2 next to another CH2. Maybe part of an ester group, like the CH2 in an ethyl ester. Wait, the ethyl ester would typically have the CH2COO group. Let's think: in an ethyl ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. The CH2CH3 group would be the ethyl part, and the other CH2 would be the OCH2. So in the NMR, the OCH2 would show up
