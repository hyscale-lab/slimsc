Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that method affects how I calculate their periods. Maybe it's more about how they were detected, not the calculation here.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, so T1/T2 = 1.4. Wait, no, wait. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2? Or is it the other way around? Let me clarify. If it's Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, then T1 is higher than T2. Because 1.4 is more than 1. So T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3? Wait, no, wait. The way it's phrased: "between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3." So does that mean T2 is 2.3 times T3, or T3 is 2.3 times T2? I think the ratio is T2 over T3. Let me think. If T2 is hotter than T3, then the ratio would be higher than 1. So T2 = 2.3 * T3.

Next, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15. So M1 = 1.15 * M2. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 1.35. So M2 = 1.35 * M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 * M3 = approximately 1.5525 * M3. So M1 is about 1.55 times M3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So I'm looking for the ratio P3/P1.

Wait, but the question says, by what factor is the orbital period of
