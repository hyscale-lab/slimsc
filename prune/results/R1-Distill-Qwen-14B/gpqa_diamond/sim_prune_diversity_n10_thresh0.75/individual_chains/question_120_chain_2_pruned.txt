Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. I remember from my astronomy class that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax (often denoted as plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star when viewed from two points on Earth's orbit. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

The question is asking about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (so like a slice of parallax) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to some exponent.

Wait, I think it's about the density of stars in a certain range of parallax. So more distant stars have smaller parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, how does their density change with distance?

Wait, wait. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per volume) is constant. But the way we observe them depends on the volume they occupy as we look at them from Earth. So the number of stars we observe in a certain parallax range depends on the volume. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in plx corresponds to a larger change in distance when plx is small.

Let me think: the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd is proportional to the surface area of the shell (since stars are spread uniformly) multiplied by the thickness dd. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so for a thin shell, the volume element is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit of plx. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that.

The number of stars per unit plx (say, plx to plx + dplx) would involve integrating over the distance corresponding to that plx range. So let's express everything in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx. So dd is the change in distance when plx changes by dplx. Let's compute dd in terms of dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but since
