Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the reaction between a saturated epoxide and an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to determine which product is formed from this reaction.

Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack epoxides. The epoxide ring has two carbons, each attached to an oxygen. The reaction is usually an SN2 mechanism, but I think it's more about where the nucleophile attacks and how the stereochemistry changes.

Wait, the question mentions that when epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group from the reagent is added to the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

Let me try to draw the structure of the starting epoxide. The compound is bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an oxygen at position 7. The substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. So, the structure is a norbornane derivative. The oxygen is part of the epoxide ring, so it's a bridgehead epoxide.

The configuration is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So, looking at the bicyclo structure, positions 1, 3, and 4 are all R, and 6 is S. Wait, norbornane is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but here it's bicyclo[4.1.0], which would be a different structure. Let me think. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have two rings: one is a four-membered ring and the other a one-membered bridge? No, that can't be right. Wait, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[m.n.p], where m
