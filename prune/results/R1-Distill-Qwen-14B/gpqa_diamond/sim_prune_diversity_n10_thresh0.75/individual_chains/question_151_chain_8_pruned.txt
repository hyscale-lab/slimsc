Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to understand it. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting zero. Alright, let's break it down.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in 3-dimensional space, right? Let me write that down. The state vector is:

|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1. Let's compute that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. So 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because probabilities need the vector to be normalized. So I think I should normalize it first. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not add up correctly.

So the normalization factor would be 1 over the square root of the sum. The sum is 6, so the normalization is 1/sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as:

|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Okay, next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. The second row is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]. The third row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, what's the structure of P? Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, interesting. I wonder what this operator represents. It looks like it's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvalues would be the possible outcomes of the measurement.

The question asks for the probability of measuring 0. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, then find the eigenvectors corresponding to zero and compute the probability.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of P as a projection operator. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the properties of P.

First, let's compute the eigenvalues of P. Because the eigenvalues of an observable are the possible measurement outcomes. So if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state ψ.

But perhaps it's better to compute the eigenvalues. Let's see.

To find the eigenvalues λ, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix P - λ I:

[ -λ      1/√2      0     ]
[1/√2
