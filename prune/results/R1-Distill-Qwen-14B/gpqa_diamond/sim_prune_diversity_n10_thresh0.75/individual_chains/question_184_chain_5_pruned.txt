Okay, I need to figure out which reaction sequence will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 2, 1, and 3. Wait, numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me visualize the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, but wait, the numbering in the name is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So positions 1,2,3 each have substituents. So the ring substituents are at ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

In such cases, when multiple substituents are present, the order of introducing them is crucial because of the directing effects of the substituents. Remember, substituents can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

Benzene is our starting material. Let's think about the substituents we're adding.

1. Nitro group (-NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing.
2. Ethoxy group (-OEt): Activating, ortho/para-directing.
3. tert-Butyl group (-tBu): It's a bulky group, and since it's an alkyl group, it's activating (but less so than -OEt) and ortho/para-directing.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director, which
