Okay, I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these black body radiation and star properties concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data is: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, I remember that mass and radius are related differently depending on the star's stage, but maybe for this problem, I can ignore that since the question is about luminosity.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because if λ is same, T must be same. So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point.

Another piece of data: radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Wait, but the peak wavelengths they measured were for the stars' own emissions, so we don't have to correct for Doppler shift in this calculation. Because the maximum emission is determined by the star's own temperature. So the observed radial velocities might be for something else, like their motion relative to us, but since the peak wavelength is the same, maybe the velocities don't affect the temperature in this context. I think I can proceed without considering the radial velocities for calculating luminosity.

The question is about the luminosity ratio. Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since σ and 4π are constants.

We know that the temperatures are the same because the peak wavelengths are the same. So T1 = T2. Therefore, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T ratio) part is 1, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25. But wait, the options include 2.23, 2.32, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. Are the stars' temperatures actually the same? Because if their observed peak wavelengths are the same due to Doppler shift, that complicates things. Oh wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. So λ_max for each is the same as observed. But if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would shift. So maybe Star_2 is moving away or towards us, affecting its observed λ_max, but the problem states that the λ_max observed is the same for both.

Oh, right! The peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So their actual temperatures might be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same.

Wait, so then I have to consider that the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual λ_max depends on the star's temperature and their velocity relative to us.

Wait, let me think carefully. The peak wavelength emitted by the star (λ_rest) is given by Wien's Law based on its temperature. But when the star is moving relative to us, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the Doppler effect. So λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), approximately, assuming v is much less than c (v_r is the radial velocity). Or more accurately, for non-relativistic speeds, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive if moving away, negative towards.

But since both stars have the same observed λ_max, their λ_rest must satisfy:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs

So,

λ1_rest * (1 + v1_r / c) ≈ λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

Where v1_r is the radial velocity of Star_1, which is 0, and v2_r is 700 km/s. Wait, but the problem states that Star_1's radial velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. But wait, what's the sign convention here? If Star_2 is moving away, v_r is positive; if moving towards, it's negative.

Wait, so Star_1's observed λ_max is λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + 0) = λ1_rest.

Star_2's observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, then:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c )

But from Wien's Law, λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2_r / c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r / c )

But wait, v2_r is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2_r / c.

c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So T1 ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997666 T2.

So T1 is approximately 0.9977 T2.

Wait, but wait, are we assuming that Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive) or towards (v_r negative) us?

In the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max would be longer (redshifted), so λ_obs is larger. But the observed λ_max for both is same, so Star_1's λ_rest is same as Star_2's λ_obs, which is longer than Star_2's λ_rest.

Wait, perhaps I should model this more accurately.

Let me restate:

For Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r / c ), assuming it's moving away (v_r positive).

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2_r / c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2_r /c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r /c )

So T1 is T2 divided by a factor slightly larger than 1, because v2_r is positive (assuming it's moving away). So T1 is less than T2.

Wait, but wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so since λ_obs is the same as Star_1's, which doesn't move, that requires that Star_1's rest wavelength is shorter than Star_2's rest wavelength. Because Star_2's λ_obs is longer than its rest. So for their observed λ to be same, Star_1's rest λ must be shorter, meaning higher temperature. Because T is inversely proportional to λ. So T1 = (b)/(λ1_rest), and T2 = (b)/(λ2_rest). If λ1_rest < λ2_rest, then T1 > T2.

But wait, from earlier, I had:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2_r /c )

Wait, that would imply T1 < T2.

But according to the observed λ, since Star_2 is moving away, its λ_obs is longer. So if both have same λ_obs, then Star_1's λ_rest must be less than Star_2's, because Star_2's λ_obs is increased. So Star_1 is hotter than Star_2.

So this seems contradictory. Let me think again.

Suppose Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. Then its observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. So λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5) ≈ 1.002333 * λ2_rest.

Star_1's observed λ is same as Star_2's observed λ: λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_rest, because its radial velocity is zero.

So, λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + 700/3e5)

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + 0.002333)

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.002333

=> T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997666 T2.

Wait, that would imply T1 is lower than T2. But that can't be, because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ is longer than its rest. So Star_1's λ_rest is longer than Star_2's rest λ? Or am I getting this wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the inverse.

Wait, because if Star_2 is moving away, λ2_obs is larger, but λ1_obs equals λ2_obs. So λ1_rest must be larger than λ2_rest times (1 + v2_r/c). Because λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v2_r/c), which would make λ1_rest longer than λ2_rest. So λ1_rest > λ2_rest implies T1 < T2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the rest wavelength is longer, the temperature is lower. So Star_1 is actually cooler than Star_2.

So T1 = T2 / (1 + 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997666.

So T1 is about 0.9977 T2.

But let's compute this more accurately.

Compute 700 / (3e5) = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333.

So 1 + 0.002333 = 1.002333.

Then T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ T2 * (1 - 0.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So T1 is approximately 0.997667 T2.

So now, the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T1)^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ (T2)^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 is ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )

Simplify:

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (T1^4)/(T2^4) = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T1 = 0.997667 T2, so T1/T2 = 0.997667.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute 0.997667^4.

Break it down: 0.997667 is approximately 1 - 0.002333.

Calculating (1 - x)^4 where x is 0.002333.

The binomial expansion: 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4.

x=0.002333.

x² = approx 0.00000544.

x³= ~0.0000000126.

x^4= ~0.00000000003.

So:

1 -4x = 1 - 0.009332 = 0.990668.

+6x² = +0.00003264 → 0.990668 + 0.00003264 = 0.99070064.

-4x³ = -4 * 1.26e-8 → negligible, about 0.00000005e-3.

So adding that, it's approximately 0.99070064.

Then + x^4 (which is 3e-10) is negligible.

So (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural logarithm.

ln(0.997667) = ?

We can approximate ln(1 - x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x^3/3...

x=0.002333.

ln(0.997667) ≈ -0.002333 - (0.002333)^2 /2.

= -0.002333 - (0.00000544)/2 ≈ -0.002333 - 0.00000272 ≈ -0.00233572.

Multiply by 4: 4 * ln(0.997667) ≈ -0.00934288.

So ln(L1/L2) = ln(2.25) + 4 ln(0.997667) ≈ ln(2.25) + (-0.00934288).

Compute ln(2.25) ≈ 0.81093.

So ln(L1/L2) ≈ 0.81093 - 0.00934288 ≈ 0.801587.

Exponentiating: e^0.801587 ≈ ?

e^0.8 is about 2.2255. Let me compute 0.801587:

The difference from 0.8 is 0.001587.

e^0.801587 ≈ e^0.8 * e^0.001587 ≈ 2.2255 * (1 + 0.001587 + (0.001587)^2/2 )

0.001587^2 ≈ 2.52e-6, so 0.00000252.

So ≈ 2.2255 * (1.001587 + 0.00000126) ≈ 2.2255 * 1.001588 ≈ 2.2255 * 1.001588 ≈ 2.2255 + (2.2255 *0.001588).

2.2255 *0.001588 ≈ 0.003535.

So approximately 2.2255 + 0.003535 = 2.2290.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25 → higher than our calculated 2.229.

B) ~2.32 → higher.

C) ~2.35 → higher.

D) ~2.23 → close.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (0.997667)^4 numerically.

Let me compute 0.997667^4.

Compute step by step:

0.997667^2 = ?

0.997667 * 0.997667.

Compute 1 - 0.002333 twice.

Approximately, (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a=0.002333 → 2a = 0.004666, a²=0.00000544.

So 1 - 0.004666 + 0.00000544 = 0.99533944.

Wait, but that's for (1 - a)^2, but wait, 0.997667 is 1 -0.002333. So squared is (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a +a².

So 1 - 2*(0.002333) = 1 - 0.004666 = 0.995334.

Plus a²: 0.00000544 → 0.995334 + 0.00000544 = 0.99533944.

So 0.997667^2 ≈ 0.995339.

Now, square that to get the fourth power.

0.995339^2 = ?

Again, (1 - b)^2 where b=0.004661.

So 1 - 2b + b².

2b = 0.009322, b²= (0.004661)^2 ≈ 0.0000217.

So 1 - 0.009322 = 0.990678.

Plus b²: 0.0000217 → 0.990678 +0.0000217 ≈ 0.9906997.

So (0.997667)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So back to the L ratio.

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.9907) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Calculate 2.25 * 0.9907.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should use more precise values for the velocity. Let me compute the exact value of (700 km/s)/c.

c is 299,792 km/s. So 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002336.

So 1 + v_r/c = 1.002336.

So T1 = T2 / 1.002336.

Compute 1 / 1.002336 → approximately 0.997664.

So T1/T2 = 0.997664.

So (T1/T2)^4 = (0.997664)^4.

We can compute 0.997664^4 with more precision.

Let me compute 0.997664^2:

0.997664 * 0.997664.

= (1 - 0.002336)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002336 + (0.002336)^2.

= 1 - 0.004672 + 0.000005457.

= 0.995333 + 0.000005457 ≈ 0.995338.

Now square 0.995338:

= (1 - 0.004662)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004662 + (0.004662)^2.

= 1 - 0.009324 + 0.00002175.

= 0.990676 + 0.00002175 ≈ 0.99069775.

So (0.997664)^4 ≈ ~0.99069775.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99069775 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99069775.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99069775.

Let me compute 2 * 0.99069775 = 1.9813955.

0.25 * 0.99069775 = 0.2476744375.

Adding together: 1.9813955 + 0.2476744375 ≈ 2.2290699375.

So approximately 2.2291, which is approximately 2.23.

So the ratio is about 2.23, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the answer would be 2.25 (option A), but considering the Doppler effect, the actual ratio is a bit less than 2.25, approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


Astronomers are comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem provides the following key information:

1. **Radius and Mass**: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. However, the mass-to-radius relationship is not directly relevant to the calculation of luminosity in this context.

2. **Peak Wavelengths**: The observed peak wavelengths (λ_max) at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Using Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature, the observed λ_max depends on the star's rest wavelength and its radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.

3. **Radial Velocities**: Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The Doppler effect shifts the observed wavelength of Star_2, so its observed λ_max is longer (redshifted) compared to its rest wavelength. Since both stars have the same observed λ_max, Star_1's rest wavelength must be shorter than Star_2's rest wavelength, implying that Star_1 is hotter than Star_2.

4. **Luminosity Calculation**: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
   \[
   L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
   \]
   Since \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), the radius ratio squared is \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). The temperature ratio \( T_1 / T_2 \) is determined from the Doppler shift. Using the relativistic Doppler effect formula:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_2 / c}
   \]
   where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002336} \approx 0.997664
   \]
   Raising this to the fourth power:
   \[
   \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.9907
   \]
   Substituting into the luminosity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.229
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated luminosity ratio of approximately 2.229 matches closest to option D, which is ~2.23.

**Critical Analysis of Options**:
- **A) ~2.25**: This would be the ratio if the stars had the same temperature, but the Doppler shift reduces the ratio slightly, so this is too high.
- **B) ~2.32** and **C) ~2.35**: These are even higher and inconsistent with the calculated value.
- **D) ~2.23**: This matches the calculated value of 2.229 and is the correct answer.

**Answer**: D
