Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- group or something similar. Wait, no, esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R, right? So the FTIR has a peak for an ester, which suggests an ester functional group is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two signals correspond to aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can affect the aromatic protons. If the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two types: the ortho and para to the substituents. Wait, di-substituted... so maybe two substituents are in the ring. Let's think about the substitution pattern.

The NMR has two aromatic signals. That could mean either two different types of aromatic protons. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents would cause the aromatic ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. Or maybe in the ortho positions? Wait, no, di-substituted could be meta or para. Hmm. Wait, if it's para, then the aromatic protons would be two sets: the two ortho and the two meta. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let me imagine a benzene ring with two substituents, say, X and Y in para positions. Then the ring would have two sets of equivalent H: the two H next to X on either side (ortho) and the two H next to Y on either side (but since it's para, those are actually the same as the ortho positions to Y). Wait, no, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite. So the aromatic H would be in two sets: the two H adjacent to substituent A (ortho), and the two H between substituent A and substituent B (meta), but wait, maybe in the para case, the ring is symmetric, so perhaps the aromatic H are all equivalent? No, that's not right because para substitution can create a situation where the ring has two sets of equivalent H. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic H would be in two groups: the two H ortho to substituent A, and the two H meta to substituent A. But I'm not sure; perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such positions that the aromatic H are split into two signals. So, perhaps the di-substituted ring has two substituents which are adjacent, like ortho positions. Then the aromatic H would have more complex splitting, but I'm not sure.

Moving on. The NMR also has two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond. So, perhaps the compound has a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but where is the double bond? Ester groups don't have a double bond (they have a carbonyl
