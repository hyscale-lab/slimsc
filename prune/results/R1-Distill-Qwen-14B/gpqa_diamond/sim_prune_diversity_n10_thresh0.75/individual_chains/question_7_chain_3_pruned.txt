Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is: At what energy do gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs? The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

I remember that the process in question is gamma-gamma annihilation, which produces electron-positron pairs. The lifetime of the gamma-rays would be limited if the annihilation happens quickly, so we need to find the energy where the mean free path becomes too short, making the gamma-rays' lifetime significant only if they don't annihilate quickly.

Wait, I think the mean free time for annihilation is important here. The lifetime (or mean lifetime) of the gamma-ray photon is determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. So the lifetime τ is 1/Γ, where Γ is the annihilation rate.

The annihilation rate Γ should depend on the cross-section σ and the number density n of the target photons (CMB photons in this case). So Γ ≈ σ * n * v, where v is the relative velocity. But since we're dealing with high-energy gamma-rays, maybe we can approximate the CMB photons as stationary (for the gamma's frame), so v is roughly the speed of light.

Wait, but the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into electrons depends on the center-of-mass energy. The process γγ → e+e- is possible only if the combined energy of the two photons is at least the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV, so 1.022 MeV. So for the reaction to happen, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be above this threshold.

But in our case, the gamma-ray is high energy, and the CMB photon is low energy (1e-3 eV). So the center-of-mass energy squared (s) is given by s = (E_γ + E_CMB)^2 - (p_γ c + p_CMB c)^2. Since E_CMB is much smaller than E_γ, and since the CMB photon is non-relativistic (E << pc), but wait, no, for low energy photons, their momentum is E/(c) if non-relativistic, but for higher energies, it's different. Wait, actually, the relation is E = pc for massless particles like photons.

Wait, for a photon, energy E = pc, so p = E/(c). So the CMB photon's momentum is E_CMB/(c), and the gamma's is E_γ/(c). So the invariant s is (E_γ + E_CMB)^2 - (E_γ/(c) c + E_CMB/(c) c)^2) = (E_γ + E_CMB)^2 - (E_γ + E_CMB)^2) ?

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since both
