Okay, so I've got this question about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Hmm, let's break it down.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So the ring itself is six carbons, and the substituents add two more. Wait, wait, di-substituted means two substituent groups attached. So the ring is like benzene, but with two groups attached. Each substituent must have one carbon each because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8 total carbons. Oh wait, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, because di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent must be one carbon each. So maybe two methyl groups or something else.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So there's a halogen attached to the ring, probably. And a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. Let me think. Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring could be a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, the ring has six carbons, and the substituents add two more. So, the substituents are probably each a single group. If the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen, then each is one substituent. So the molecule
