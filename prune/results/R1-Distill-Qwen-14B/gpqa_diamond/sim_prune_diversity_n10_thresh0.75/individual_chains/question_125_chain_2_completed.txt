Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Oh right, the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is the sum of three 1D harmonic oscillators, one in each direction. But since it's isotropic, all directions are the same, so we can treat it as a radial problem.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different energy expressions and multiplicities.

Hmm, I remember that in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each state depends on the quantum numbers in each direction, but since it's isotropic, it's often more convenient to use the radial quantum number. Alternatively, sometimes people use the total quantum number n, which combines the contributions from each direction.

Wait, wait, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be expressed as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0,1,2,...). But wait, no, wait another thought. Oh wait, in each direction (x, y, z), the energy is (n_x + 1/2) ħω, so the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Since n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...), the total n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy levels are at E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n can be 0,1,2, etc. Each state is characterized by the triplet (n_x, n_y, n_z), but they all have the same n.

Wait, okay, so the energy depends on n = n_x + n_y +n_z. So the ground state is n=0, first excited state n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. So the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy E would be (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, 3 is from n=3, plus 3/2 is 3 + 1.5=4.5, which is 9/2. So E = (9/2) ħω.

That's the first part of the answer. Now for the second part, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, how many states have n=3.

Each state is determined by the triplet (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. We need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. This is a combinatorial problem.

The number of ways to distribute 3 quanta among three directions. The formula for the number of solutions is (n +3-1 choose 3-1) ) where n is the total, which is 3. So (3 +2 choose 2) )= (5 choose 2) )= 10.

So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10 → that matches.

Option B: some other expression with 10. But the energy would be (9/2) ħω, so B's energy is wrong.

Option C: (9/2) ħω but with 3 states. No, that's wrong.

Option D: wrong energy and multiplicity.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given as \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and can be expressed as \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions.

The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches the calculated energy and the number of eigenfunctions.
- **Option B**: The energy is incorrect, though the number of eigenfunctions is correct.
- **Option C**: The energy is correct, but the number of eigenfunctions is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Both the energy and the number of eigenfunctions are incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
