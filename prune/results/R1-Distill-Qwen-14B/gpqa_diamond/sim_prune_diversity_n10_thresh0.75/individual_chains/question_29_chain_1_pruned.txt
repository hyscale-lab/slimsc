Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley mutants and anti-nutritional compounds. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound, probably by mutating the gene so it doesn't produce it anymore.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember causes point mutations, usually by adding methyl groups. So the mutations are likely point changes.

Looking at the sequencing data, the changes are in the first exon area. The intact gene and the mutants are given. I need to figure out which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. That probably means disrupting the gene's function—so a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a change in the protein structure that makes it non-functional.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Change: Second triplet from ATG is TTC in intact, becomes TCT in Mutant 1? Wait, let's see. Let me compare each position.

Wait, the sequences are written in the 5' to 3' direction, so each codon is every three nucleotides. Let me parse them as such.

Intact gene:

ATG TTC TCG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, wait, perhaps better to break it into triplets:

ATG TTC TCG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Wait, that's a bit confusing because the way it's written, some triplets might not be correct. Let me see:

Intact gene:
First few codons (assuming each 3 nucleotides is a codon):
ATG TTC TCG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, perhaps I should think of the sequence as a series of 3-letter chunks.

But let's look at the mutations in each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, comparing to the intact gene, which was:

ATG TTC TCG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, looking at each codon:

First codon: same (ATG).
Second codon: TTC in wild type becomes TCT in mutant 1. So, TTC is Ser, TCT is also Ser. So same amino acid. So no change here.
Third codon: TCG in wild type, becomes TAC in mutant 1. TCG is Ser, TAC is Tyr. So that's a change from Ser to Tyr. Not a frameshift, so a point mutation. If that's the only change, it's a missense mutation. So the protein might still be functional, but perhaps it's altered. Not sure if that would eliminate the compound.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Triplets:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Comparing to wild type:

Third codon: TCG -> TAA. TCG is Ser, TAA is Stop. Oh, wait, TAA is a stop codon. So in Mutant 2, the third codon becomes a stop codon. That would cause the protein to terminate early, leading to a shorter, probably nonfunctional protein. That could eliminate the compound if the gene product is responsible for it.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Triplets:

ATG TTC TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, let me parse that again. So:

First codon: ATG.
Second: TTC. Same as wild type.
Third: TTA. Wild type is TCG (Ser). TTA is Leu. So changed from Ser to Leu. Then fourth codon: CGC (Arg), wild type may have been next part. Wait, perhaps I should compare each part.

Wait, the intact gene's third codon is TCG, which is Ser. In mutant 3, it's TTA. So that's a change to Leu. So that's a missense mutation. Then, in the next codon, maybe an insertion or deletion? Or perhaps a different change. Wait, looking at the rest, in Mutant 3, the next part after TTA is CGC. In the wild type, after TCG, it's GCT (Ala). So maybe in the mutant, the third codon is TTA, then CGC comes next. So the sequence is shifted differently. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm breaking it into triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant 3 has a longer change. Let me see:

In the wild type, the first part is ATG TTC TCG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

In Mutant 3, the sequence is ATG TTC TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT … TGA.

Wait, so after the TTC (second codon), the third codon in wild type is TCG, but in Mutant 3 it's TTA (Leu). Then the next codons are CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TTT (Phe), etc. So perhaps an insertion or a frameshift? Because the triplet reading is changing. Wait, but the length of the sequence is the same? Because in the mutant, the sequence might have a different number of nucleotides, but the question says they sequenced the target gene and found changes in the first exon—so perhaps the exons are the same length, so it's not a frameshift. So maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The problem says the mutation is in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here is in the coding sequence.

Looking at the options, the question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would happen if the gene is non-functional—either a premature stop codon or a
