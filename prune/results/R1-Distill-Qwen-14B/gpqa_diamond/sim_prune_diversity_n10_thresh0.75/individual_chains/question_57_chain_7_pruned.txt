Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, which are all some numbers with units of fm. Wait, what's fm? Oh right, femtometers, 1e-15 meters, common in nuclear physics.

Wait, elastic scattering—so this is probably related to the scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis. I remember that the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. Let me think.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all the partial waves. The formula I recall is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (δ_l - lπ) e^{iδ_l} (something) ) Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh, right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of phase shifts δ_l is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (δ_l - lπ) e^{iδ_l} ) * ( (2l+1) ) ) * ... Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, which is along the incident beam direction (θ=0), might be simpler.

Wait, I think I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum of (δ_l - lπ) * e^{iδ_l} for each l. Or maybe the sum is over (something else). But since we're only considering the imaginary part, and along the incident direction, perhaps only the zeroth-order term (l=0) contributes significantly, but wait no, because all the phase shifts are given.

Wait, let's think again. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( δ_l - lπ ) e^{iδ_l} (2l + 1) ) ] * P
