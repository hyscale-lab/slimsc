Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable because it's a small number, so I can probably list all the possible states and calculate the energy for each.

First, let's think about how the energy is calculated. The formula E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So the sum inside the brackets can vary.

Wait, let me think about each term. For example, when all three spins are aligned, say all +1, then each S_i S_j is +1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 would be 1+1+1 =3. Then E would be -J*(3) = -3J.

Alternatively, if two spins are +1 and one is -1, what happens? Let's see. Let's pick S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 =-1. So E= -J*(-1) = J.

Wait another case: if all are -1. Then each S_i
