Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll try to parse out the reactions given. The problem mentions several reactions, so I'll list them out to get a clearer picture.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. Hmm, what kind of compounds react in an 8:1 molar ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Sulfur is bright red in some forms. Or perhaps another red solid.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E. And E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like phosgene (which is toxic), but wait, phosgene is O=CCl2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe something else like a cyanide compound? Or perhaps a highly reactive gas.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak, but wait, H2S is a weak acid but not commonly formed in such reactions. Alternatively, maybe sulfuric acid (H2SO4) but that's a strong acid, but what other acid? Wait, another possibility: if C is something like SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Or perhaps, considering other possibilities.

Wait, let me think about possible structures. If C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), then reacting with water would produce H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But for two different acids, maybe another component is involved. Alternatively, if C is something else, like a sulfite or sulfate?

Wait, perhaps C is SO3. Because when SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me go back to the first reaction.
