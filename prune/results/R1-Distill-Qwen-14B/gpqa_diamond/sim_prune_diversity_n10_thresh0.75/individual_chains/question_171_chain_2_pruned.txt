Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, let's see. The question gives six different benzene derivatives and asks about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Then I have to arrange them in order from lowest to highest.

Wait, each substance is an aromatic compound with a substituent. The substituent's nature will influence where the bromine addsâ€”para, meta, or ortho. But since bromine is in excess, maybe it's a di-substitution or mono? Oh, wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each reacts to form a mono-brominated product. So the para and ortho and meta isomers' yields depend on the directing groups of the substituents.

Right, substituents can be activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directors. Let me recall:

- Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are activating and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.
- Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2, -COOH) are deactivating and direct to meta positions.

Wait, what about each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the incoming Br would go preferably to para and ortho positions.

Wait
