Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Let me think. Each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each to find the partition function.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8. The energy expression depends on the products of the spins. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let's see, the total energy is -J times the sum of these products.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be different values depending on the spins. Let me figure out the possible values of this sum.

Each product term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. Let's denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So S can range from -3 to +3, but not all values are possible. Let's see what possible values S can take.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible configurations. Let me consider different cases:

Case 1: All spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3 = +1 or all = -1.

In that case, each product S_i S_j is 1. So S = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So the energy E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 =1*1=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. So sum S=1-1-1 = -1.

But wait, depending on which spin is -1, the sum might be the same.

Alternatively, another way: when two are same and one different, how does the sum look?

Wait, let me think again. For two up and one down.

Let me compute the sum S for S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:

S = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1
