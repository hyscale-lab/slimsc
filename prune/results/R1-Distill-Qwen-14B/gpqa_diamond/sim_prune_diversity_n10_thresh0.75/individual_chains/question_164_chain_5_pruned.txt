Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, binary star systems and their masses. Alright, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their radial velocities can tell us about their masses.

So the question is about two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between primary eclipses. Then, in system_1, the radial velocity (RV) variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of a system is the sum of the masses of the two stars. So I need to find the mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, how do I relate radial velocities to mass? Oh right, in a binary system, each star orbits the center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, so it moves slower, and the less massive star moves faster. So the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars are inversely proportional to their masses. The star with the larger mass has a smaller RV amplitude.

So if system_1 has RV amplitudes 10 and 5, then one star is twice as massive as the other. Because the more massive one has a smaller velocity. So mass_1a = 2 * mass_1b? Wait, no, let me think again. The mass is inversely proportional to the velocity. So if m1 and m2 are the two masses, then m1/m2 = v2/v1. Because m1 * v1 = m2 * v2 (since the center of mass is the same point, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction).

So for system_1: v1 =10, v2=5. So m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 1/2. So m1 is half of m2? Wait no, m1 is the mass of the first star, m2 the second. So m1 = (v2 * m_total) / (v1 + v2), maybe? Or perhaps I should set up the ratio differently.

Wait, let me think again. The system's total mass is M = m1 + m2. The velocity of each star is proportional to the other star's mass. Because the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so smaller velocity.

So, m1/m2 = v2/v1. Right, because m1*v1 = m2*v2. So for system_1, v1=10, v2=5. So m1/m2 = 5/10 = 1/2. So m1 is half of m2. So the total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = (1/2 m2) + m2 = (3/2 m2). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, m1 = (m2 * v2) / v1. Wait, another approach.

Let me think: from m1 * v1
