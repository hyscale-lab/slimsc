Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It happens in 1,5-dienes, which are conjugated. The reaction typically forms another 1,5-diene but with a different structure, usually bicyclic compounds.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene derivative. The 'hept' part tells me it's a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. So the structure has two bridges, each two carbons long and one bridge with a single carbon. So, like, a bicyclic structure.

Wait, the substituents here are 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. Oh, right, 2-azabicyclo indicates that one of the bridgehead carbons is nitrogen. So the bridgehead at position 2 is a nitrogen. Wait, no, wait. The numbering for bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane: the bridgeheads are positions 1, 2, and 5? Wait, no, the bicyclo system... Let me think. The numbering starts at one bridgehead, then the next carbons are numbered around. For [2.2.1], the bridgeheads are at positions 1, 2, and 5? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule is a norbornene with a vinyl group at position 2 and a nitrogen also at position 2. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, azabicyclo means that one of the bridgehead carbons is a nitrogen. So, the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a nitrogen at one of the bridgehead positions. Let me imagine the structure: the bicyclo system has two rings, and the 5-ene is one of the double bonds in the ring. So, the structure is a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Now, the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azab
