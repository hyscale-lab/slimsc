Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to understand what's going on.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed was passed through some tubes. The results are given: tube 1 (with Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60g, tube 3 (with red-hot copper) gained 0.80g, and tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A to D, with numbers 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm. Let's break this down. So, when salts A and B are heated without air, they decompose into gases. The gases pass through these tubes, which probably react with them.

First, tube 1 is anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. When it reacts with water vapor, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water. So the 3.60g increase in tube 1 must be due to water vapor.

Then, tube 3 has red-hot copper. Red-hot copper in a tube probably means it's reacting with a gas. Since Cu is heated, maybe it reacts with CO2 or some other gas. Wait, I think when CO2 is passed over hot copper, it doesn't react. But if it's SO3 or another acid anhydride, maybe? Or maybe it's reacting with a sulfur-containing gas. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S? No, wait, H2S would react with CuO, but I'm not sure. Wait, if the gas is CO, it might not react, but maybe if it's something like H2, but that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: when SO2 gas is passed over red-hot copper, it doesn't react. But if the gas is, say, H2S, then maybe. Alternatively, if the gas is CO, then maybe. Hmm.

But looking at the data, tube 3 gained 0.80g. The problem states that CuO is formed in tube 3. So, the gas must be reacting with the copper to form CuO.

What reactions can produce CuO when a gas is passed over red-hot copper? Let's think. Maybe the gas is H2S? Because when H2S is passed over hot copper, it might decompose. Wait, or perhaps the gas is sulfur vapor? No, that's probably not. Another thought: Maybe the gas is CO2. If CO2 is passed over red-hot copper, it doesn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O vapor, but that seems unlikely as it would have been absorbed by tube 1.

Wait, but the tube 3 gained 0.80g, and it's forming CuO. So, perhaps the gas is H2S. Because H2S when passed over hot copper might decompose, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think about the elements involved. The gas that tube 3 reacts with must be something that, when reacted with copper, produces CuO and perhaps another product. So, for example, SO3 gas would react with Cu to form CuO and SO2 or something, but I'm not certain. Let me think of the possible reactions.

Another possibility is that the gas is a sulfur-containing compound. For example, H2S might be oxidized, but I'm not exactly remembering the reaction. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a halide, like HCl? But HCl would react with CuO, but not with the metal itself
