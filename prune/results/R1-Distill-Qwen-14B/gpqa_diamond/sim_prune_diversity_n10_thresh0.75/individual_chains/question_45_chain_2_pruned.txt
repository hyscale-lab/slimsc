Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such wells, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. Each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they have spin up or spin down. But wait, how does spin affect the energy? Oh right, for distinguishable particles, spin doesn't influence the energy because it's a separate degree of freedom. But wait, these are fermions because they're spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh, right! So each quantum state can be occupied by at most one fermion.

The well is one-dimensional and of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), and they've given E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, the problem is for four identical fermions. So I need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle. Each unique quantum state can be occupied by only one particle. Since the particles are in a 1D well, their quantum state is determined by their quantum number n and their spin. Spin can be either up or down, so each n can accommodate two particles (with opposite spins).

So for four particles, I need to fill up the lowest available energy levels, making sure that each state
