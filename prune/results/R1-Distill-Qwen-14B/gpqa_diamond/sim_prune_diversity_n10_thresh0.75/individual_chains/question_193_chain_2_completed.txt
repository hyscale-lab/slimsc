Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller. The formula I remember is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs maybe. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, let me substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. Wait no, wait. Let's see:

N ∝ 1 / plx^5. But since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d, so 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe I'm looking at the differential, like how N changes as r (distance) increases.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume depends on distance. Oh wait, maybe the number of stars in a volume element depends on the distance.

Wait, another approach. The number of stars should be a function of the volume, but since stars are spread out, the number density could be varying. Let's think in terms of N being the number of stars in a certain volume. The volume in 3D space would be (distance cubed), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the number of stars observed with a given parallax is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, how many stars do we see? But parallax relates to distance. So I'm trying to find how N changes as a function of distance. So let's express N in terms of d.

Since plx = 1/d, then N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's for a specific parallax. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the problem says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So when you look at a region, the number of stars you count depends on how far away those stars are.

Wait, considering that stars are at various distances. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be how many? Well, the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dr. If the number density of stars is n, then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But wait, the question gives N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that seems to suggest that the number of stars increases rapidly with distance, which doesn't make sense because at larger distances, you can't see as many stars. Or can you?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the initial setup. Let me restate the problem. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (which means large distance), the number of stars increases as 1/plx^5. Because plx is small, 1/plx^5 is large, so N is large. So as d increases (plx decreases), N increases as d^5. So N increases rapidly with distance. But that's counterintuitive because I thought that as you go further, you can't see as many stars because they're dimmer or farther apart.

Wait, but this might be a case where the number of stars in a given region is determined by some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the number of stars is proportional to the volume, but that's not being considered here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number of stars per distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = k * d^5 * 4πd² dr, because the volume is 4πd² dr. Oh wait, but no, because the initial statement is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5, but in reality the volume element is d^2 dr. So maybe the number of stars in each shell (per unit distance) would be proportional to d^5 multiplied by the area (d^2) and dr. Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. So perhaps the number per unit distance would be proportional to d^5 * d^2 = d^7. That can't be right, because the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again. The given is N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. So if the distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But that seems very high. Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in that region. So per unit range (per unit increase in distance), the number of stars would be proportional to the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, because the number of stars in a small range dr is dN = (dN/dd) * dr. So dN/dd is the number of stars per unit distance.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Wait the options are given as ~ r^something, so perhaps the answer is r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on whether I'm considering the correct approach. Let me think: the number of stars observed at a distance d is N ∝ d^5. So for each increment in d (dr), the number of stars increases by 5 d^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr=1) would be proportional to d^4, which is option C.

Wait, but another way to think: the number of stars in a given area (per unit area) and per unit distance. Because when you observe the sky, you're looking in all directions (4π steradians), but we might be considering a per unit area basis as well. But perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, the number of stars with a parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N ∝ dplx * (plx)^{-5} ). But since plx is 1/d, dplx = - (1/d^2) dd. Hmm, perhaps that's getting too into calculus.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx = 1/d, 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So the number density is n = k d^5. Then, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV = k d^5 * dV.

But dV in spherical shells is 4π d^2 dd. So N = k d^5 * 4π d^2 dd = 4 π k d^7 dd. So the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd at distance d is proportional to d^7. So the number of stars per unit distance (dd=1) is proportional to d^7, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the initial approach: N ∝ d^5. The question is, how does the number of stars change with distance? So the number increases as d^5. So if you have a region, as you go further, the number of stars increases by that factor. But when considering the change per unit distance (the rate at which N changes with r), that would be the derivative, which is 5 d^4, so proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but the original question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, then N ∝ d^5.

But if we're considering a small range in d (like a thin shell), the number of stars in that shell would be N = (number per volume) * volume of shell. Volume of shell is 4π d² dr. So N = (d^5) * 4π d² dr = 4 π d^7 dr. So the number per unit dr is proportional to d^7, but the question is about per unit range, so that's the N per dr, which is d^7, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question isn't about the number in a shell, but the number per unit area or something else.

Wait, another thought: in astronomy, when we count stars, the number we see depends on their brightness and distance. The flux received from a star falls off as 1/d^2, but the number of stars that are bright enough to be seen also depends on d. So perhaps the initial relation is not about volume but just about how many are in a certain area. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So N = k d^5. So the number increases as the fifth power of the distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, so the rate of change (the derivative) would be dN/dr = 5 k d^4. So per unit range, the number increases as r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer would be C.


The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), which gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we consider the rate of change of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Among the given options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \)**: Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \)**: Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of distance.

Answer: C
