Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question involves organic reactions and HPLC chromatography. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

So, the setup is that a chemist performs two reactions. Both are using mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right, it adds an epoxide group across the double bond.

Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid. The reactions go to completion, so 100% conversion.

Wait, so what happens when an alkene reacts with mCPBA? Epoxidation. The double bond becomes an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product, right? Because mCPBA is an electrophilic reagent; it adds across the double bond in a specific way.

For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the initial epoxidation would produce different epoxide structures. But then, when you do aqueous acid work-up, the epoxide ring opens. How does that work?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening via acid catalysis. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack. In aqueous acid, water is the nucleophile.

Wait
