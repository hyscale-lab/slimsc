Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry. The common ones include things like D4h, C2, etc. So, I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular structure, and from there deduce its symmetry.

Let me break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think what reacts with 8 moles of another substance. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Wait, 8 equivalents—could A be a metal with a +2 charge? Let's see, 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. So, if A is a diatomic molecule or maybe a metal with a valency that would require 8 equivalent moles of B.

Wait, 8 equivalents makes me think of something like O in water, but maybe not. Alternatively, think of aluminum reacting with something. Wait, 8 equivalents might imply a 1:8 ratio. So maybe A is a metal with a valency that would require 8 equivalents of B. Let's say A is Fe (iron), which has a valency of +2 or +3. But 8 equivalents would imply a reaction that uses 8 moles of B per mole of A. Hmm, perhaps B is a diatomic molecule like Cl2. Wait, but 8 Cl2 per A? That seems high. Alternatively, A might be something like Na (sodium), but that would pair with Cl in a 1:1 ratio, so not 8.

Wait, another thought. Maybe A is a metal oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Let me think about the product being bright red. Bright red products—could that be something like FeCl3? No, FeCl3 is more yellowish. Maybe it's SO2?
