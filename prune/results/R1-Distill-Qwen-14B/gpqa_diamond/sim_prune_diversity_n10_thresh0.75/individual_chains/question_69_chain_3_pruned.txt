Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the CERN Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. So the observed lifetime, τ, would be longer than τ₀. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, Lorentz factor is γ = E/(m c²), right? Oh wait, E here is the total energy of the particle. So since the energy is given as 27 GeV and the mass is 3.41 GeV, I can calculate γ.

Let me plug in the numbers: γ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let's see, 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 3.41 * 7.9 is about 27 (since 3.41*8=27.28). So maybe around 7.92 or so. Let me compute it more accurately: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 -23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is approximately 0.917. So total γ is approximately 7.917.

So γ is about 7.917. Then the observed lifetime τ is 7.917 multiplied by 8e-16 seconds. Let me calculate that: 7.917 * 8 = 63.336; so τ ≈ 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part. I think the problem is about the length over which the decay can be observed. Because the particles decay after traveling some distance in the chamber. The resolution of the chamber must be good enough to detect the decay products within a certain length so that they don't fly away too much. If the length isn't resolved, the tracks might not be visible or could be confused with other events.

So the minimum distance the particle would travel before decaying is called the decay length. The average decay length L is c * τ, where c is the speed of light. Because in the lab frame, the particle is moving at speed v ≈ c (since it's highly relativistic, given the energy is much larger than mass), so L ≈ c * τ.

Wait, but the decay length is the average distance. So using L = c * τ. Let's compute that.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. τ is 6.3336e-15 seconds. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s = 3 *6.3336 *1e-7 = 19.0008e-7 meters. Which is 1.90008e-6 meters. Wait, that's 1.90008 * 1e-6 meters, which is about 1.90 micrometers.

Wait, but why 30% of the decays? Oh right, because the question says "to observe at least 30% of the decays", which implies that the minimum resolution (the detector must be able to see at least 30% of the decays). So the decay length for 30% of the decays is when L is the 30% point, which I think is related to the mean lifetime. Wait, but the average is L_avg = c * τ.

Wait, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(c τ₀)). Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = γ τ₀. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time and the lab frame.

Wait, another approach: The decay probability as a function of time is given by the exponential decay law. The number of decays before a certain time t is N = N₀ (1 - exp(-t/τ)). But in the lab frame, the time experienced by the particle is
