Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Hmm. Let's see. The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out what are the possible decay channels at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, that doesn't look quite right. Maybe I misread it. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh, perhaps it's more like L(y) = -λ X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, no. Another possibility: since the question mentions that the boson X interacts with fermions, perhaps the interaction term is something like L = λ X ψ_f ψ_f. So, X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the interaction term is proportional to X times ψ_f times ψ_f, which would mean that X can decay into a pair of fermions. But which fermions are possible?

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle.

So I need to look at all possible fermions and their masses. Let me list the known fermions and their approximate masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV, so X can't decay into t tbar since 173*2 is way over 6.

Wait, but wait. Do we consider the masses of the fermions when they are bound in hadrons? No, because in particle decays, we're considering the production of elementary particles, not hadrons. So when X decays, it can produce a pair of quarks, but these would form hadrons (like mesons), but the decay products would be detected as jets or other hadronic activity. However, for the purposes of kinematic limits, we can consider the masses of the individual quarks, but wait, this might not be entirely correct. Because in reality, if X is a boson, like a scalar, it can decay into a quark-antiquark pair, but the quarks would then form hadrons. But in terms of the allowed decay, the mass of the quark pair must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, but another approach: the mass of the pair is 2*m_fermion. So for each fermion, we check if 2*m_fermion is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's compute 2*m_fermion for each possible fermion:

- e: 0.001 GeV → way less than 6. So e+ e- is allowed.
- mu: 0.21 GeV → allowed.
- tau: 3.554 GeV → allowed since 3.554 <6.
- u: 0.007 GeV → allowed.
- d: 0.01 GeV → allowed.
- s: 0.19 GeV → allowed.
- c: 2.55 GeV → allowed since 2.55 <6.
- b: 8.26 GeV → 8.26 >6 → so b and anti-b cannot be produced.

Wait wait, but the bottom quark has a mass of around 4.13 GeV, so 2*4.13 is 8.26. That's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b.

Top quark is way more, so no.

So the allowed fermion pairs would be any pair where 2*m_fermion ≤6 GeV.

So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but let me think about the interaction term again. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo. Wait, perhaps the correct form is L = λ X ψ_f ψ_f, so that the interaction is X coupling to a fermion and anti-fermion. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to X's mass. But wait, in reality, the coupling term would depend on the type of fermion. But in this problem, perhaps it's assumed that X couples to all fermions, but the decay is possible only if 2*m_fermion ≤6 GeV.

So the possible decay products are any fermion pair where their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

Electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau), up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c). Because for each of these, 2*m_fermion is less than or equal to 6 GeV (except b, which is more).

Wait, let me calculate each:

e: 0.0005 GeV → 2*0.0005=0.001. Yes.
mu: 0.105 → 0.21. Yes.
tau: 1.777 → 3.554. Yes.
u: 0.0035 → 0.007. Yes.
d: 0.005 → 0.01. Yes.
s: 0.095 → 0.19. Yes.
c: 1.275 → 2.55. Yes.
b: 4.13 → 8.26 >6. No.

So the allowed fermion pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b, s s, etc. But b is not allowed. So option A is wrong.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So that's all except b and top. So option B is possible.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible because 2*m_t is way above 6 GeV. So option C is out.

Option D: includes b b-bar. So it's wrong.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option A: X→b b, s s, u u, d d, tau tau, e e.

So includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B: X→c c, s s, u u, d d, tau tau, mu mu, e e.

That's all except b and top. So that's correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but also t. So no.

Option D: X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct allowed decays are as in option B.

Wait, but what about the charge? The X is a boson, so it's neutral. The fermion pairs must be neutral as well. Wait, wait. The decay products must be a fermion and antifermion, which is neutral overall. So all the options only include pairs like e+ e- which are neutral, so that's fine.

So the allowed decays are any fermion-antifermion pair where 2*m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

The approximate masses of the fermions are as follows:
- \( e \): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( u \): \( 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( d \): \( 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( s \): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( c \): \( 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy to decay into \( t \bar{t} \))

For each fermion, the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) is checked:
- \( e \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \mu \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \tau \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( u \): \( 2m_u = 0.007 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( d \): \( 2m_d = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( s \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( c \): \( 2m_c = 2.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( b \): \( 2m_b = 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed)

Thus, the allowed decay products are \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c} \). The decays involving \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because their combined masses exceed 6 GeV.

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists all allowed decays (\( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes only the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
