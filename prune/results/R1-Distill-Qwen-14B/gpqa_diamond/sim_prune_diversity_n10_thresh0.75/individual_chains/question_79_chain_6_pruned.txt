Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question says that compound X is C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They provided the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the resulting product. I need to figure out what X was based on this data.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, right, it's a strong, bulky base. So if compound X is an epoxide, reacting it with such a base would cause the epoxide ring to open.

But wait, the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxide opening. Let's think about what the product would look like after the epoxide ring opens.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the peak. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom or a ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet methyl, same as above.
- δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, aromatic protons. Maybe from a coupling with another H.
- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet, perhaps adjacent in a benzene ring.
- δ 7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.
- δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as doublet.

The 13C NMR is:

- 21.3 (s): Probably a methyl attached to something de-shielded, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygen.
- 28.4 (s): Another methyl, perhaps a bridge or part of a cyclopropane? Or maybe a substituent on a ring.
- 126.9 (2C, s): Two carbons
