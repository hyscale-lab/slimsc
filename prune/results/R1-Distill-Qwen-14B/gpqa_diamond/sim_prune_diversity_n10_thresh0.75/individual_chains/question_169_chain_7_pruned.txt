Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay problem. Let me read it carefully. 

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. They say that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is how the E spectrum compares in this variant.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy distribution of emitted particles depends on whether the decay products are massive and how they share energy. For example, in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy, and their energies are correlated.

Wait, so in the original decay (2A→2B+2E+2V), each E would have a certain spectrum. Since E and V are much lighter, maybe they're electrons or positrons, and V could be neutrinos or something else? But the key point is that the E particles have a continuous spectrum.

Now, in the variant, the decay becomes 2A→2B + 2E + M. Wait, no, the original was 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The variant emits one M instead of two V's. So the equation would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Oh wait, the problem says "emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V." So the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, but the original decay had 2V, so I'm guessing V is a vector boson or something, but maybe it's a neutrino or another particle. But the variant replaces 2V with M. So the number of particles is changing.

In the original decay, the E's are lighter. Since E and V are emitted, and E's have a continuous spectrum, that's probably because the V's are sharing energy with them, and their energies are variable.

In the variant, instead of two V's, there's one M. If M is massless, like a photon or a neutrino, then its energy is carried away. So the E particles' energy would still have to be shared between them, but how?

Wait, let me think about the original case. In 2A→2B+2E+2V, because multiple particles are emitted, the energy and momentum conservation would lead to a situation where the E's have a range of possible energies. Hence, the continuous spectrum. The maximum energy Q would be when E takes as much energy as possible, perhaps when the other particles take minimal.

Now, in the variant, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So M is a single massless particle. Since M is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but it's massless so maybe it's like a photon, which has E=pc.

In the original case, when you have two V's, each E and V would carry away some energy and momentum. But in the variant, only one M is emitted. So maybe the dynamics change.

Wait, but in the original, there are two E's and two V's. So each E could have a range of energies, but in the variant, with two E's and one M, what happens?

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the parent is at rest (they're heavy nucleons, so probably the initial nucleus is at rest), the total momentum is zero. So the sum of the momenta of all decay products must be zero.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, so the momenta of 2B, 2E, 2V must sum to zero. But B is a heavy nucleus, so perhaps they recoil, but their mass is large, so their velocity is small, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a nucleus that splits into two B's, but the exact setup isn't given.

Wait, but the original situation is that the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That's because the V particles are taking away some energy and their energies are variable. So the E's can't all have the same energy—they can vary based on the distribution of energy.

In the variant, with one M, which is massless, the energy distribution could be different. Let's think about the energy partition. The E's and M would share the available energy. Since M is massless, its energy is all kinetic, or perhaps it's a photon, so it's emitted in a particular direction, but that's more complicated
