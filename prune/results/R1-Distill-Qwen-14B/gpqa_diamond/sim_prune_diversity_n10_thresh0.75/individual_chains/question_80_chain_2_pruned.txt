Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence and returns a number. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. And the question is, what number does ACAGTGACC give? The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, well, I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing. Let's start by looking at the first example: AGG. So the input is AGG, which is three nucleotides long. The output is 115. Let me think about how each nucleotide contributes to the total.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a number, and then summed up. Let's see. A, T, C, G are the four bases. So perhaps each has a numerical value. Let's assign numbers to each: A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or maybe another order. Let me test this with the first example.

AGG is A, G, G. So if A is 1, G is 4. Then 1 + 4 +4 =9. But the output is 115. That doesn't match. So maybe it's not a simple sum.

Alternatively, maybe each base is multiplied by its position in the sequence. Let's see.

In the first example, AGG has positions 1,2,3.

A:1 * 1 =1
G:4 *2=8
G:4 *3=12
Total:1+8+12=21. Still not 115.

Hmm, maybe the positions are 0-based? Let's try that.

Positions 0,1,2 for AGG.

A:1 *0=0
G:4 *1=4
G:4 *2=8
Sum: 12. Still not matching 115.

Maybe it's something else. Let me think about the output numbers. 115 and 176. Are these in any way related to the number of each base?

Wait, AGG has two G's and one A. So if A is 1, G is 4. Then maybe sum each base's value multiplied by their count? Let's see.

AGG: A=1, G=4. So
