Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, the well has a length L. Each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? That means they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared, since E = π² ħ²/(2mL²). So E_n = n² E.

But wait, since the particles are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But the spatial part and spin part combine to give an antisymmetric total. For identical fermions in an infinite potential well, the spatial wavefunction must be symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric, or vice versa. But I think for the purpose of energy calculation, I just need to consider the spatial part, ensuring that each particle has a unique set of quantum numbers.

Wait, but in this case, since all particles are in a 1D well, each particle's state is characterized by a single quantum number n. But for fermions, each n can hold up to a certain number of particles. Since they have spin-1/2, each n can have two particles: one spin-up and one spin-down.

Wait, no. Because the particles are identical spin-1/2 fermions, the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, and symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric. So maybe I should think about how the particles fill the energy levels, considering their spin.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle: each state can hold a maximum of two fermions (since spin 1/2 has two possible states per spatial orbital). So for each n, two particles can occupy that energy level.

But wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So let's think about the possible states.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so the lowest n's.

Each energy level can hold two particles because of spin-up and spin-down. So let's think
