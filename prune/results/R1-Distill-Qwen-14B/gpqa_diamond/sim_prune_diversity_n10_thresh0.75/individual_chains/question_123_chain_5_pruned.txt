Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. So, that means no acceleration involved—classical mechanics should work here, right? Or wait, maybe I should consider special relativity because of the high speeds involved. Oh, right, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Wait, what's the speed of light? Approximately 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is one-fifth of that. That's 0.2 times c. So, relativistic effects might come into play, like time dilation or length contraction.

But the question is asking about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, wait, so we have to find the distance from the galaxy's perspective. Let me think about the frames involved.

In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. But in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at that same speed. So, how does time work between these two frames? Because time can dilate depending on relative motion.

Wait, but according to special relativity, time intervals are not the same in different inertial frames. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame?

I remember that the time experienced in one frame (proper time) is related to the time in another frame through the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity.

Let me compute gamma here. v is 60,000 km/s, but let me convert that to m/s for calculation ease. Wait, no, maybe I can just work in km/s for the calculation since the units will cancel out. Wait, no, actually, when we square the velocity, we need to have consistent units. So, let's get everything in terms of c.

v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2 c. Because c is 300,000 km
