Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, and it's related to the area of their event horizon. Oh right, the formula involves the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius. 

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I think I need to find the radius of the event horizon first to calculate the area, then the entropy.

Wait, angular size θ is related to the actual size (like diameter) through the formula θ ≈ (size)/(distance). Oh right, because for small angles, the tangent of the angle is approximately the ratio. So θ (in radians) is roughly equal to the size divided by the distance. 

But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. How do I do that? Oh, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) radians/degree. That would be a very small angle, which makes sense for a faraway galaxy.

So the angular size is θ ≈ (2R)/(d), where R is the radius of the event horizon. Because the angular size would be the diameter over the distance, right? So 2R = θ_rad * d. Then R = (θ_rad * d)/2.

Let me compute θ_rad first. 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * π/(180) radians. Let me calculate that: 1e-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17, divided by 180, so approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, θ_rad is about 1.745e-19 radians. Distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I should convert parsecs into meters because I think the Schwarzschild radius formula uses meters. Oh right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d =
