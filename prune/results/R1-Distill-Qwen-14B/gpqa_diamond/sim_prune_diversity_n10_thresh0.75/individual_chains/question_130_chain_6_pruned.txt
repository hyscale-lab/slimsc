Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if the hydrogen clouds are neutral, they might be causing absorption, right? So when a quasar's light passes through these clouds, the hydrogen absorbs the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength.

Redshift is a key concept here. Redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of light has stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I recall is that the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) is equal to the rest wavelength (lambda_rest) multiplied by (1 + z). So lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

In this case, the rest wavelength for Lyman alpha is about 1216 Angstroms. The problem is that ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths that are in the ultraviolet. Because Earth's atmosphere absorbs UV light, so optical telescopes are limited to longer wavelengths, meaning visible light and perhaps near-infrared.

Wait, but if the cloud has a certain redshift, the absorbed light would shift into a wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. So the Lyman alpha line, which is 1216 Angstroms (which is 0.1216 micrometers, 121.6 nm), would be shifted into the optical range by a redshift.

What's the threshold for optical wavelengths? Well, the optical range for ground-based telescopes is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) up to around 700 nm (red). So the observed wavelength after redshift must be at least 400 nm to be visible.

So let's set up the equation. The observed wavelength lambda_obs should be >= 400 nm.

Given lambda_rest = 1216 Angstroms = 121.6 nm.

So lambda_obs = 121.6 * (1 + z) >= 400 nm.

Let's solve for z
