Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let's break it down. So the question is about observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and below that, the flux drops off a lot. I'm not exactly sure how that relates to the comoving distance, but maybe it's about redshift or something like that.

Wait, the question is asking about the comoving distance from Earth to the quasar. The options are in gigaparsecs, so A to D are 6, 8, 9, 7 Gpc respectively. The universe parameters given are Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and it's flat. Oh right, the scale factor is a=1, so we're looking at the present time, I think.

Comoving distance is the distance between two points measured along a path that is comoving with the expansion of the universe. It's the distance that would be measured if space weren't expanding. So calculating comoving distance depends on the redshift of the object and the integral of 1/(Hubble parameter) over redshift.

But wait, how do I find the redshift from the given data? The peak is at 790 nm. I think quasars emit light that can be redshifted, so perhaps the peak we observe is the rest frame peak shifted. If the rest frame peak is in the optical or near infrared, maybe. For example, if the rest frame peak is at a certain wavelength, and we see it at 790 nm, then the redshift z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength - 1.

Wait, what's the rest wavelength for a quasar's emission line? I'm not sure. Quasars emit strongly in optical, UV, etc. Maybe the peak is from some emission line. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is in the UV at about 121 nm. But if that's the case, and we observe it at 790 nm, then z would be (790 / 121) - 1 ≈ 6.52. Hmm, that's a high redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is in the near-infrared.
