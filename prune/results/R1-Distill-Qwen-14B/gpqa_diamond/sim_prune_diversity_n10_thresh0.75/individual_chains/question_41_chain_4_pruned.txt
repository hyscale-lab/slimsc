Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes, right? The index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in glass would be c/n, but wait, c is given as 1 in the problem. So the speed in glass at rest would be 1/n.

But wait, the glass isn't stationary here. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh, right, this involves the motion of the medium relative to the observer. So I need to think about how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light. I'm a bit fuzzy on this part.

I remember something about the Doppler effect and how it relates to light, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Or wait, maybe it's more about the addition of velocities in special relativity? But wait, when we're dealing with light, things are different because light always moves at c in a vacuum. But the medium here is moving, so does that change anything?

Wait, no. Because in special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. So no matter how fast the source or medium is moving, the speed of light measured in any inertial frame should still be c. But wait, that's in vacuum. What if the medium is moving? How does that affect the speed of light in that medium, as observed?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about it in terms of Galilean transformations first, but Galilean doesn't apply at high speeds. Alternatively, think about the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in this problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving at speed v_light relative to the glass, and the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. What is the observed speed of the light in the lab frame?

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is c/n in its rest frame. But since the glass is moving, we need to find the lab frame speed.

But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light is moving at c/n within the glass. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of light in the glass, but that's only in the
