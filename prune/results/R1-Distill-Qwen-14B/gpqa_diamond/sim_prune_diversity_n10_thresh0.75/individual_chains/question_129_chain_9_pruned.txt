Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me read the problem carefully. The reaction steps are:

Compound A → reacts with HCN → produces compound B.

Compound B → reduced with H2 and Pd → forms compound C.

Compound C → reacts with HNO2 → forms compound D.

Compound D → elimination of inert gas → forms compound E.

And there are some hints provided. Let's look at the hints.

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, phosphorous ylide reactions are usually for Wittig reactions. So the ylide would react with a carbonyl group to form an alkene. So if compound A is reacting with a ylide to form that product, then A must have a carbonyl group, right?

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the same as isopropenyl, I think. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2, both methyl groups. And at position 4, there's an isopropenyl group attached.

So the starting compound A must have a carbonyl group that, when attacked by the ylide, forms that cyclopentane structure. Because in Wittig reactions, the ylide's R groups add to the carbonyl to form a new double bond.

Wait, maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let me sketch this out. Suppose A is cyclopentanone with some substituents. When a Wittig reagent (ylide) adds, it would form an alkene.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at 1,2, and 4 positions. Let me imagine the structure. Positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups, position 4 has an isopropenyl group.

So, perhaps the carbonyl in compound A is in a position that, when the Wittig reaction occurs, it forms the double bond at the 4 position. The Wittig would replace the carbonyl oxygen with a double bond between carbons adjacent to the oxygen.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl was at position 4, and the Wittig added a substituent leading to the double bond there.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound A is a cyclopentanone with substituents. Let me think about the structure.

Another approach: The product after Wittig reaction is a cyclopentane with substituents. So the starting material (A) must have a carbonyl group, perhaps cyclopentanone itself, but with substituents.

Wait, but in the product, the isopropenyl group is at position 4. So maybe the Wittig reagent had an isopropenyl group. Oh wait, the Wittig reagent is an ylide derived from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. So if the reagent's R groups are such that when they attack the carbonyl, they form the isopropenyl group.

Wait, but the product has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is (CH2CH(CH3))—. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the Wittig reagent must have been something like CH2CH2P... No, wait. The general structure of a Wittig ylide is R2P=CH-R', where R' is the part that will add to the carbonyl.

So, for the product to have
