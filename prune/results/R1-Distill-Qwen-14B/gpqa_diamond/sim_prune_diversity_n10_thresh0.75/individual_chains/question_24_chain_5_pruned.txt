Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it carefully.

The question involves mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. I'll try to break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance can undergo an addition reaction with bromine. So, these could be alkenes or alkynes because they have double bonds that react with Br2. Also, it says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, maybe each component is a single double bond, not conjugated, perhaps like ethylene or something.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, wait, so maybe each component in X undergoes a reaction? Or perhaps X consists of a single substance that's a mixture but that seems unlikely. Hmm, wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, which after reaction form two different products. But then, the reaction is a disproportionation, which is a redox reaction where a species is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps each component in X is a diene or something that can undergo some kind of split.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, which when treated with Pt and heated, undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which is another equimolar mixture. So, maybe each component in X undergoes a disproportionation. Or perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, and each undergoes a different reaction. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, after hydrogenation (with Pt under severe conditions) of both X and Y, only one substance Z is obtained. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. Mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of Z). So, if Z is CxHy, then mass of H is (y * 1)/(12x + y) ) = 14.28% or 0.1428.

So, (y)/(12x + y) = 0.1428. Let me solve for x and y. Let's see, 14.28% is roughly 1/7, since 1/7 is approximately 14.2857%. So, 0.1428 ≈ 1/7. So,

y/(12x + y) = 1/7 → 7y = 12x + y → 6y =12x → y =2x.

So, the hydrocarbon Z has the formula CxH2x. So, possible candidates are ethylene (C2H4), but wait that's a gas. Or maybe larger alkenes? Or perhaps it's a cyclic compound like cyclopropane (C3H6), but that's a gas too. Wait, but if Z is a constituent of Y, which
