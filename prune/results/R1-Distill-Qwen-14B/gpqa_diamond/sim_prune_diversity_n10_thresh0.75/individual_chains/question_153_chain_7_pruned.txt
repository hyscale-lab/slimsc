Okay, so I've got this problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Hmm, I remember that malonate esters are good nucleophiles in the Michael reaction. They have the enolate form which attacks the beta position of another carbonyl compound.

So, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which I think is something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl) with the ester group. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? Or wait, the formula would be CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO2Me? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the substituent on the middle carbon being p-tolyl. No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, no, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But in this case, the 3-position would be where the p-tolyl is attached.

Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think again. The general structure for methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate group as CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon. So maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2 with substituents. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally.

Ah, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the middle carbon (the CH2=CH-C- part). Oh, wait, no, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? No, that doesn't fit the nomenclature. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester,
