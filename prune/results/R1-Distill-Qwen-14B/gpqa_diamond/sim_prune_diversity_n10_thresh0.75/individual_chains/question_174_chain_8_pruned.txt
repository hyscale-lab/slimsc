Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think through it step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated classically.

Hmm, so first I need to figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. And this sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M. Oh wait, wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. Wait, no, let me recalculate that. 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the light fragment is 0.33 M, the heavy one is 0.66 M. That makes sense because 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus has mass M, but after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99 M. So there's some mass deficit, which would be converted into kinetic energy and maybe other forms like binding energy or radiation, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so perhaps we can assume that the rest mass loss is converted into kinetic energy.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities as v1 (heavier fragment) and v2 (lighter fragment). But since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but wait, actually, the more massive one would have a lower speed. Let's get into the details.

But wait, I'm getting confused between relativ
