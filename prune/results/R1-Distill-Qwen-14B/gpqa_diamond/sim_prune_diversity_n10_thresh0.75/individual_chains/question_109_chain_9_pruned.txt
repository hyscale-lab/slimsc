Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's see what it says. We've got a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, and they emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what that equation means. Oh right, the Pauli exclusion principle applies here because the nucleons are fermions. So their total state (including spin, orbital angular momentum, and isospin) must be antisymmetric. The condition given here relates the isospin T to the sum of spin S, orbital angular momentum L, and adds 1, then takes mod 2. So T must equal S + L + 1 mod 2. 

The question states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T = 0. Let me plug that into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must add up to an odd number. That means one is even and the other is odd. So either S is odd and L even, or S even and L odd.

Now, the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted when the two nucleons emit this particle X. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state to a final state plus a particle. The particle X is denoted by p, f, s, etc., which I think correspond to different orbital angular momenta. Wait, no, the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. Like, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, I think.

So the initial state is 1S0. Let me break that down. The initial state is (2S+1)LJ, so 1S0 is (2*0 +1)S (so L=0) and J=0. So the initial total angular momentum J is 0.

When they emit particle X, the final state of the NN system is some state, and the emitted particle has its own angular momentum. So the process must conserve angular momentum and parity.

Angular momentum conservation: The total angular momentum before and after must be the same. The initial state has J=0, so the total after emission (NN state and X) must also have J=0. But wait, when you emit a particle, you have to consider the orbital angular momentum between the two systems. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the reaction's angular momentum.

Wait, the initial state is the NN system with J=0. Then, they emit X, so the final state is the NN system plus X. But the problem says the final NN state has certain quantum numbers, so maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is
