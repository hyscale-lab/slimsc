Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm. I've got three genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockout mutants and some double mutants. The resistance levels are given, and we need to figure out the gene interactions.

Wait, what's the setup again? Oh right, each gene's knockout has a certain resistance level. The wild type is at 100%, so a lower percentage means the plant is more susceptible, right? So the higher the percentage, the more resistant.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → more resistant than wild type? Wait, no, wait. Hmm. Wait, the question says the resistance is a percentage of the control. So if the control is 100% resistant, a plant with 75% is 75% as resistant as the wild type. So that would mean it's less resistant, more susceptible. Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. No, I think if the resistance is 75%, it's 75% as resistant as the wild type. So the plant is 25% less resistant. So more susceptible than wild type.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose because they cannot produce certain gene products?" So if the mutants have lower resistance than wild type, they are more sensitive.

So looking at the numbers:

g1: 75% → 75% as resistant as control. So 25% less. More susceptible than wild type.

g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So the mutant can't resist the pathogen at all.

g3: 50% → half as resistant as control.

Double mutants:

g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2, but what's the interaction here?

g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. Now, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of them is a TF, which would mean it's regulating the others.

We need to figure out the relationships between these genes. Possible options include whether they act in a linear pathway, if one is upstream of another, or if they function redundantly.

Let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutation is observed only when gene A is non-functional.

In terms of pathways, if you have a pathway where gene A acts upstream of gene B, then a mutation in A (which is earlier) would have a more severe phenotype than a mutation in B. Because if A isn't working, then B isn't getting the signal to do its job either.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of a genetic pathway. Suppose gene G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. Then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. Hmm, but that's if G2 is the TF for both.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is upstream of G1, which is upstream of G3. Or any other combination.

Looking at the double mutants:

When g1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%. When g2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%. When g3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%. 

So the g2 mutant is the most susceptible. So perhaps G2 is the most critical gene in the pathway.

In the double mutants, when you have g1g2, the resistance is 0%. So same as g2. That suggests that the g2 mutation is epistatic to g1. Because even when g1 is knocked out, the presence of the g2 knockout brings it down to 0% resistance. So, the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the more severe single mutant, which would imply that G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So, not as bad as the g2 mutants, but worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Hmm.

Wait, let's make a table to organize the data.

Single mutants:
g1 → 75% (more than wild type, but less than control?) Wait no, wait. The control is 100%, so 75% is 75% as resistant as the control. So more susceptible than the wild type. So g1 is less resistant than wild type.

g2 → 0%. So much more susceptible.

g3 → 50% → more susceptible than wild type.

Double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% → same as g2.

g1g3 → 10% → worse than g1 (75%) and worse than g3 (50%).

g2g3 → 0% → same as g2.

Hmm.

So when you have a double mutant, what determines the phenotype? If two genes are in a pathway, the double mutant phenotype is the same as the more severe single mutant, then the two genes are in the same pathway. Or if the double is worse than either single, they might be in parallel pathways.

Wait, but for the g1g2 double, it's 0% like g2. So it's as if the presence of g2 knockout determines the phenotype. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at g2g3: 0% same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is not working, then even if G1 or G3 is working, it doesn't matter because their function can't be activated. So in the double mutant, when G2 is knocked out, the other gene's function doesn't contribute, so the phenotype is the same as G2 alone.

Now, what about the g1g3 double mutant? It's 10% resistance. So that's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining both knockouts makes the phenotype more severe than either single, but not as severe as the g2 mutants.

Which suggests that G1 and G3 are in a parallel pathway. Because when both are knocked out, the effect is additive (or synergistic), leading to a more severe phenotype than either single.

Alternatively, maybe they are in the same pathway, but not downstream of G2.

Wait, but G2 is upstream of both, so g2 is epistatic. So when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' knockouts don't matter because their products aren't used.

So if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then when G2 is working, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So in the wild type, G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed; if both are knocked out, resistance is lower than when either is alone.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is working, and you knock out G1, you lose some resistance (from 75% to 100%?), no. Wait, in the single mutants:

Wild type is 100% resistance.

g1 is 75% → so resistance is lower than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance. So G1 normally contributes to resistance. Similarly, G3 knockout reduces resistance to 50%, so G3 contributes. G2 knockout leads to 0%, so G2 is essential.

So G2 is the most important, and its knockout completely negates resistance.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% → same as g2. So again, G2 is epistatic to G1.

g2g3 → 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

g1g3 → 10% resistance. Which is worse than either single (75% and 50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than any single knockout, but not as bad as the G2 knockout.

So this suggests that G1 and G3 are in a parallel pathway downstream of G2. Because when G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive.

So in terms of the possible options, which of the choices fit this scenario?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but G2 is epistatic towards G1, which fits. But it's said that G1 is a transcription factor. But our analysis suggests that G2 is the transcription factor because G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

So option A is probably not correct.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter? That doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps if they are co-regulated. But the double mutant g1g3 is more severe than each single, suggesting they are in parallel, not that G3 is epistatic over G1. So not sure about this option.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that a single gene affects multiple traits. But the question says that at least one is a TF. If G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, then knocking out both would have an additive effect, but I'm not sure that fits the data. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then a double mutant would have the same as G1 mutant. But in our data, the double is worse than either, so perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1? Not sure. Or maybe not.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits the data: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So that suggests redundancy; both genes contribute to the same pathway, so knocking out both has a more severe effect.

Also, G2 being the transcription factor makes sense because G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

So in terms of epistasis, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So in any double mutant involving G2, the phenotype is 0%, same as G2.

So looking back, the options:

Option D says G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the data shows that when G1 and G3 are both KO, the phenotype is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, so knocking out both adds to the effect. But redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. Wait, but redundancy would mean that if one is working, the other doesn't matter. So if both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Wait, no: if two genes are redundant, then knocking out one doesn't change the phenotype (if the other is functional). But knocking out both would cause a more severe phenotype. So that seems to fit the data. Because for example, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50% resistance. Both are worse than wild type, but the double is worse than either, which would suggest that each gene contributes to the same function, so redundancy.

So, G1 and G3 are redundant. But what about the epistatic part? Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype is 10%. So if G1 is epistatic, which one's mutation would mask the other? Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, in the double mutant, the phenotype is more severe than either single. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps.

Alternatively, another way: since G2 is a TF, it activates G1 and G3. When G2 is working, both G1 and G3 are expressed. If G2 is knocked out, neither is expressed (since G1 and G3 are under G2's regulation). So in the case of g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but in this case, G2 is functional. So G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So when you have the double mutant without G2, their functions are additive.

Wait, but in the g1g3 double, why is the resistance only 10%? Because G1 and G3 may each contribute some level of resistance, but when both are knocked out, their combined absence makes the resistance even lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway. For example, G1 activates G3. Then, knocking out G1 would prevent G3 from being expressed. But in this case, the data for g3 is 50%, so knocking out G3 alone causes a bigger effect than G1. So that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: determining which gene is upstream. Since the g2 mutant is 0%, which is the most severe, G2 is the key gene. So G2 is likely the transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3.

So G2 is a TF; G1 and G3 are downstream. Now, looking at the double mutants:

In g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So, worse than either single.

But without G2, the resistance is 0% regardless of other mutations.

So, in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 can't function, so their knockouts don't matter.

In the presence of G2, the function of G1 and G3 can contribute to resistance. So when both are knocked out, resistance is reduced beyond what either single knockout shows. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, each contributing some level of resistance, but when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

So, G1 and G3 are redundant. That would explain why the double mutant has 10% resistance. So each of them contributes some level, but when both are gone, the resistance is lower.

So looking at the options, option D says G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their order in the pathway doesn't matter. So epistatic relationships might not apply between them. Because if they are redundant, the order wouldn't matter. So perhaps that part is incorrect in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in a linear pathway, but that doesn't fit the data as well.

Wait, let's think about epistasis: if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as G1. But in the g1g3 case, it's 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G3 is epistatic to G1. Hmm, no, because if G3 is epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same as G3. But G3 is 50%, and the double is 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps neither is epistatic, but they're additive.

Hmm. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, meaning that each can contribute to the same function. So knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype, which fits the data. So when G2 is working, G1 and G3 each contribute some resistance. If you lose both, resistance is lower.

So looking back at the options:

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but redundancy doesn't necessarily imply an epistatic relationship. So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect.

Alternatively, option C says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 affects multiple traits, or perhaps G3 is involved in multiple pathways. But that's not directly supported by the data. The data suggests that G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, and when both are knocked out, their combined effect is worse than either alone, which suggests redundancy.

So option D seems better because it mentions gene redundancy, which fits the data.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Therefore, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone.

Which option matches this? Option D says, "G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3."

Wait, but in the data, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, so their functions are additive. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, not redundant.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either single. So that fits the g1g3 data. So the g1g3 mutant has a worse phenotype than either g1 or g3, which suggests they are redundant.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, upstream of G1 and G3, which are redundant.

Looking at the options, which one says that.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the epistatic part doesn't fit with the data. Because if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant would have the same as G1, but the data shows 10%, worse than G1's 75%.

So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect in option D.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic statement.

Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a G1 mutation masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would look like G1.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. So the presence of a G3 mutation would determine the phenotype of the double mutant. But in this case, G3's single is 50%, and the double is 10%, so that's worse. So maybe that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway where G3 is downstream of G1. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed. But in the data, G3's single is 50% resistance, whereas G1's single is 75% resistance. So knocking out G3 has a bigger effect. So that would suggest that G3 is downstream of G1, because without G1, G3 can't be expressed. But then, the G3 single mutant would have a similar effect as the G1G3 double. But in the data, the G1G3 double is 10%, which is worse than either.

Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

In a linear pathway, say G2 → G1 → G3. So G2 is TF, activates G1, which then activates G3.

If G2 is knocked out, then G1 and G3 can't be expressed → resistance is 0%.

G1 knockout: G3 is not expressed → resistance is 75% (because G3 contributes to resistance but without G1, G3 isn't expressed). Wait, but in the data, G1's single is 75%, which is higher than G3's 50%. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are both downstream, but in parallel. So G2 activates both G1 and G3. Each contributes to resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance (but G3 is still active). Knocking out G3 reduces resistance but G1 is active. Knocking out both makes resistance much lower.

So in this model, G1 and G3 are redundant, each contributing to the same function. So their presence is additive.

So in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, so that fits.

In this scenario, G2 is the transcription factor. G1 and G3 are redundant.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So that fits.

Now, the second part of option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but in our model, they are redundant, so their order doesn't matter. So maybe the epistasis part is not correct, but perhaps the option is the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis part is a distraction, and the key points are the transcription factor and the redundancy.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant. So looking at the options, option D says that.

So the answer should be option D.


To analyze the gene interactions in white lupine resistance to anthracnose, we examine the resistance levels of single and double mutants to infer the relationships between G1, G2, and G3. The resistance levels are as follows:

- **g1**: 75% resistance (more susceptible than wild type, 100%)
- **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible)
- **g3**: 50% resistance (more susceptible than wild type)
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant)
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2)
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2)

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is the most critical gene**: The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating G2 is essential for resistance. Additionally, any double mutant involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also has 0% resistance, showing that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

2. **G1 and G3 are downstream of G2**: Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, G2 likely acts upstream of G1 and G3. This means G2's function is necessary for G1 and G3 to contribute to resistance.

3. **G1 and G3 are redundant**: The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway and their functions are additive when both are knocked out. This is consistent with gene redundancy, where both genes contribute similarly to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is a transcription factor, but the data suggests G2 is the transcription factor (upstream of G1 and G3). Additionally, G2 is epistatic to G1, not the other way around.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported. Furthermore, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is a transcription factor, pleiotropy is not supported by the data. The interaction between G1 and G3 is better explained by redundancy, not pleiotropy. Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 are redundant. The double mutant g1g3 having 10% resistance, worse than either single mutant, aligns with redundancy. However, the statement that "G1 is epistatic towards G3" is not fully supported, as the double mutant phenotype is worse than either single mutant, suggesting additive effects rather than epistasis.

### Conclusion:
The best-supported conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant. While the epistasis claim in Option D is not fully consistent with the data, it is the most accurate overall.

Answer: D
