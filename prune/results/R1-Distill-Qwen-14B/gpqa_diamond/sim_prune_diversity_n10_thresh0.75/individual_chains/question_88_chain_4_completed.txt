Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Let me try to break this down.

The setup is that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cells' variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is happening here.

Hmm. So I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where antigens are sampled. When an antigen like a rotavirus protein is taken up, it's processed and presented to immune cells, like B cells, which then get activated.

The variable heavy chain gene variability suggests that the B cells are diversifying their antibodies. But when does that happen?

Somatic hypermutation comes to mind. I think that's the process where B cells diversify their antibodies after the initial antigen encounter, especially during the germinal center reactions. This process increases the diversity of the antibodies produced by each B cell, which is essential for a stronger immune response.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This happens after the B cells have been activated and are in the germinal centers. They mutate their variable regions, leading to more diverse antibodies. The high variability in the variable heavy chain would fit here.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, especially in the classical pathway. It's about activating the complement system, which leads to lysis of pathogens. Not directly related to antibody variability in this context.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability of the antigen-binding site. So the variable regions wouldn't change much here, only the class.

D) VDJ recombination: That's during the generation of the initial diversity in the immune system, happening in the bone marrow for B cells. The V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged during B cell development. But that's before the immune response is mounted, and in this question, the B cells are already activated and proliferating, so this process is done.

In the scenario, the GFP-tagged proteins are delivered to Peyer patches, which are likely capturing the antigens. The B cells there would take up the antigen, present it, and then undergo activation. Once activated, they go through somatic hypermutation in the germinal centers, leading to diverse variable regions. The sequencing showing high variability supports this.

So the process must be somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is observed in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population isolated from these patches suggests a process that diversifies antibodies.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells diversify their antibodies by mutating the variable regions of their heavy chain genes. This explains the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, making it the most likely process.
- **B) Complement activation**: This involves the complement system attacking pathogens but does not directly relate to the variability in antibody genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the antigen-binding site's variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in the immune system. However, it is not relevant here since the B cells are already activated and proliferating.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes aligns with the process of somatic hypermutation, which occurs after antigen activation and leads to diverse antibody production. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
