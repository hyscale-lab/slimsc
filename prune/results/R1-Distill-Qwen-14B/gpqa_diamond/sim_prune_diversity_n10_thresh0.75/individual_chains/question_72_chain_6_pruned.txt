Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from a compound and ending up with product 4. We need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4.

Let me break down each step of the reaction sequence to understand what's happening. 

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think that's a norbornene structure with a tert-butoxy group attached. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, right? So the structure has two rings fused together.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. So, the starting material is reacting with another dienophile perhaps? Or maybe undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction? Let me think.

Wait, the compound 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dienophile groups. Each of the dibromomethyl groups is attached to the cyclohexene ring. And sodium iodide is present, which is often used in elimination reactions, maybe as a base.

So, the starting norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) has two double bonds. Wait, no, norbornene has one double bond, I think. So in the starting material, there's one double bond in the bicyclo structure. 

Wait, perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene (norbornene) is reacting with a dienophile. But each dienophile is a dibromomethyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. Wait, maybe the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is acting as a dienophile? Or maybe the norbornene is opening up?

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a cycloaddition. But norbornene is a conjugated diene, so perhaps it's reacting with another diene or dien
