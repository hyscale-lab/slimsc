Okay, so I've got this physics problem here from the CERN Bubble Chamber, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is calculated as E/(m c²), but in particle physics, energies are often given in units where c² is accounted for, so maybe I can just use E/m.

Wait, the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The energy here is 27 GeV, which I think is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait no, wait. In particle physics, when they talk about the energy, is it the total energy (rest mass + kinetic) or just the kinetic? Hmm, I think in this context, when they say the energy is 27 GeV, that's the total energy of the X⁰ particle.

So, the Lorentz factor γ is E / m, so 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that. 27 / 3.41 is approximately... let's see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8=27.28. Oh, so 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So about 7.92. So γ is approximately 7.92.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s = let's calculate that. 7.92 * 8 is 63.36, so 63.36e-16 seconds. Which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, wait, no. 8e-16 * 7.92 is 63.36e-16, which is 6.336e-15 s.

But why do I need the lifetime? Oh, right. Because the decay length depends on the velocity of the particle and how long it lives in the lab frame.

The decay length L is v * τ. But I need to find the velocity. Alternatively, another approach is to compute the decay length as L = c * τ * β, where β is v/c. Because v = β c.

Wait, another approach: βγ is a common term. Since γ = 7.92, and β = v/c, and we
