Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are more complex, like cat states. Non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is, so the higher the value, the more non-Gaussian it is.

The problem gives me the state |psi> as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) divided by N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which they give as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha squared)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the given state and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (del_b) is calculated by comparing the given state (which is non-Gaussian) to a reference Gaussian state. So, the idea is that if the state is Gaussian, del_b would be zero, and non-zero otherwise.

But what's the reference Gaussian state here? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state. Oh wait, sometimes the reference is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state or something else.
