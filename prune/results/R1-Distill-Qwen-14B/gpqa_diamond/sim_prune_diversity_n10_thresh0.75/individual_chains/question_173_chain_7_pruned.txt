Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction with a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. They're asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. The options are from 1e-18 J up to 1e-16 J.

Wait, I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least h-bar over 2. Or was it h/(2π)? So, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), maybe? Or is it h/(2π)? I think it's the latter. So Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π) because the uncertainty principle is often written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). So yeah, the minimum uncertainty happens when it's equal to ħ/2.

So, first I need to find Δp. Because once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. Hmm, but wait, how does the uncertainty in energy come into play here?

Oh, right! Because of the time-energy uncertainty principle. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's not that. Let me think. Another approach: The energy of a particle is related to its momentum. For a free particle, the energy is kinetic, so E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Because E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be approximately (since ΔE is the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp) 2p/(2m) * Δp = (p/m) Δp. But wait, maybe I should use a more precise approach here.

Alternatively, using differentials: dE = (d(p²/(2m))) = (p/m) dp. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, so to find ΔE,
