Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to get product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. Finally, I'm supposed to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are A to D.

Alright, let's break it down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) heated to 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

I remember that when dihalides react with KOH, especially when heated, elimination reactions can occur. But wait, KOH in such conditions might lead to dehydrohalogenation, producing alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromo would give something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So, maybe the reaction is elimination followed by some sort of cyclization, or perhaps it's a substitution that forms a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with base, they usually undergo elimination to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal; it's across carbons. So would that elimination form a diene or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but in such a way that forms a carbonyl. For example, if two bromides are removed as HBr, and perhaps the structure rearranges. Wait, but if the starting material is 1,3-dibrom
