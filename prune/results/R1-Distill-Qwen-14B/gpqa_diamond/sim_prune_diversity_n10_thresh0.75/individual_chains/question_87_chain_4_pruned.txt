Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone or an ester or something) and an aromatic-halogen bond, so like a halogen attached to the ring, like Cl or Br.

So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? Because it's a six-membered aromatic ring, which is benzene. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. And the total carbons are 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Because 6 (benzene) + 2 = 8.

Wait, but substituents can be more than one carbon each. Oh, but di-substituted means two substituents, each can have multiple carbons. So, for example, maybe a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, benzene has six carbons. The substituents should add up to two more carbons to make 8. So each substituent is probably one carbon. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero (but that can't be, because it's di-substituted). Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl group attached to the ring as a substituent) and another substituent is a halogen (like Cl or Br). But wait, a carbonyl group like a ketone is attached as a substituent, which would be a carbonyl connected to the ring. So that's one substituent (the carbonyl is a part of the substituent, like a methyl ketone or something else? Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that's only one substituent. Hmm, maybe it's more than that.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total, so benzene has 6. The substituents add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon? No, wait, if it's two substituents, maybe each is one
