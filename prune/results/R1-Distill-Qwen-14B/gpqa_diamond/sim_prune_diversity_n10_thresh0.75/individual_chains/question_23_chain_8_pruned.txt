Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked the reaction using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was proceeding. Two new spots appeared, indicating two products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction. Also, since the compound has an ether linkage (oxy), maybe the reaction is about the double bond in the substituent.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw the structure. So the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but wait, butenyl is four carbons. The numbering is 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So the substituent is at position 1, so structure is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, but for butenyl, the positions are 1, 2, 3,4. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. No, wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-Ph? No, wait, but the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is:

The substituent is O connected to a CH2 group. Then, another CH group, which is attached to two methyl groups (since it's 2,2-dimethyl). Then another CH2, and then a CH2 group, but wait, no.

Wait
