Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So, I need to figure out how much PO4^3- is present in the solution.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Wait, I remember that these two salts are related. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. But wait, when you have both, they might form a buffer solution. Because when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer. In this case, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps. The relevant Ka values are Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. The problem gives them as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1, the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2, and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3.

But wait, in this solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4 is 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the main species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. These two can interconvert based on the Ka2 value because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which means I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, but in the solution, I don't see much PO4^3- because the third dissociation (from HPO4^2- to PO4^3-) is very small, as Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is really tiny. So perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is very low, and I might need to calculate it using the Ka3 value.

Wait, but the initial salts don't provide PO4^3-. Only through dissociation of HPO4^2- can we get PO4^3-. So, to get the concentration of PO4^3-, I need to find how
