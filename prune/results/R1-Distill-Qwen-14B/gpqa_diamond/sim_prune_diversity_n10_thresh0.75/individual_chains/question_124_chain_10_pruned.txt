Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime is gamma times longer. So, the particles will travel further before decaying because their lifetime is extended.

The problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the inner walls. So I guess when gamma is higher, more particles would reach the walls because they live longer and can travel further.

Wait, so the radius is 30 meters. So the distance the particle needs to travel to reach the detector's inner wall is 30 meters. The particles are moving at a speed close to the speed of light, which is about 3e8 meters per second.

But wait, because they're moving ultra-relativistically, their speed is approximately c, so we can approximate their velocity as c. So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall would be distance divided by speed. So t = 30 m / c.

But the particles have a proper lifetime tau (tau_0). So in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma * tau_0. So if the time t is less than gamma * tau_0, then the particle can reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before.

So the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than the time t. But wait, in reality, I think it's more about the decay process. The decay is a Poisson process, so the probability that the particle hasn't decay
