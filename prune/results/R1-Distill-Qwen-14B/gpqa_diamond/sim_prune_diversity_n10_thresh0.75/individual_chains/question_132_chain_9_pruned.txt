Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their NMR spectrum. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, which probably means each compound has a benzene ring with some substituents.

Wait, the mixture is 1:1, so each compound contributes equally. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating to 1:1 ratio. And then there are three singlets at about 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let me think about what these signals could mean.

The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) usually has multiple peaks depending on the substitution pattern. For a monosubstituted benzene, there's typically one peak for the protons adjacent to the substituent. But if there are multiple substituents, the splitting can get more complicated. Wait, the problem says two singlets, each singlet in the aromatic region. That suggests that each aromatic compound has equivalent protons that are not split, perhaps because of symmetry.

Wait, but each compound would contribute their own set of aromatic protons. So the two singlets in the aromatic region would come from each compound. Each compound has a certain number of equivalent aromatic protons. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options, all the compounds except for 1,4-diethylbenzene are tetramethylbenzenes. The diethylbenzene might have a different substitution pattern.

Let me consider the structure of each option. For example, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzeneâ€”also known as 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is like four methyl groups in a row around the ring. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so 1,2,3,4 being adjacent would mean four methyl groups on consecutive carbons? Or wait, maybe it's a para arrangement? No, 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent in a row, making it a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. But that's actually not possible because a benzene ring can't have four substituents in a row without some being meta or para.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. For benzene rings, when substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4, that would place them on four consecutive carbons. So, that would look like a ring with four methyl groups in a row. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1,2,3,4 are four in a row, leaving positions 5 and 6 empty.

Wait, but such a substitution pattern would create certain symmetry. For example, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the molecule is actually symmetric along a plane that bisects the ring between positions 5 and 6. So, maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Let me imagine the structure: positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. Then, the protons on positions 5
