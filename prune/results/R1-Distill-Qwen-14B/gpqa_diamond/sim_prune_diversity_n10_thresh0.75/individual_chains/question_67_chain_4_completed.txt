Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1 and l2 of 1.

The problem gives the coupled angular momentum state as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought that when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So for l1=1 and l2=1, the possible total l's are 2, 1, 0. Oh wait, but the given state has l=2. So that's the maximum possible, which makes sense because when both are aligned, their sum is 2.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l is 2, and m is -1. I'm wondering about the possible m1 and m2 values that contribute to this state. Because the total m is m1 + m2, right? So here, m is -1, which equals m1 + m2.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum has m values of -1, 0, +1. So the possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to -1 are: (-1,0), (0,-1). Are there others? Let's see: what if m1 is 1 and m2 is -2? Oh wait, no, because m can't be less than -1 for an electron in l=1. So the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

But wait, the coupled state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 states that add up to a particular m. So when we have |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>, it's a linear combination of all |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible |m1, m2> are (-1,0) and (0,-1), right?

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a superposition of those two states. But wait, what's the coefficient in front of each? For maximum total l, the state is given by |l=2, m> = |m1 + m2>, so the state would be a combination where the maximum addition is achieved. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form, but I think when l = l1 + l2, the state is just |l1, m1> |l2, m2> with m1 + m2 = m, and the coefficients are 1? Or maybe it's more involved.

Wait, I recall that for two angular momenta coupling, the state |l1, l2, L, M> can be written as a sum of |l1, m1>|l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M. But for the case when L = l1 + l2, the state is just |m1 = M - m2, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for L = l1 + l2, the state is simply the product state where each is in m = (L/2) or something. Hmm, perhaps it's when L=2, which is l1 + l2, so the state is just |l1=1, m1=1> and |l2=1, m2=1> when L=2 and m=2. But in our case, m is -1, so it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For L = l1 + l2, the state |l1, l2, L, M> is |m1 = M, m2 = 0>, but only when M is up to l1 + l2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, each multiplied by some coefficients. But what are the coefficients? For the L=2 case, the state when M=-1 would be a combination of those two.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 = l2 =1. So for the state with L=2 and M=-1, what's the expansion? Let me think. The expansion for |1,1,2,M> is a sum over m1 and m2 with m1 + m2 = M, of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients times |m1>|m2>. The coefficients are such that for L=2 and M=2, it's |1,1>, for M=1, it's a combination of |1,0> and |0,1>, etc.

Wait, let me think of the possible m's when L=2. For M=2: only m1=1, m2=1. So the state is |1,1>.
For M=1: m1=1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=1. So the state is sqrt(1/2) [|1,0> + |0,1>].
For M=0: m1=1, m2=-1; m1=0, m2=0; m1=-1, m2=1. So the state is a combination of these, each with some coefficients.
Similarly, for M=-1: m1= -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1. So the state is sqrt(1/2) [ |-1,0> + |0,-1> ].
And for M=-2: m1=-1, m2=-1. So state is | -1, -1 >.

Wait, that makes sense. So for M=-1, the state is 1/sqrt(2) (| -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ). So the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) each.

Now, the problem is asking for the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and L2z for the second. The possible eigenvalues for each are -ħ, 0, +ħ. So the question is, what's the probability that both are measured as -ħ.

But wait, in the given state, which is |1,1,2,-1>, we need to write this state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. From our earlier discussion, the state is (| -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) / sqrt(2).

So the possible terms are | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >. Each of these has m1 and m2 values. So in the first term, m1 is -1 and m2 is 0. In the second term, m1 is 0 and m2 is -1.

Wait, but the problem asks for the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So we're looking for the case where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z eigenvalues are m1 * ħ, so for m1=-1, L1z is -ħ. Similarly for m2=-1.

But in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a combination of | -1, 0 > and | 0, -1 >, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because the possible terms are m1=-1, m2=0; or m1=0, m2=-1. So there's no component where m1=-1 and m2=-1.

So when you make a measurement of both L1z and L2z, the possibilities are either m1=-1, m2=0 or m1=0, m2=-1. But the question is about the joint probability that both are -1.

Since in the state, there are no terms where both are -1, the probability is zero. So the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l = 2 \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m = -1 \) is the corresponding \( z \)-component of the total angular momentum.

The state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the \( z \)-components of the orbital angular momentum for the first and second electrons, respectively. Specifically, for \( M = -1 \) in the coupled state, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients give the expansion:

\[
|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |-1, 0\rangle + |0, -1\rangle \right).
\]

This means the state is a superposition of two terms: \( |-1, 0\rangle \) (where \( m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0 \)) and \( |0, -1\rangle \) (where \( m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1 \)). There is no component in this state where both \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \). Since \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) correspond to \( m_1 \hbar \) and \( m_2 \hbar \), respectively, measuring both as \( -\hbar \) requires \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \). However, as shown above, there is no such term in the given state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \). Therefore, the probability of this outcome is zero.
