Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is like a norbornene structure. So the substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at the 7 position. Norbornene has two rings, right? So the molecule looks kind of like a bridge structure with an oxygen substituent.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Wait, sodium iodide with dibromide... Oh, this must be a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so maybe an elimination or substitution is happening here.

Wait, the starting cyclohexadiene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. When sodium iodide is present, maybe it's a double elimination. The dibromide leaving groups could be replaced by something else.

Wait, wait, the starting molecule is a bicyclic diene. So maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps a coupling reaction. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the reagents. 2 equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source. Oh! Maybe it's a ring-opening or a substitution where the diene is acting as a dienophile.

Wait, another thought: when you have dienes and dienophiles, Diels-Alder is a possibility. But in this case, the diene is the same in both reactants. Alternatively, perhaps the 7-(tert-butoxy) norbornene is acting as a diene, and the other molecule is the dienophile.

Wait, the dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene has two Br groups on adjacent carbons. So when it reacts, maybe the Br leaves, and the structure becomes more conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the dibromide in some way.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder-like reaction, but with substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis? No, that might not fit with the reagents.

Wait, another approach: the norbornene has a substituent, and the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition? Or perhaps it's a cycloaddition.

Wait, but the number of equivalents is two, and the problem says '2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene' so maybe each diene reacts with one equivalent of the norbornene or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a coupling reaction where the norbornene's double bonds react with the dienophile. Or perhaps the norbornene is a diene and the other molecule is a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing some kind of substitution. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? I don't think so. Wait, but the norbornene has a bicyclic structure with a bridge, so perhaps the reaction is adding something to the bridge.

Wait, when I don't know, perhaps I should think about the next steps. After forming product 1, it's treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to form product 4.

So, what reactions are these?

Treated with aqueous H2SO4: maybe acid-catalyzed ring-opening or some kind of dienophile addition.

Then, SO3 and pyridine in DMSO usually is a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine acts as a base. DMSO might be a polar aprotic solvent. So perhaps product 3 is a sulfonated version of product 2.

Heating product 3 at 150C likely leads to some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

But perhaps I should try to figure out each step's outcome.

Starting with the first reaction: combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Wait, sodium iodide in a polar aprotic solvent? Or maybe in some other solvent. Alternatively, in a substitution reaction, the dibromomethyl groups could be replaced by something else.

Wait, if the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, perhaps it's undergoing a substitution where the Br is replaced. But with two equivalents, maybe each diene molecule is reacting twice.

Wait, maybe the norbornene is acting as a diene, reacting with two equivalents of the dienophile. But what's the dienophile here?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a [4+4] cycloaddition? Or maybe a ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening via the dienophile. The norbornene has two double bonds? Or one conjugated diene? Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which has a bridge and one double bond. So the starting material is a norbornadiene? Wait, no, the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Oh, so it has two double bonds: at positions 2 and 5. So it's a conjugated diene within the bicyclic system.

So, the norbornadiene has two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. Then, the dienophile would have a double bond that's electron-deficient.

Wait, in the first step, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. With two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group.

Wait, but that's a lot of substitution. Alternatively, maybe each of those positions has a CH2Br group. Wait, the formula is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each of those carbons has two Br atoms attached. So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene is CH2Br2?

Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. So each of the 5 and 6 positions on the cyclohexadiene has a CH2Br2 substituent.

So, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the norbornadiene and the cyclohexadiene dienophile. But wait, the dienophile usually has a good electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. Here, the dienophile is a diene with two CH2Br2 groups. Hmm, not sure if that's a good dienophile.

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of norbornene via the dienophile. So, the norbornene's double bond could react with the dienophile in a cycloaddition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, and the norbornene is undergoing an alkylation. Since there are two equivalents, maybe each end of the diene reacts once.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the dienophile. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene by the dienophile. When norbornene is treated with a dienophile like maleic anhydride, it can form a new six-membered ring. But in this case, the dienophile is a cyclohexadiene with Br groups.

Wait, maybe the Br is a leaving group, so the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a group from the norbornene. But I'm not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the dienophile in a [4+4] cycloaddition to form a larger ring, but I'm not familiar with that reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene and the cyclohexadiene. Let me think about the structure.

Norbornene is a bicyclic structure with a double bond. The cyclohexadiene is a six-membered ring with conjugated double bonds and two CH2Br2 groups.

Hmm, maybe it's a [4Ï€] electrocyclic ring-opening of the norbornene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the norbornene to the dienophile. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the norbornene's substituent (tert-butoxy) is the nucleophile. But the tert-butoxy group is a poor nucleophile, being bulky and a good leaving group when protonated.

Wait, perhaps the NaI is providing iodide ions as nucleophiles. So the CH2Br2 groups in the dienophile might undergo substitution. But that would require a good leaving group, which Br is, but in an SN2 reaction, the structure would need to be suitable.

Wait, the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups on adjacent carbons (positions 5 and 6). So each CH2Br2 is a good leaving group. When treated with NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by I. But why would that be? That's substitution.

Wait, but the problem is that the dienophile is reacting with the norbornene. So maybe the norbornene is acting as a base, abstracting a proton and then the Br leaves. Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is opening up.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the next steps.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to form product 2. So, maybe the first step forms a diene structure that is then protonated or undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is a sulfonating agent, and pyridine would absorb the H+ generated.

Then, product 3 is heated, which might eliminate something, like water, leading to a ring formation or an aromatic compound.

So, putting it all together: the first reaction probably forms a ring structure, perhaps a fused ring. Then, under acidic conditions, it might undergo ring expansion or other changes. Then, sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, and heating causes some rearrangement, maybe forming an aromatic compound.

Wait, the final product after heating might be a naphthalene derivative? Because heating sulfonated compounds can sometimes lead to aromatization.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fused bicyclic system with a sulfonic acid group.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to map out each step.

Step 1: Reaction of norbornene derivative with two equivalents of the dienophile and NaI.

Norbornene is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene.

The dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the 5 and 6 positions has CH2Br2.

Hmm, perhaps each of those CH2Br2 groups is being replaced by a group from the norbornene.

Wait, but the norbornene has a bridge. Maybe the dienophile is undergoing two alkylation steps.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene's double bonds can attack the dienophile's double bonds.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dienophile has two double bonds and can undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with the norbornene's diene. But [4+4] cycloadditions are less common and typically require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is reacting in a conjugate addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction, and the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. Wait, but the norbornene has a conjugated diene, which is more likely to be a diene than a dienophile.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the norbornadiene and the cyclohexadiene dienophile. But wait, that would require the norbornene to act as a dienophile and the other as a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the two dienes are undergoing some kind of coupling reaction. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the first step being a ring-opening of the norbornene.

Norbornene can undergo ring-opening under certain conditions, like with a strong acid or base. The substituent (tert-butoxy) is a bulky group, which could influence the ring-opening.

If the norbornene ring opens, perhaps the dienophile is adding across the resulting double bond. Alternatively, maybe the ring-opening leads to a diradical or some intermediate that reacts with the dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is acting as a nucleophile. Wait, with two equivalents, each of the dienophile molecules could add to the norbornene.

Wait, perhaps each of the two CH2Br2 groups in the dienophile is being replaced by a bridge from the norbornene. So, the norbornene's bridge would connect to each of the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups.

Wait, but how would that happen? If the Br leaves, then the CH2 group would have a positive charge, which could be attacked by a nucleophile. But the norbornene's structure is more of a bridge, so maybe it's a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is adding across the norbornene's double bond, leading to a larger ring structure.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the overall structure of the final product and work backward.

The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So, the final structure likely has several equivalent and nonequivalent H's.

If the final product is a sulfonated aromatic compound, perhaps the sulfonic acid groups are in positions that create symmetry.

Wait, when you sulfonate a benzene ring, the sulfonic acid group is a strong meta-directing group. So, if the initial product after sulfonation has a benzene ring with substituents, the sulfonic acid would be in a particular position.

But perhaps the product after heating is a naphthalene derivative. Naphthalene has two fused benzene rings, and the substituents would affect the symmetry.

Alternatively, if the product is a polycyclic structure with sulfonic acid groups, the symmetry could reduce the number of unique H's.

Wait, but how many unique H's are in naphthalene? Well, naphthalene has 10 H's, but some are equivalent. The H's on the periphery are all equivalent in certain positions. Wait, actually, in naphthalene, there are two sets of equivalent H's: the ones on the alpha positions and the beta positions. So, if there's a substituent on one alpha position, the symmetry could be broken.

But considering all this, perhaps the final product is a naphthalene derivative with a sulfonic acid group. Let's say the sulfonic acid is at position 1, and the molecule has some symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the steps again.

Step 1: Reaction forms product 1.

Product 1 â†’ treated with H2SO4 â†’ product 2.

Product 2 â†’ treated with SO3 and pyridine â†’ product 3.

Product 3 â†’ heated â†’ product 4.

So, after the first step, product 1 might be a ring-expanded structure or a bridged compound. Then, acid treatment could protonate something, leading to a ring opening or addition.

The second step, sulfonation, would add a sulfonic acid group. Then, heating could lead to loss of water or other groups, forming rings.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction of norbornene with the dienophile could form a larger ring, maybe a 10-membered ring or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile undergoes substitution at both CH2Br2 groups, replacing Br with something from the norbornene.

Wait, the starting dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups. If each Br is replaced by a bridge from the norbornene, perhaps leading to a larger bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by a group from the norbornene, leading to a molecule with two new bridges.

Wait, but norbornene has a bridge already. If each dienophile's Br is replaced with the bridge, maybe the structure becomes more complex.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the first step is a ring-opening of the dienophile. The dienophile is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br2 groups. When it reacts with the norbornene and NaI, perhaps the Br is replaced by something else.

Wait, since NaI is present, it's a good source of I- ions. So, perhaps the dienophile's Br is replaced by I, but why would that happen? Or perhaps, in a substitution, the Br leaves, and the I- comes in.

Wait, but if the dienophile has two CH2Br2 groups, each substitution would require two equivalents of NaI. Since there are two equivalents, each dienophile molecule would substitute both Br's for I's. Then, the dienophile becomes 5,6-bis(diiodomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But then, how does this react with the norbornene?

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the norbornene's oxygen is a leaving group, but it's a tert-butoxy, which is not a good leaving group unless protonated.

Wait, under acidic conditions, the tert-butoxy group could become a good leaving group (as t-butanol is not a strong enough base to deprotonate easily). So maybe in the first step, under the reaction conditions (maybe with heat and NaI), the tert-butoxy group is replaced by something else.

Wait, but NaI is a source of I-, so perhaps the tert-butoxy group is replaced by iodine. But why would that happen? If the norbornene's oxygen is a leaving group, perhaps it's replaced by I from NaI.

So, product 1 would be 7-iodobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, when treated with H2SO4, perhaps nothing happens. Wait, but the next step involves sulfonation, which requires an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction isn't substitution but a Diels-Alder reaction, resulting in a new six-membered ring. So, norbornene (the diene) reacts with the dienophile (cyclohexadiene with Br groups) in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a new bicyclic structure.

Wait, but the dienophile's structure is a diene, which usually isn't a good dienophile. Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile (like a carbonyl group). So perhaps the dienophile in this case is not a good one, making the Diels-Alder less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile's Br groups are leaving groups, and the reaction is a coupling where the norbornene's double bonds form new bonds with the dienophile's carbons.

Wait, perhaps the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups are leaving, and the carbons become carbo-cations, which the norbornene's double bonds could attack.

So, perhaps the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups are replaced by the norbornene's bridge. So, two equivalents of dienophile would each lose a Br and gain a bridge from norbornene.

Wait, that would form a new structure where the norbornene is connected to each of the two dienophile's CH2Br2 positions, replacing Br with the norbornene's bridge.

Wait, but norbornene has two double bonds. Maybe each dienophile reacts with one double bond of norbornene.

Alternatively, perhaps each dienophile reacts with the norbornene, leading to a new structure where the norbornene is attached to two positions of the cyclohexadiene.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the overall process.

I'm trying to find the number of distinct H's in product 4. So, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a high degree of symmetry, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Wait, if product 4 is a naphthalene derivative with some substituents, the number of H's could be 8, 4, 10, or 7, as per the options.

Naphthalene itself has 10 H's, but some are equivalent. If the sulfonic acid groups are in symmetrical positions, the number of unique H's could be reduced.

Alternatively, if the final product is a fused ring system with a sulfonic acid group, perhaps the number of unique H's would be 8.

Wait, another possibility: the final product is a decalin system, which is a naphthalene-like structure. Decalin has two six-membered rings fused together, and depending on the substituents, the symmetry could lead to fewer unique H's.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe the final product is a biphenyl structure with sulfonic acid groups, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclic system with a sulfonic acid group, leading to a certain number of unique H's.

Wait, perhaps I should outline the possible structures at each step.

Step 1: Reaction of norbornene with dienophile.

Assume that the norbornene's diene reacts with the dienophile's dienophile, leading to a new bicyclic structure. Or perhaps it's a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the dienophile's CH2Br2 groups are replaced by the norbornene's substituent, leading to a bridged structure.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. Maybe I should look for the answer based on the possible structures.

The options are 8,4,10,7. If the final product has a structure like naphthalene with some substituents, perhaps 8 H's. But if it's a more symmetric structure, like a decalin, maybe fewer.

Wait, another angle: the initial reaction forms a new ring. Then, acid treatment might cause it to undergo ring expansion. Sulfonation adds a group, and heating causes aromatization.

If the final product is a naphthalene ring with a sulfonic acid group, perhaps the sulfonic acid is in a position that makes the molecule symmetric. For example, if the sulfonic acid is para to another group, the number of H's could be reduced.

Wait, naphthalene has 10 H's, but if there are substituents, some H's become unique. For example, if there's a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4, the symmetry is broken, and more unique H's arise.

Alternatively, if the sulfonic acid is at position 1 and the naphthalene is symmetric, maybe the number of unique H's would be 8.

Wait, naphthalene has 10 H's, but some are equivalent. In the parent naphthalene, there are two sets of equivalent H's: the alpha (positions 1 and 8) and the beta (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7). Wait, no, actually, the structure is more symmetric. Let me recall: in naphthalene, the positions are:

Positions 1 and 8: equivalent (alpha positions)
Positions 2 and 7: equivalent (beta positions)
Positions 3 and 6: equivalent
Positions 4 and 5: equivalent

Wait, no, actually, the numbering is such that positions 1 and 8 are equivalent, 2 and 7 are equivalent, 3 and 6 are equivalent, 4 and 5 are equivalent. So, each pair is equivalent, leading to four sets of H's in total. But each set has two H's.

Wait, but in that case, naphthalene has 4 sets of equivalent H's. So, 4 distinct types, but 10 H's in total.

Wait, but if the naphthalene has a substituent, like a sulfonic acid group, the symmetry is broken. For example, if the substituent is at position 1, the H's at position 2 and 7 are no longer equivalent because one is adjacent to the substituent and the other is not.

So, the number of chemically distinct H's would increase.

Wait, but in the question, the final product might have a sulfonic acid group and perhaps another substituent from the initial structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully aromatic compound with multiple substituents, leading to 8 distinct H's.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully symmetric molecule with 8 distinct H's.

Another angle: the starting material is a norbornene, which is a bicyclic structure. After reactions, perhaps it forms a larger ring, like a decalin system, which upon sulfonation and heating becomes a naphthalene derivative.

If the product 4 is a naphthalene derivative with a sulfonic acid group and some substituents, maybe the number of H's would be 8.

Alternatively, perhaps product 4 is a fully aromatic compound with multiple substituents, leading to 8 distinct H's.

But I'm not entirely certain. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Wait, another way to think: the initial norbornene has a bridge, which upon reaction and sulfonation, might form a naphthalene-like structure with a sulfonic acid group attached. If the sulfonic acid is in a position that creates a plane of symmetry, the number of H's could be fewer.

Wait, if the sulfonic acid is in position 1, and the molecule has another substituent symmetrically placed, like in position 5, then the molecule could have mirror symmetry, reducing the number of unique H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a five-membered ring, leading to a different count.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a decalin system, which is a bicyclic structure. Decalin has two six-membered rings. If the sulfonic acid is in a certain position, the number of unique H's would be fewer.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the possible answers. The options are 8,4,10,7.

If the final product is a naphthalene with a sulfonic acid group and some substituents, perhaps the number is 8.

Wait, another thought: the final product after heating could be a fused bicyclic system with a sulfonic acid group, leading to 8 unique H's.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure, which after reactions becomes a tricyclic system, perhaps with a sulfonic acid group, leading to 8 H's.

But honestly, I'm not sure. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the process.

Considering that the starting material has a bicyclo[2.2.1] system, and after several reactions, it's likely transformed into a more aromatic structure. Sulfonation would add a strong group, and heating could lead to ring formation or loss of substituents.

If the final structure is a naphthalene derivative with a sulfonic acid group, the number of unique H's could be 8.

So, I'll go with option A)8.


The problem involves determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (product 4) of a multi-step reaction sequence. Here's the analysis:

1. **Initial Reaction (Step 1):**  
   The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This likely involves substitution or cycloaddition reactions, where the tert-butoxy group or the norbornene's double bonds interact with the dienophile. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the result is product 1, which is likely a bicyclic or fused ring structure.

2. **Acid Treatment (Step 2):**  
   Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions may protonate functional groups or facilitate ring-opening or rearrangement, leading to product 2. This step could set the stage for further functionalization.

3. **Sulfonation (Step 3):**  
   Product 2 is treated with SOâ‚ƒ and pyridine in DMSO. This is a classic sulfonation reaction where a sulfonic acid group is introduced. The sulfonic acid group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and typically directs further substitution or affects the symmetry of the molecule.

4. **Heating (Step 4):**  
   Product 3 is heated at 150Â°C, likely leading to aromatization or elimination, forming product 4. The final product is likely a polycyclic aromatic compound, possibly a naphthalene derivative with a sulfonic acid group.

5. **Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**  
   The final product is hypothesized to be a naphthalene derivative with a sulfonic acid group. Naphthalene itself has 10 hydrogen atoms, but the sulfonic acid group disrupts symmetry, increasing the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Based on the options provided, the most plausible number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 is **8**.

Answer: A
