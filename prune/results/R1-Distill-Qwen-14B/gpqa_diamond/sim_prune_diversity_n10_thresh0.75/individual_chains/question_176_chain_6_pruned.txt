Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that seems a bit off because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their components squared and summed should equal 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. Oh, so that's 6, which is way more than 1. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe these components are normalized. Or perhaps I need to normalize the state vector before proceeding. Right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized. So I should probably normalize it first.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. I'll note that and proceed.

Next, we have two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as 3x3 matrices.

Operator P's matrix: first row (0, 1/√2, 0), second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row (0, 1/√2, 0).

Operator Q's matrix: first row (1, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the order is: measure P, then measure Q. So the probability we're looking for is P=0 and Q=-1.

But wait, I think the way measurements work is that after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured value. Then, when measuring Q, the state is in that eigenstate of P, so the probability of getting Q=-1 would be calculated based on that new state.

So first step: find the eigenstates of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Because when we measure P and get 0, the system collapses into that eigenstate.

Wait, but how do I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P? Let me try that.

So
