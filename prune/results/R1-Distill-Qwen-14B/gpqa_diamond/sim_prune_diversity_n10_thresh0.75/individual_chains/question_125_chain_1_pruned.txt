Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. Hmm. It says the system is a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic 3D potential V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what the "third excited state" means. So, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n=0 maybe? Or is it n=1? Wait, no, for the 3D harmonic oscillator, each state is characterized by quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial quantum number and the angular parts.

Wait, no, in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated using the concept of vibrational states. The energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. I remember that the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta. Wait, no, wait. Or is it E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω? Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so total would be sum of each plus 3/2.

But another way to look at it is that the energy levels are E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So N is the total number of quanta in all three directions.

So the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then N=0, so E = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would have N=1. So the possible N values are 0,1,2,... each corresponding to higher energy levels.

Wait, but what's the third excited state? Let's think. The ground state is N=0, which is the first state. Then first excited is N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. So the third excited state has N=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, no. Wait, the energy formula is E = (N + 3/2) ħω. So for N=3, E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy part.

Now, how many eigenfunctions correspond to the same energy eigenvalue? That is, how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy as the third excited state (N=3).

Wait, when N is fixed, the number of eigenfunctions for that energy is the number of ways to write N = n_x + n_y + n_z, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. So for N=3, the number of possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. That's a combinatorics problem.

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N + 2 choose 2). So for N=3, it's (3 + 2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions. Oh, but wait, each of these corresponds to different spatial orientations, so each has a different eigenfunction, but same energy. So the number is 10.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Now looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. Option C has the same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which doesn't match. Option B and D have different energies, so they can be eliminated.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the ground state. Ground state is N=
