Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is benzene. Let's see what each step does.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that HNO3 is a nitrating agent, and H2SO4 is the catalyst. So benzene undergoing nitration. Nitration typically adds a nitro group. Where does it go? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can go in any position, but it's a meta-directing group. Wait, no, when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is usually added in the meta position relative to where? Wait, no, wait. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which has a nitro group attached. Since benzene is symmetric, the product is just a single structureâ€”nitrobenzene has the nitro group para to itself? No, wait, nitro group is a strong meta director. Wait, no, when benzene is nitrated, the major product is nitrobenzene, which is actually a mono-substituted benzene with the nitro group in one position. But since it's the first substitution, the nitro group can be anywhere, but the molecule is symmetric, so it's just nitrobenzene.

Wait, wait, actually, nitration of benzene occurs once, giving nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Alternatively, if another reaction occurs, but no, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene as the main product.

Second step: Product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and Fe. Oh, that's a bromination. So in the presence of Fe as a catalyst (like in electrophilic substitution), bromine adds to the ring. Since nitro is a meta director, the bromine should enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group. So nitro group is at position 1, bromine would be at position 3. So product 2 is m-bromo-nitrobenzene, or 3-nitro-1-bromobenzene? Wait, numbering: if the nitro is at position
