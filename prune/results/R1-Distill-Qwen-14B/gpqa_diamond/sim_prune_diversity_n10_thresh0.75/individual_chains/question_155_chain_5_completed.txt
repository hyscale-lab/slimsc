Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in a particular eigenstate of P_x.

First, let me recall what I know. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, for P_z, the uncertainty ΔP_z would be sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But wait, the explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's the state vector ψ.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, I don't need to change the basis or anything like that. The state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That makes things a bit easier because the expectation values can be calculated directly.

So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But wait, for expectation values, I remember that ⟨A⟩ for an operator A is ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

But wait, let's think about the P_z matrix. The matrix for P_z is given as:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

The state vector ψ is a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that as a row vector (the conjugate transpose, which is just the transpose since the components are real here) as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

So, let's compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Breaking it down:

Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, and then summed.

So, the first term is (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ

Second term is (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) → that's zero.

Third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (1/4) (- ħ) because (-1/2)*(-ħ) is (ħ/2), but then multiplied by (-1/2) again? Wait, no. Wait, the third element is (0,0,-ħ). So the third entry in P_z is -ħ. So ψ's third component is -1/2. So the product for the third term is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → let's compute:

(-1/2) * (-ħ) is (ħ/2), then multiplied by the same component (-1/2), so (ħ/2) * (-1/2) → -ħ/4.

So adding all three terms: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) → 0.

Wait, that can't be right. The sum is zero? So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? Hmm.

But wait, that might be correct. Let me double-check. Let me write the calculation again.

Each term in the expectation value is a component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, multiplied by the component of ψ. So:

First term: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) → (1/4) ħ.

Second term: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) → 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) → let's see: (-1/2) * (-ħ) is (ħ/2), then multiplied by (-1/2) again, which gives -(ħ/2)(1/2) = -ħ/4.

So total is (1/4 ħ) + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. Yes, that's right.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. Then the expectation of P_z squared is ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared, right? Because P_z is diagonal. So P_z² will have elements (ħ², 0, ħ²), wait no. Wait, the diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So when you square them, you get (ħ)^2, 0, and (ħ)^2, because (-ħ)^2 is ħ².

So the matrix P_z² is:

[ ħ²  0    0 ]
[  0   0    0 ]
[  0   0  ħ² ]

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the squares of the components multiplied by the diagonal elements.

So, compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, each term is (component)^2 multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

First component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) * ħ².

Second component: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4)* ħ².

Adding them up: (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) → sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2). So that would be the answer. But let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated P_z squared, the diagonal elements are (ħ^2, 0, ħ^2), right? Because [P_z]^2 is a diagonal matrix with (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So yes, each non-zero element is ħ squared. So when I compute the expectation value, the first and third terms are (1/4) * ħ^2 each, adding to 1/2 ħ². So yes, ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

And since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, the variance is (1/2) ħ², so the standard deviation is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, but let me just make sure that the state is correctly given. The state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Are these normalized? Let me check normalization.

The sum of squares of the components is (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = (1/2) + 1/2 = 1. So it's normalized, which is correct.

So I think I did everything correctly. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector of the system is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi.
\]

Breaking this into components:

- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- Second term: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi.
\]

Breaking this into components:

- First term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- Second term: $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- Third term: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
