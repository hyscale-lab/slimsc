Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let's see what the potential looks like.

The potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's interesting. So it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance and θ is the angular coordinate.

Wait, I think potentials that depend on r and θ can sometimes be broken down into radial and angular parts. Like, maybe this can be expressed in terms of r² and some angular function. Let me try to rewrite V(r, θ).

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out the kr² term. So V = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, maybe I can separate this into radial and angular components. The radial part is kr², and the angular part is 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ. Wait, but in terms of quantum mechanics, potentials that depend on θ often lead to angular momentum considerations, but wait, this potential depends on cos²θ, which might relate to the angular part of the wavefunction.

Wait, but in the case of central potentials (which depend only on r), the separation is straightforward, but here the potential depends on θ as well. So maybe it's not a central potential. Hmm, but perhaps I can still separate the problem into radial and angular parts using polar coordinates.

Wait, the general approach for solving the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates would be to separate the variables. So the wavefunction would be a product of a radial part and an angular part. The radial equation would then depend on the potential, and the angular equation would depend on the angular part of the potential.

So let me write the potential as V(r, θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ). Wait, but in our case, the potential has terms with r² and cos²θ. So V_r(r) would be the part that depends only on r, and V_θ(θ) the part
