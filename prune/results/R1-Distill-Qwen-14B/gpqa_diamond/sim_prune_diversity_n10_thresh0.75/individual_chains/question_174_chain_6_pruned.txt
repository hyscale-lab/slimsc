Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments have rest-masses where one is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, wait. So, the key here is that we're comparing relativistic and non-relativistic calculations for the kinetic energy. The problem is asking for the difference between the two, so I probably need to compute T1 both ways and subtract.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV. So, M c² = 300 GeV.
- After fission: two fragments. Let their rest masses be m1 and m2. One is twice the other. So, m1 = 2 m2.
- The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 is 2 m2, substituting gives 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M / 3 ≈ 0.33 M. Then m1 is about 0.66 M. 

But wait, the initial rest mass was 300 GeV. So, M c² = 300 GeV. So, the rest masses of the fragments are m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV, and m2 c² = 99 GeV. Hmm, but wait, wait. Because the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so their rest masses sum to 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So, m1 is 2/3 of that, which is 198 GeV, m2 is 99 GeV. So that's correct.

Now, when the nucleus splits, energy is released. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero (conservation of momentum), so they move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

In the rest frame, the initial energy is all rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies of the fragments. So, energy conservation:

Total initial energy = total final energy.

So,

M c² = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2)

Because the kinetic energy
