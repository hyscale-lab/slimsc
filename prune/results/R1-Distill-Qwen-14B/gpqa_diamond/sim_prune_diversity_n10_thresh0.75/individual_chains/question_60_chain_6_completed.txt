Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? So, it's a question involving special relativity. I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, meaning that time moves slower for the traveler relative to a stationary observer.

The problem says there's an astronaut from an alien civilization who is 22 years old. They're traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light to Earth. The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are about whether they'll die before getting there or the time it takes.

Wait, but wait. The astronaut's perspective... So, from their frame of reference, they're not moving, but Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are moving. But wait, no, the spacecraft is moving at that speed relative to Earth. So, the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is important here. Oh, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I need to figure it out with the given information.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy, so the distance is quite large. But I'm not sure about the exact distance. Wait, perhaps I can compute the time from Earth's frame and then use time dilation to get the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but the problem states the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Oh, so the astronaut is 22, so they have about 128 years left, more or less. So, if the trip takes longer than that from their perspective, they might not survive. So, the options are whether the time is longer than that, or shorter.

But let me think again. Let's get the distance. I think the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years from Earth. Wait, but in this problem, it's the other way around. The aliens are coming from the LMC to Earth. So, we can assume the distance is about 160,000 light-years. Maybe 1.6e5 light-years.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance. So perhaps that's a missing piece. Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the fact that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, so really close to the speed of light. So the proper time experienced by the astronaut (the time they feel) is much shorter than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, yeah, the time experienced by the astronaut would be less due to time dilation. So the formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, wait. In special relativity, the time experienced by the moving clock (the astronaut) is the proper time, which is shorter than the coordinate time (Earth's frame) time. So, the formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame.

So, I need to find the time from Earth's perspective first. The time is distance divided by speed. So t = distance / v.

But the problem is, I don't have the distance. Hmm. Wait, the problem says the aliens are in the LMC and are going to Earth. So the distance between them and Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Hmm, but I'm not exactly certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the speed given and a distance that's implied by the time it would take at c.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the time from Earth's frame as t = distance / v. But without the distance, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the time based on the distance being 1.6e5 light-years, which is roughly the distance to the LMC.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The speed is given as 0.99999987c. Let me compute gamma, the Lorentz factor, because that's going to be important for the time dilation.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. Let me compute v = 0.99999987 * c.

So v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute (v/c)²: (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-6 approximately. So (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-6) + (1.3e-6)^2 ≈ 0.9999986. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - (0.9999986) = 0.0000014. Wait, no, wait: 1 - (v²/c²) is 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - approx 0.99999974, which is 2.6e-6. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-6.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-6) ≈ 0.001612. So gamma is 1 / 0.001612 ≈ 620. So the Lorentz factor gamma is about 620.

So, if t is the time in Earth's frame, then the proper time t' (the astronaut's time) is t / gamma.

Wait, or wait: the proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, so t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So, let's compute t. The time from Earth's frame is distance divided by speed. Let's compute that.

Assuming the distance is D = 160,000 light-years. Speed v = 0.99999987c. So time t = D / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) * [c is ly/year, since light travels 1 ly per year]. So the c in denominator cancels ly. So, t = (160,000) / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ approximately 160,000 years plus a tiny fraction. So about 160,000 years from Earth's perspective.

So t' = t / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 620 ≈ approx 258 years.

Wait, but the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes about 258 years from their perspective, they would die before reaching Earth. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So according to their frame, they are 22, and they would age about 258 years during the trip. So 22 + 258 = 280, but their average lifetime is 150. So 258 is way more than 150. So they would die before reaching Earth.

So the answer is A: The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Because 160,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c is about 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. So t is about 160,000 years. Then t' is 160,000 / 620 ≈ 258 years.

Wait, wait, but why gamma is 620? Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

Compute (v/c) = 0.99999987.

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute this more precisely.

Let me write 0.99999987 as (1 - 1.23e-6). Because 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.23e-6.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a², where a=1.23e-6. So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.23e-6) = 1 - 2.46e-6. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.46e-6.

So sqrt(2.46e-6) is sqrt(2.46)*1e-3. sqrt(2.46) is about 1.568. So 1.568e-3. So gamma is 1 / 1.568e-3 ≈ 637 approx. So perhaps gamma is about 637, not 620 as I thought earlier.

So t' = t / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 637 ≈ 251.3 years.

Still, 251 years is way more than the astronaut's 150-year expected lifetime. So the astronaut would not survive the trip.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine whether the astronaut will survive the trip, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity. The astronaut is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. At such speeds, time dilation occurs, meaning the astronaut's experienced time (proper time, \( t' \)) is shorter than the time observed from Earth's frame (\( t \)).

The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D \approx 160,000 \) light-years. The time \( t \) from Earth's perspective is calculated as:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

For \( v = 0.99999987c \), \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.99999974 \), so \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-6} \). Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 0.001612, \quad \text{so } \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.001612} \approx 620.
\]

The proper time \( t' \) experienced by the astronaut is related to \( t \) by:

\[
t' = \frac{t}{\gamma}.
\]

Substituting \( t \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 620 \):

\[
t' \approx \frac{160,000}{620} \approx 258 \, \text{years}.
\]

The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifetime of 150 years. Since the trip takes approximately 258 years from their perspective, they would not survive the journey.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
