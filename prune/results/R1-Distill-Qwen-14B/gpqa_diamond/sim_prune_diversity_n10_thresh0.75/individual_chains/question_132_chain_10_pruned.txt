Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The problem is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two signals at around 6.7 ppm, both singlets, and they're in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at about 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm. Let me start by recalling what NMR signals tell us. The aromatic region (around 6.5-7.5 ppm) indicates the presence of protons attached to the aromatic ring. The fact that there are two singlets here suggests that the aromatic protons in each compound are equivalent, or perhaps each compound has a certain symmetry that makes all their aromatic protons equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, but since it's a mixture of two compounds, each contributing their own set of signals. So for the aromatic region, each compound should have a certain number of equivalent protons, each giving a singlet. But the problem says two signals, meaning two different sets of equivalent protons. Also, the integration is 1:1, so each of these two signals has the same area, implying that each compound contributes equally to the aromatic protons.

Wait, but each compound has a certain number of aromatic protons. Let me think about the structures.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Let's see, for benzene rings with substituents. Benzene is C6H6. So each substituent here is likely a methyl group because each methyl is CH3. Let me calculate the number of substituents.

C10H14: Benzene is 6 C, so 10-6=4 substituents. Each substituent is a methyl (CH3) group. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, wait. Wait, 4 substituents would mean four methyl groups, right? Let me see: each methyl is CH3, so for four methyl groups, that's 4*3=12 H. Benzene has 6 H. So total H would be 6 + 12 = 18? But the formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps some substituents are more than one group.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would contribute 4 C and 8 H. Because 6 (benzene) + 4 (substituents C) = 10. H: 6 (benzene) + substituent H. Each substituent is a methyl (-CH3), which contributes 3 H. So four substituents would contribute 4*3=12 H. 6+12=18 H, but the formula is C10H14. That's a problem
