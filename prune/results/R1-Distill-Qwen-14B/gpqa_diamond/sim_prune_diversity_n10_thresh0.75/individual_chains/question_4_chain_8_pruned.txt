Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate just one. That must have something to do with Maxwell's equations. Let me think.

Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to charges and currents. There are four of them. Let me try to recall each one.

The first equation is about the divergence of the electric field. It relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. So that's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. I don't think this one is affected by having isolated magnetic poles because that's more about electric charges. So maybe this equation stays the same.

The second equation is about the curl of the electric field. It says that the curl of E equals the negative time derivative of the magnetic field, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But wait, when there are changing magnetic fields, this equation produces circulating electric fields, like in induction. If you have isolated magnetic poles, maybe this equation changes? Or does it relate to another equation?

The third equation is the divergence of the magnetic field. In our universe, it's zero because there are no isolated magnetic poles. So ∇·B = 0. But in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, meaning that the divergence of B might not be zero anymore. So this equation would change. So this equation (the divergence of B) would be different.

The fourth equation is about the curl of the magnetic field. It says ∇×B equals μ₀ J plus something with the displacement current, ∂E/∂t. So ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). I'm not sure if this would change. Wait, the curl of B relates to current plus the displacement current. Isolated poles might not affect this equation directly because current is about moving charges, not isolated magnetic poles. Or wait, maybe if you have isolated poles, you could have magnetic charges, like monopoles. So would that change the equation?

Wait, in our universe, B is generated by currents (moving charges) and displacement currents. If magnetic monopoles exist, then perhaps the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Also, the sources of B would include magnetic charges as well as the usual currents.

Wait, let me think again about Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles exist, then there would be a magnetic charge density ρ_m. Then, the divergence of B would be proportional to ρ_m. So equation 3 would change.

What about the curl of B? In our case, ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). But if you have magnetic monopoles, does that affect the curl equation? Wait, I think the curl equation would stay the same because it's about how B and E fields relate, and the sources for B are currents and displacement currents. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I'm recalling that when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations are modified. The divergence of B is related to the magnetic charge density. Also,
