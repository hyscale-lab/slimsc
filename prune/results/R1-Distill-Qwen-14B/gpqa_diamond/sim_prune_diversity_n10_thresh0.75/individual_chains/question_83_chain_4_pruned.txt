Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's read the question again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, first things first. Let me outline what I know.

Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid, and when titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it forms the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻Na+ + H2O.

So, the first step is to find the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because we've diluted 20 cm³ of acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume × concentration. Let's calculate that. The original volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.020 L. So moles = 0.020 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by total volume. The total volume is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So, 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when we start titrating, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So the equivalence point will be when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate.

But let's first find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are 0.025 L × 0.025 mol/L? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, no—no, wait, earlier I found the moles are 0.001 mol. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, times 0.05 is 0.001. So for the equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed would be same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait,
