Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question says.

The problem is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But since there are three solutions here, I need to figure out the net acid or base after mixing. Oh wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl is a strong acid. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters). Let's break them down.

For CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't donate as many H+ ions as a strong acid.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl-.

Ba(OH)2: The formula is Ba(OH)2, so each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So the concentration is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. But since each gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix these solutions, the total volume changes. Let me calculate the total volume. 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

Now, let's think about the reactions. Strong acid and strong base will neutralize each other first. So HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will react. The reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, let's see how much H+ and OH- we have.

From HCl: 0.08 moles H+ (since it's a strong acid, all dissociates).
From Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles OH-.

So when they react, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the moles of H+ after reaction would be:

H+_initial = 0.08
OH- = 0.18

After reaction: OH- is more, so H+ will be zero, and excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait
