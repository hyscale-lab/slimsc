Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But maybe that's not super relevant here. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses, and I need to find how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1. All have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I think the formula for equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D^2)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is distance, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, since all planets have the same albedo, maybe that cancels out.

But wait, the problem gives us temperature ratios between the planets. The ratio of Planet1 to Planet2's equilibrium temperatures is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 it's 2.3. So let's write that down:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → T2 = T1 / 1.4
T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3 = T1/(1.4 * 2.3)

Wait, no, let me think again. If T1/T2 is 1.4, then T1 = 1.4 T2. So T2 = T1 / 1.4.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3. So substituting T2 from above, T3 = (T1/(1.4)) / 2.3 = T1/(1.4 * 2.3) = T1/(3.22). So T3 is about 0.31 times T1.

Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse. Because equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Oh
