Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns. I need to determine what the chemist observes in each case.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is the process where an alkene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So, the first step for each reaction is the epoxidation of the respective alkenes.

So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Both go to completion, so we get the epoxides.

Wait, but wait. When alkenes react with mCPBA, the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Let me think about that. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation would lead to a trans epoxide? Or maybe the opposite? Or perhaps the same as the starting material?

Wait, no, I think it's that the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration. So, for a trans- (E) alkene, the epoxide forms with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Hmm, maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, I could think that the epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, and the configuration of the double bond affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the addition of mCPBA to an alkene results in the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So, for an E-alkene, the epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, and for a Z-alkene, they would be on the same side. So, for Reaction 1, we get (E)-epoxide, and for Reaction 2, (Z)-epoxide.

Wait, but no, when mCPBA adds across a double bond, it's a peracid acting as an electrophilic oxidizing agent. The reaction is a concerted process where the peracid adds across the
