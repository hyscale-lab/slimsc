Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to its energy uncertainty. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time (which relates to the lifetime here) is at least h-bar over 2π or something like that. Wait, yeah, the uncertainty principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2π, where Δt is the lifetime of the state, I think.

So each state has a certain energy uncertainty based on its lifetime. To distinguish two states, their energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that, their peaks would overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

Let me calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. The formula is ΔE = ħ / (2πΔt), I think. Wait, but sometimes people use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt because the 2π is a constant factor. But I'm not sure if I should include it or not. Maybe for the sake of this problem, it's better to use the approximation without the 2π. Or perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact formula.

Wait, Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.05457e-34 J·s. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is ħ divided by twice the lifetime.

But wait, no, the uncertainty is ħ/(2πΔt) when using the exact formula. Alternatively, sometimes the relation is written as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The correct Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π). So ΔE is approximately ħ/(2πΔt) when the uncertainty is at minimum.

So for each state, E1 has Δt1 = 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2π * Δt1). Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2
