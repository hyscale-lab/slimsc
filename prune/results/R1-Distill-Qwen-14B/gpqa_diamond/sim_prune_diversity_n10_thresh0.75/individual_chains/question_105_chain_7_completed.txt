Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it carefully and think through how to solve it. Hmm... Alright, so the question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes over time, much like the transit of an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that could cause the same brightness variation as these spots?

Wait, so if the star wasn't spotted, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits? Right, because the spots cause a dip in brightness each time they pass in front of us as the star rotates. But the observed variation is due to the spots, and we want to find the planet size that would mimic that variation.

I remember that the change in brightness, or the amplitude of the light curve, depends on the area of the star that's blocked. So when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is ΔF ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, in this case, it's not exactly the same because the spots are spread over a hemisphere.

So the spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Wait, but one hemisphere is covered, so the area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the star's hemisphere. Wait, no. Let me think again. The filling factor is 20%, which means 20% of the hemisphere is covered in spots. So the total area covered is 0.2 * (π R² / 2), since each hemisphere is half the star's surface. Oh wait, no, wait the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots would be 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4 π R². So the spots cover 0.1 π R², which is 2.5% of the total surface. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing a dip in brightness each time.

But wait, the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is R_sun. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K? Because the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K less. So the spots are 5000K.

But how does this affect the brightness variation? Oh, right, because when a spot is on the side facing us, it emits less light than the rest of the star. So the total brightness of the star as observed would decrease when a spot is in view. So the dip in brightness depends on the area of the spot and the temperature difference.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet transiting the star. So we want to find the planet's radius that would cause the same change in brightness. That is, the dip in brightness due to the planet blocking light is equal to the dip caused by the spots. Or wait, actually, the spots are cooler regions, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the total emitted flux is less than when they are not. So when a spot is on the side facing us, the brightness drops a bit, and when it's on the far side, it goes back up. But a planet would block some of the light when it transits; that dip would be more like a sharp decrease when it's in front.

Wait, but the question says to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So the maximum dip in brightness (the amplitude) should be the same. So the amplitude due to the planet would be the area blocked, which is (R_planet / R_star)^2. The amplitude due to the spots is the difference in flux from the spots compared to the normal star.

Wait, the star's total flux without spots is F_total = σ T_eff^4 * 4 π R² / (4 π d²) ), but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the flux from a spot is lower. So the total flux when a spot is on the hemisphere would be the normal flux minus the flux from the spot.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the star as two regions: the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted. The unspotted hemisphere emits at T_eff = 6000K, and the spotted hemisphere is at 5000K. But wait, the filling factor is 20% for the spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is spots, and the rest is normal. Hmm, but when the star rotates, how much of the spotted area is visible.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the maximum change in brightness. The star's brightness when the spot is facing us is lower than when it's not. The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4 π R^2) / (4 π d²) ) = σ T_eff^4 R^2 / d². When the star is spotted, the flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (σ T_spot^4 - σ T_eff^4) / something?

Wait, maybe I should calculate the change in flux when the spot is visible. Let me think. The entire star emits with a certain flux. The spots emit less. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = F_unspotted_hemisphere + F_spotted_hemisphere.

The unspotted hemisphere would emit F_un = (π R^2) * σ T_eff^4, because the area is π R² (half the sphere), and the flux per unit area is σ T^4. Wait, no, the flux from a hemisphere is (area) * (σ T^4). So the unspotted hemisphere emits (π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

The spotted hemisphere: the filling factor is 20%, so the area of spots is 0.2 * π R². The rest of the hemisphere is at T_eff. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is (0.8 * π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux per unit area of the spotted hemisphere. The average flux from the spotted hemisphere would be:

(0.8 * σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 * σ (5000)^4 ) * R².

Wait, no. Let me think: each point on the spotted hemisphere emits either at 6000K or 5000K, depending on whether it's a spot. So the average flux per unit area (emissive power) is:

(0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4) * σ.

So the total flux from the spotted hemisphere is π R² * σ * (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 * 5000^4).

The unspotted hemisphere emits π R² * σ * 6000^4.

So when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere facing us, the total flux is:

F_spotted = (π R² σ 6000^4 ) * (1) + (π R² σ ) * (0.8 *6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 )

Wait, no. Wait, the spotted hemisphere is the one we're looking at. So the flux would be the sum of the unspotted hemisphere (which is always emitting) and the spotted hemisphere's flux.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's flux is the sum of the flux from the front (spotted) hemisphere and the back (unspotted) hemisphere. But wait, no: the back hemisphere isn't visible. Wait, no, the star is a sphere. So when we look at the star, we see the front hemisphere. The back hemisphere's light doesn't reach us because it's on the other side.

Wait, no. Wait, the entire star's surface emits light, but when only the front hemisphere is visible (like a sphere), the light comes only from that part. So when the star rotates, and the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere is the spotted one, and the back is the unspotted. No, wait, no: the star's surface is a sphere. If the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is the front when viewed from Earth. So when the star is in a position where the spotted hemisphere is the front, we see that hemisphere. When it's rotated, the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for spots on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is the sum of the unspotted parts of that hemisphere and the spotted parts.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the flux when the star is in the position where the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, and when it's when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, let me define F_max as the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and F_min when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

So F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. The flux is the entire area of the unspotted hemisphere. Wait, no, the unspotted hemisphere is the other side. Wait, no, the star is divided into two hemispheres: one is spotted (20% filled with spots), the other is unspotted. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere doesn't have spots, so the flux is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: the northern and southern, say. One hemisphere (say, the northern) is 20% covered in spots. The southern is entirely unspotted. So when the star's rotation brings the northern hemisphere into view, we see the spots, leading to lower flux. When the southern hemisphere is visible, all unspotted, so higher flux.

So F_max is when the southern (unspotted) hemisphere is facing us. F_min is when the northern (spotted) hemisphere is facing us.

So F_max is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, which is π R² * σ * (6000)^4.

F_min is the flux from the spotted hemisphere. The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area as spots. So the flux is:

F_min = (0.8) * π R² * σ * (6000^4) + (0.2) * π R² * σ * (5000^4).

Wait, no: because each spot has a lower temperature, so the flux from each spot is less.

So F_min is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part of the northern hemisphere and the spotted part.

Wait, but when the northern hemisphere is facing us, the southern is on the back, so we don't see it. So F_min is the flux from the northern hemisphere only.

So F_min is the flux from the northern hemisphere, which is spotted. The northern hemisphere's total flux is:

(0.8 * π R²) * σ * (6000^4) + (0.2 * π R²) * σ * (5000^4).

So the change in flux when the star rotates is ΔF = F_max - F_min.

Wait, but F_max is when the southern hemisphere is visible, which is unspotted and emits at 6000K. So F_max = π R² * σ * (6000)^4.

F_min is when the northern hemisphere is visible:

F_min = [0.8 * π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.2 * π R² * σ (5000)^4 ].

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between F_max and F_min, divided by F_max, perhaps. Or wait, the dip is F_max - F_min, and the relative dip is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

But wait, the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So the amplitude (the depth) of the brightness dip when the planet transits would be (R_planet/R_star)^2, right? Because the planet blocks that fraction of the star's light.

So we need to set this dip equal to the dip caused by the spots. So:

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, but F_max is the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F_unspotted_hemisphere = π R² * σ (6000)^4. But wait, no: when the unspotted hemisphere is the front, the entire π R² area emits at 6000K, so F_max = π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_min is when the spotted hemisphere is front, so it's [0.8 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² σ (5000)^4 ].

So the difference is F_max - F_min = π R² σ (6000)^4 - [0.8 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.2 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - 0.8 (6000)^4 - 0.2 (5000)^4 ]

= π R² σ [ 0.2 (6000)^4 - 0.2 (5000)^4 ]

= 0.2 π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]

So the dip in flux is ΔF = 0.2 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The relative dip is ΔF / F_max.

F_max is π R² σ (6000)^4.

So ΔF / F_max = [0.2 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ π R² σ (6000)^4 ]

Simplify:

0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 ≈ 0.51775.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So ΔF / F_max ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355% dip.

Wait, but that can't be right because the dip is about 10% of the star's flux. But when a planet transits, the dip is (R_planet/R_star)^2. So (R_planet/R_sun)^2 = 0.10355.

So R_planet = R_sun * sqrt(0.10355) ≈ R_sun * 0.322.

Wait, but let's compute sqrt(0.10355). 0.1 is about 0.316, so 0.10355 is a bit higher.

Calculating sqrt(0.10355):

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.322^2 = (0.32)^2 + (0.002)*2*0.32 + 0.002^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684.

Which is close to our 0.10355. So sqrt is approximately 0.322.

So R_planet / R_star ≈ 0.322.

Wait, but let's check the options. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

So that's closest to D) 0.32.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, but the planet's radius is relative to the host star. So yes, the ratio is correct.

But let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So 20% of (π R²) is area of spots, which is 0.2 π R². But I think I accounted for that correctly in the calculation.

Wait, when the spotted hemisphere is front, the flux is 0.8 * (6000^4) * π R² + 0.2 * (5000^4) * π R². So that's correct.

So the dip is the difference between F_max (unspotted hemisphere) and F_min (spotted hemisphere). So:

F_max = π R² σ (6000)^4,

F_min = [0.8 (6000^4) + 0.2 (5000^4)] * π R² σ.

So ΔF = F_max - F_min = π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.8 6000^4 + 0.2 5000^4) ].

Which simplifies to π R² σ [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) ].

Then the relative dip is that divided by F_max, which is 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) / 6000^4.

Which is 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4) ≈ 0.2*(1 - 0.48225) ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355% of the star's maximum flux.

So the planet's radius would need to cause the same dip. So (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p ≈ 0.322 R_s.

Looking at the options, that's option D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the flux changes caused by the spots and equate them to the flux change caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is spotty, with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total flux depends on the area and temperature of its surface. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots.
   - The maximum flux (\( F_{\text{max}} \)) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.
   - The minimum flux (\( F_{\text{min}} \)) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

3. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The flux from a surface area is proportional to \( \sigma T^4 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - The total flux from the unspotted hemisphere:
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - The total flux from the spotted hemisphere:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = 0.8 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.2 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (5000)^4
     \]
   - The change in flux (\( \Delta F \)) is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( F_{\text{max}} \) and \( F_{\text{min}} \):
     \[
     \Delta F = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ (6000)^4 - \left( 0.8 (6000)^4 + 0.2 (5000)^4 \right) \right]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta F = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \cdot 0.2 \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]
     \]

4. **Relative Brightness Variation**:
   - The relative dip in brightness is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \cdot 0.2 \left[ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right]}{\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \cdot \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225
     \]
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \cdot \left[ 1 - 0.48225 \right] = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
     \]
   - The relative dip is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

5. **Exoplanet Radius**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).
   - Equate the relative dip caused by the planet to the relative dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
