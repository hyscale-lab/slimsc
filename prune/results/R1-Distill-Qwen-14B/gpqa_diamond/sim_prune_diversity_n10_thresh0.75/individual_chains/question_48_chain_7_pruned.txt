Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from cyclohexanone. There are four steps, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

First, let me break down each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1.

Hmm, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine. Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine (Br2) usually can add to double bonds, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, if you have a ketone and bromine, maybe it's an addition. Or, perhaps it's an epoxidation? No, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond for that. Wait, maybe it's a bromination via some other mechanism. Oh wait, wait, another possibility: the alpha position. So cyclohexanone has alpha carbons (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl). So bromine can add via an enolate. Oh wait, but that's more of a base-induced reaction. Alternatively, maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts bromination? But wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, which is activating for electrophilic substitution. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation of arenes, but cyclohexanone is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone, so perhaps it's undergoing some kind of electrophilic substitution. Wait, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol mechanism. So, when a ketone is treated with HBr, it can lead to the formation of a bromohydrin. But wait, the reagent here is Br2. Oh wait, another possibility: bromine can add to the carbonyl oxygen. So, when a ketone reacts with bromine, it forms a bromoketone via the Baeyer-Villiger reaction? No, wait, Baeyer-Villiger involves oxidation. Maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is acting as an oxid
