Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think I should probably draw it out or count the bonds to figure out how many of each type are present.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be found using bond energies. The formula I remember is: Enthalpy of Reaction (ΔH) = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products). But wait, wait, no, actually, when forming a molecule from its elements, you break the bonds in the reactants and form the bonds in the products. So the formula is probably the other way around: products minus reactants. Let me get that straight.

Wait, no, wait. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, in terms of bond energies, you can think of it as the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (which are elements, so like C and H) and then the energy released when the bonds in the product (the molecule) form.

So the general approach is:

ΔHf° (product) = [Σ (Bond energies of elements
