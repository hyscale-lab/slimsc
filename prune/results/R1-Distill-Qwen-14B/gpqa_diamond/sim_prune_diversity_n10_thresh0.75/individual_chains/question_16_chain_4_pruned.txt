Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to figure out which of the given compounds are chiral.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait the double bond is at position 1-ene, so maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. Let me think. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2?) No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. And 2-methyl would be a methyl group on the second carbon. So structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait, but it's but-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl attached to C1. So the molecule would be ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, that's butane. Oh wait, the starting point is but-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, but that's butane with a Cl.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking this wrong. Maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 2-methyl. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C
