Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Also, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry or is meso, it won't have optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are nitro groups at 6,6' and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. So, each phenyl ring has two substituents. Are the rings connected in a way that causes asymmetry? Biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in a position that creates a chiral center. Wait, no, the carbons attached to the rings probably aren't chiral centers because they're attached to two phenyl groups and two other groups. Wait, wait, the substituents are on the phenyl rings. Do those positions lead to any chiral centers? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, if the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical. Let me think, the positions are symmetric across the central bond. So maybe each side mirrors the other. If so, the molecule might not have optical isomers. Alternatively, maybe the substituent arrangement leads to a chiral center elsewhere. I'm a bit confused here. I'll come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is also attached to a methyl group, the ester group, and the central carbon. Let's see: the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH group,
- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- COOCH3 (ester group attached to the third carbon),
- and a hydrogen? Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would make it CH2(OH)CH2COO- and then the ester is CH3-O-CO-... Wait, wait, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. The ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. So the carbon in the middle (the second carbon) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and another H? Wait, no, the second carbon would be CH2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Propanoate has three carbons: 1, 2, 3. 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2. So
