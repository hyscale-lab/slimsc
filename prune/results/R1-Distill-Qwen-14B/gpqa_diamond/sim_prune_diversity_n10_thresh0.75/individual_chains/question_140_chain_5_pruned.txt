Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, it reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 

Then, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.

Hmm, okay, let's parse this. I'll start by thinking about possible substances that fit these clues.

First, the reaction between X and Y. It's violent, and a gas is released. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So what gases have the same number of protons and neutrons? Let's think: possible candidates could be H2, but that has 1 proton and 1 neutron each. Or maybe CO2? No, wait, CO2 has a different setup. Wait, wait. Wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for example, if it's H2O, then each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium?), but wait, but H2O as a moleculeâ€”each H is 1 p, and O is 8 p. So the total protons in H2O would be 2 + 8 =10, and total neutrons would be 2*(0 for H, assuming H is protium) + 8 (for O's 8 neutrons) =8. Wait, that doesn't match. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the gas W is something else. Let me think. Let's think of diatomic gases. Let's consider H2: each H has one proton. So two protons, and each H could be protium or deuterium. If it's H2, then each H has 1 proton and (assuming protium) 0 neutrons. So the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But wait, the problem says "the same number of neutrons and protons" in the molecule. So for H2, 2 protons and 0 neutrons. No, that's not same. So maybe another gas.

Another possibility is O2. O has 8 protons. So O2 would have 16 protons. The number of neutrons in O2: each O has 8 protons, so if it's ^16O, that's 8 neutrons each. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Wait, that's the same. So W could be O2. But wait, the reaction between X and Y produces O2? Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, another possibility is NH3? No, because it's a molecule, but
