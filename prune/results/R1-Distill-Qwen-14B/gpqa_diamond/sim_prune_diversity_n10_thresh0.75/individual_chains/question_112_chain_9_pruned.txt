Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that |alpha> is a state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> are orthonormal states, which form a basis for the spin space.

The question then asks me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, matrix elements. Let's think about what that matrix looks like.

First, for a two-level system (since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down), the matrix would be 2x2. So for i and j being 1 and 2 (assuming |up> is 1 and |down> is 2), the diagonal elements (where i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix A is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no. Wait, let me check: the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so this operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of such an operator would form the basis for measurement. So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the corresponding eigenstates in the state |alpha>.

But first, let me normalize the state |alpha> because the problem says it's proportional to that combination. The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To find the actual state, I need to normalize it.

To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide by the square root of that.

So, compute |alpha|^2: <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Wait, because the states |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero, so the cross terms (like (1+i)(2-i) and (2-i)(1+i)) will vanish when taking the inner product. So <alpha|alpha> is just |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each modulus squared:

|1 + i| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so |1+i|^2 = 2.

|2 - i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5), so |2 - i|^2 = 5.

So <alpha|alpha> = 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, so the state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to determine the eigenstates of the operator A. The operator A is given by the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Let me denote hbar as ħ for simplicity.

The eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix for A - λ I is:

[ -λ, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) = 0. So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4 → λ = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

What about the eigenvectors? For each eigenvalue, we solve (A - λ I) |v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:

A - (ħ/2) I = [ -ħ/2, ħ/2; ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]

The equations become:
-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0
ħ/2 v1 - ħ/2 v2 = 0

These are the same equation, so v1 = v2. So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, 1]. Well, but wait, wait: for λ = ħ/2, the equations are:

(-λ) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So any vector (a, a) is an eigenvector. To make it a unit vector, we can take (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

The matrix becomes [ ħ/2, ħ/2; ħ/2, ħ/2 ]

The equations:

(ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = -v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1), and normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates of A are |e1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue ħ/2, and |e2> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me check
