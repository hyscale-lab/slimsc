Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay and probability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. That would mean the probability it hasn't decayed by 100 minutes is 100% minus 32%, which is 68%. 

Wait, but wait. Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So, the probability of decay is memoryless. Oh right, the key here is that the process is memoryless. That means the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Hmm, so even if 50 minutes have gone by and it hasn't decayed, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of the previous time.

Wait, but wait a second. The given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. So, I think the decay follows an exponential decay model. The formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. 

So, given that P(100) = 0.32, I can find λ. Let's compute that. 

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.7 is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less. Let me think, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, we can consider the remaining time from the current point. Wait, no, the decay is a continuous process. So, the total time we're considering is 150 minutes from now. But wait, the time that has already passed (50 minutes) doesn't affect the remaining probability because of the memoryless property.

Wait, but the initial 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes from now. Alternatively, it's the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 to t=200. But the decay process is memoryless, so the probability is the same as if we started fresh and asked for 150 minutes. 

Wait, but let me think again. The usual way to model this is that the probability of decay in any given interval is the same as if it were starting fresh. So the probability of decay in the next t minutes is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Wait, but the initial condition here is that 50 minutes have passed without decay. So, what is the probability now that it decays in the next 150 minutes? Alternatively, it's the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past. Because the process is memoryless, the past doesn't affect the future decay probability.

So, for the next 150 minutes, the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150). 

I've already calculated λ as approximately 0.0038566 per minute. Let's compute P(150).

So, λ * 150 = 0.0038566 * 150 ≈ 0.57849. 

e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 is about 0.439, or 43.9%. 

Looking at the options, option D is 48%, option C is 52%, option A is 44%. So 43.9% is closest to 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of λ. Let's be more precise. Because 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking ln on both sides:

-100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Calculating ln(0.68) accurately. Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(1 - 0.32) which is about -0.385662. So, λ is 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, λ*t = 0.00385662 * 150 = 0.578493.

e^(-0.578493) is approximately 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 is 0.4393, which is about 43.93%. So the closest option is A) 44%.

Wait, but the options have A) 44%, D) 48%, etc. So, 44% is option A.

But wait another thing. Is the question asking about the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50? Or is it asking about the same way as the initial 100 minutes?

No, wait. The given decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the decay is modeled as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λ t). So, if we have already gone 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from t=0. Because the process is memoryless.

Alternatively, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=50+150=200 is equal to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ*150).

But wait, another approach: the probability that it hasn't decayed by t is e^(-λ t). So the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). The probability that it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes is e^(-λ *200). So, the conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 given it hasn't decayed by 50 is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) = 1 - e^(-λ *150), which is the same as the previous approach.

So I think that approach is correct.

So, the probability is approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%, so option A.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 44%, but option A is 44% and D is 48%. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute λ: ln(0.68) = ?

Let me compute ln(0.68) more precisely. Let me use a calculator in my mind.

We know that ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and ln(0.68) is a bit lower. Let me think: 0.68 is 0.7 minus 0.02. So, using a Taylor expansion for ln(x) around x=0.7.

Alternatively, use a calculator approach. Let's compute ln(0.68):

We know that e^-0.385 ≈ 0.68.

Wait, because e^-0.385 = 1/(e^0.385). e^0.385 is approximately 1.469. So 1/1.469 ≈ 0.68. So, yeah, λ is 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, but I used 0.38566 earlier. Let me compute e^(-0.578493) more precisely.

So, 0.578493 is approximately 0.5785.

e^{-0.5785} = 1 / e^{0.5785}.

What's e^{0.5785}? e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.6 is about 1.8221. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Compute e^{0.5785}:

Let me use the Taylor expansion around 0.5:

e^{0.5} = 1.64872

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so the slope at x=0.5 is 1.64872.

So, for x = 0.5 + delta, e^x ≈ e^{0.5} * (1 + delta * e^{0.5} + ... )

Wait, delta = 0.0785.

So, e^{0.5785} ≈ e^0.5 * (1 + 0.0785 * e^0.5 )

= 1.64872 * (1 + 0.0785 * 1.64872 )

Calculate 0.0785 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.1297.

So, 1 + 0.1297 = 1.1297.

So, e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.1297 ≈ 

Let me compute 1.64872 * 1.1297:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.1 = 0.164872

1.64872 * 0.02 = 0.0329744

1.64872 * 0.0097 ≈ approx 0.015997.

Adding up:

1.64872 + 0.164872 = 1.813592.

1.813592 + 0.0329744 = 1.8465664.

1.8465664 + 0.015997 ≈ 1.86256.

So e^{0.5785} ≈ 1.8626.

So e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 / 1.8626 ≈ 0.537.

Wait, wait. Because 1.8626 is e^{0.5785}, so e^{-0.5785} = 1/1.8626 ≈ 0.537.

So 1 - 0.537 = 0.463, which would be 46.3% probability.

Wait, that's about 46%, but earlier calculation with a rough estimate gave 43.9%. So something's conflicting here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the e^{0.5785} calculation. Let me compute e^{0.5785} more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, let me think of 0.5785 as approximately 0.58.

What is e^0.58?

We know that e^0.5 is 1.64872, e^0.6 is 1.82211.

Compute e^0.58:

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and 0.58 is 0.08 above 0.5.

So, the slope at x=0.5 is e^0.5 = 1.64872. The derivative is also 1.64872.

So, e^{0.5 + 0.08} ≈ e^0.5 * (1 + 0.08 * e^0.5 )

= 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08 * 1.64872 )

Compute 0.08 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.1319.

So, 1 + 0.1319 = 1.1319.

So, e^{0.58} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.1319 ≈ 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.1319 ≈ 0.2173. So total ≈ 1.64872 + 0.2173 ≈ 1.866.

So e^{0.58} ≈ 1.866. Therefore, e^{-0.58} ≈ 1/1.866 ≈ 0.5358. So 1 - 0.5358 = 0.4642, or 46.42%.

Hmm, but earlier, with a more precise approach, I thought it was about 43.9% when I used 0.5785. So which is correct?

Wait, maybe I need to recompute λ again.

Wait, the initial data was that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%. So,

P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68

Take natural log:

-100λ = ln(0.68)

λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68) accurately.

I can compute it using a calculator approximation. Let me think: ln(0.68) is approximately?

We know that ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108256,

ln(0.68) is higher than that (since 0.68 > 0.6). Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=0.7. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using e^x=0.68.

Let me compute ln(0.68).

We can use natural logarithm tables in mind, but perhaps it's easier to approximate.

Alternatively, let me use the formula: ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b.

Wait, perhaps I can write 0.68 as 68/100 = 17/25.

But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Taylor expansion of ln(x) around x = 0.68, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation for ln(x) near x=0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute ln(0.68) more directly.

Wait, let me think of it this way: the natural log of 0.68 is equal to the negative of the natural log of (1/0.68) ≈ 1.470588.

So, ln(0.68) = -ln(1/0.68) = -ln(1.470588).

Now, ln(1.470588) can be calculated.

We know that ln(1.4) ≈ 0.33647,

ln(1.47) is higher.

We can approximate using the Taylor expansion around x=1.4.

Alternatively, perhaps it's quicker to recall that ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.38566.

Wait, because e^0.38566 ≈ 1.470588. Because e^0.385 is approximately 1.469, as I thought earlier.

So, ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.38566.

Which would make ln(0.68) = -0.38566.

So, λ = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, for 150 minutes, λt = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

So, e^{-0.57849} = 1 / e^{0.57849}.

What's e^{0.57849}?

We can compute this as follows.

We know that e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872,

e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211.

0.57849 is 0.5 + 0.07849.

So, let's compute e^0.57849 as e^{0.5} * e^{0.07849}.

We've got e^0.5 = 1.64872.

Now, e^0.07849 can be approximated using the Taylor series:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6.

x = 0.07849.

x^2 = 0.07849^2 ≈ 0.00616.

x^3 ≈ 0.07849^3 ≈ 0.000483.

So,

e^{0.07849} ≈ 1 + 0.07849 + 0.00616/2 + 0.000483/6.

Which is 1 + 0.07849 = 1.07849,

plus 0.00616/2 = 0.00308 → 1.08157,

plus 0.000483/6 ≈ 0.0000805 → 1.08165.

So, e^{0.07849} ≈ 1.08165.

So, e^{0.57849} = e^{0.5} * e^{0.07849} ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08165.

Compute that:

1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08) = 1.64872 + 0.1318976 ≈ 1.7806176.

But since 1.08165 is 1.08 plus 0.00165, so 0.00165 * 1.64872 ≈ 0.00272.

So, total is approximately 1.7806176 + 0.00272 ≈ 1.7833376.

So, e^{0.57849} ≈ 1.7833. Therefore, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 1/1.7833 ≈ 0.5607.

So, 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 → 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.

So, the probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%, option A.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of 150 minutes, I got 46% when I considered e^{-0.58} as 0.5358, but perhaps I made a mistake in those approximations.

In any case, the correct approach is to calculate λ based on the given 100-minute data, then compute 1 - e^(-λ * 150), which comes out to approximately 43.9%, so 44%.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we start by analyzing the given data. The decay probability of the atom within 100 minutes is 32%, which implies that the probability of the atom not decaying within 100 minutes is:

\[
P(\text{not decay in 100 minutes}) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

The decay process follows an exponential decay model, where the probability of decay by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Here, \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. Using the given data (\( P(100) = 0.32 \)), we can solve for \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Now, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. The probability of not decaying in 150 minutes is:

\[
P(\text{not decay in 150 minutes}) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5607
\]

Thus, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-0.57849} \approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393 \, \text{or} \, 43.93\%.
\]

This rounds to approximately 44%. Since the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay does not affect the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

From the given options:

- **A) 44%**: Matches the calculated probability.
- **B) 40%**: Too low.
- **C) 52%**: Too high.
- **D) 48%**: Slightly higher than the calculated value.

The closest and most accurate answer is **44%**.

Answer: A
