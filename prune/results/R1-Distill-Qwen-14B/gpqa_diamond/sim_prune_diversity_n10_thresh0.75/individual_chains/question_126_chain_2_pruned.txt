Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is how many peaks the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

Hmm, right. So I'll need to figure out the products of each reaction first, then see what the combined products are, and then think about how they would behave in the HPLC columns.

Starting with Reaction I. The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is a hexan-3-one (so a ketone at C3) with a methoxy group at C5. The configuration is S, but wait, for a ketone, the configuration depends on the substituents. But maybe that's more about the starting material.

LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the 3-ketone would become a 3-ol. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol?

Wait, no. Wait, let me draw the structure. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2... Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, hexane is six carbons. So positions 1 to 6.

So hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3? Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, or perhaps better to think as CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No,
