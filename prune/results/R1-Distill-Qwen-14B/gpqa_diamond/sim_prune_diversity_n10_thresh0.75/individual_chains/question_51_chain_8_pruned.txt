Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system. And then there are four options to choose from.

Alright, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics involves the work done to bring charges together. But wait, the system here has a grounded conducting sphere. Grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow into the ground. But wait, the sphere is a conductor, so charges can move freely on its surface.

So, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. The sphere is conducting and grounded, so when we bring q near it, the sphere will induce charges. But since it's grounded, any induced charges on the sphere would cause charges to leave or enter the sphere? Wait, no, wait. For a conducting sphere, the charges will redistribute, but the grounding allows the sphere to maintain a neutral charge if possible. Hmm, maybe in this setup, the induced charges on the sphere would cause a redistribution, but because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere might be zero? Or does the presence of q affect that?

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the charges in the conductor redistribute. For a grounded sphere, the induced charges cannot stay on the sphere because they can flow into the ground. So, the sphere remains neutral. But wait, that's only if the sphere is isolated and initially neutral. Oh,
