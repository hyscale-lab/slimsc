Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (I think that's PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base of H3PO4 after two deprotonations. First, H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (that's the first dissociation, with Ka1), then H2PO4^- loses another to become HPO4^2- (Ka2), and then HPO4^2- loses another to become PO4^3- (Ka3). But wait, in this case, we have two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course.

So, in the solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, these two can interconvert via the second dissociation step because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, but in this solution, I don't have HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3- directly because the pH might not be that high. Alternatively, maybe the phosphate species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so perhaps the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, then see if any PO4^3- is present.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So, maybe I should think about the possible dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

The relevant Ka here is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. Ka3 is for the reaction HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. So if the solution's pH is high enough, then the HPO4^2- can deprotonate further to form PO4^3-.

But wait, considering that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps the pH is around the pKa2 value, which is around 7.8 (since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is about 7.21). So, the pH being near 7.2 would mean that H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a buffer. But for PO4^3- to be significant, we'd need the solution to be at a pH near pKa3, which is around 11.7 (since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, pKa3 is about 11.74). But if the pH is around 7.2, the solution is probably acidic enough that HPO4^2- doesn't dissociate much into PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, maybe the phosphate species could undergo some hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solubility of the salts and the way their ions influence each other.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Find the pH of the solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation since it's a buffer solution (with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-).
4. Use the pH to find the extent to which HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.
5. Calculate the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but step 4 might not be necessary if the pH is below pKa3, meaning that the HPO4^2- is more likely to act as an acid (donate a proton) rather than a base (accept a proton). So, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is negligible. But the problem asks specifically for the concentration, so maybe I need to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe the contribution from each salt is such that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the moles of each component.

Moles of KH2PO4:

Mass = 1.00 g, Mw = 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 moles.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^- and 1 mole of K+.

So, H2PO4^- concentration is 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

Now, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005603 moles.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2- and 2 moles of Na+.

So, HPO4^2- concentration is 0.005603 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028015 M.

Now, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Since these two are in a buffer, I can apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- because in the second dissociation, H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2).

So, pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21.

So, pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Plugging in the concentrations:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028015 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M.

So the ratio is (0.028015)/(0.0367) ≈ 0.763.

Log(0.763) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.21 - 0.115 = 7.095.

So, the pH is about 7.1.

Now, the next step is to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The reaction is: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3 = 1.8e-12, so pKa3 ≈ 11.74.

The pH of the solution is 7.1, which is much lower than pKa3. So, the solution is more acidic than the pKa3. In such a case, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the conjugate base (PO4^3-) is favored when pH > pKa.

But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Let's calculate it.

The expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this
