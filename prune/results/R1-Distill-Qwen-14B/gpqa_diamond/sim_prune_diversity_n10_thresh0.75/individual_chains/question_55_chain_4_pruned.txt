Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of protons, and the splitting tells about neighboring protons.

First, I should think about what each of these options looks like structurally. Acetates are esters, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so it's an ester group. The groups attached would determine the NMR shifts.

The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans. So, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond, so it's CH2CHCH2, but in the case of propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. But wait, maybe the substituent is propenyl, so maybe it's CH2CH2CH3, no, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me clarify. The substituent is either propenyl or butenyl. So, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent attached to the acetate. But wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure of, say, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no, the correct structure is that the propenyl group is connected to the oxygen of the ester. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should write the structures.

Wait,
