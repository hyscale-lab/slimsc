Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the a-d options.

Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, higher mass and smaller volume would lead to higher density. So I need to figure out the mass and volume of each option.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. That's what I remember. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the density is given directly here. So this planet's density is 5.5 as well. But wait, mass is 2 Earth masses. But since density is defined as mass/volume, if the density is the same, but the mass is higher, the volume must also be higher. Hmm, but the question is about which has the highest density. So if the density is same as Earth, this one is 5.5. So same as a? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me recheck. The question says option b's density is approximately 5.5. So whether its mass is more, but if the density is same, then it's same as Earth. So a and b have same density?

Wait, that can't be right. Because for same composition, the density might differ, but if the composition is same, then same density, but they're not necessarily the same. Wait, the options are more specific.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition, so same density. Because composition determines density. So if Earth has a certain density, same composition would mean same density. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet's density is 5.5 as well. But wait, more mass. How does that affect it?

Wait, but if the mass increases but composition is same, then the planet's volume would increase as well. Because density is mass/volume. So if mass increases, volume increases proportionally, keeping density same. So in
