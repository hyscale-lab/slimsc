Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that an organic chemist performed two reactions and then combined the products. They ran these products on two types of HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. We have to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Starting with the reactions:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.
Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

We need to determine the products of each reaction first.

Let me tackle Reaction I first. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3, and a methoxy group at position 5. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, wait, no, let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3. So, position 3 is the ketone.

Hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Carbon 1: CH3, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: C=O, Carbon 4: CH2, Carbon 5: CH2, Carbon 6: CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe more accurately:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, wait, no. Hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I need to count correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one has six carbons. So, it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No
