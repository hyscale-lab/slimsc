Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem gives some specific details, and I need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. 

Alright, let me go through the information step by step. 

First, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, in terms of luminosity, mass might not be directly relevant unless it's about something like the star's stage in life or maybe its temperature. But wait, the problem does say to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, which makes me think we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity.

Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared multiplied by its temperature to the fourth power. So the formula is L = 4πσ R² T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, this should apply to both stars.

But wait, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same for both, then T1 = T2. Oh, that's an important point. So T1 = T2.

If that's the case, then the temperatures are equal, so when calculating the luminosity ratio, the T terms will cancel out. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) multiplied by (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that's just (R1²)/(R2²).
