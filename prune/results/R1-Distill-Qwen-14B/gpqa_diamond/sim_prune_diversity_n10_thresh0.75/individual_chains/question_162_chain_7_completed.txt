Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime, and from it we can find quantities like area or volume.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh right, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? Like, they have a saddle shape. But in this case, maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

So I need to find the area of this pseudosphere. The metric is in two dimensions, so it's probably describing the surface of the pseudosphere. Let me recall how to compute the area from a metric.

The area element in 2D for a metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy² is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, right? But in our case, the metric is diagonal because there are no cross terms (g_{xy}=0), so the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, it's g_xx * g_yy.

Looking at the given metric, the coefficients are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and similarly for g_yy. So the determinant, det(g), is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Because both g_xx and g_yy are the same, their product is the square.

So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Let's compute that. sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]²) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but to find the total area, I need to integrate dA over the entire surface. But what are the limits of integration? The metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y², which must be positive because otherwise we'd have a division by zero or a negative, which might not make sense in the metric.

So 4 - x² - y² > 0 implies x² + y² <4. So the domain is all (x,y) such that x² + y² <4, which is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the integration is over a circle of radius 2.

But wait, integrating [32/(4 - r²)] over this area where r² = x² + y². Maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, take the θ integral: it's 2π, so the whole integral becomes 2π * ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So 32 r dr = (-32/2) du = -16 du. Wait, when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-16 du) ?

Wait, maybe I made a substitution error. Let me do it step by step.

The integral is ∫ (32 r dr) / (4 - r²). Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0 → u=4. r=2 → u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2) ) 

That's (32 / 2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) (-du) = 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, because the limits change. So the negative flips the limits. So it's 16 ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

But wait, ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4? That's ln(u) evaluated from 0 to 4. Oh no, wait, ln(4) minus ln(0). But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity?

Wait, that can't be right. Because the metric is defined for r² <4, but perhaps the surface itself is not a regular sphere but a pseudosphere, which might have infinite area.

Wait, but the pseudosphere is a finite area? Or does it have infinite area because of its curvature?

Hmm, pseudospheres have finite surface area. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, the pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, has finite area. But wait, maybe in this case, the metric is such that the integration leads to an infinite area. Because the denominator approaches zero at r=2, so the integrand becomes large there.

Wait, let me re-examine the integral. The integral is ∫ (from 0 to2) [32 r dr]/(4 - r²). Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2. The integral becomes ∫ (32) * (-du/2) / u. The limits: when r=0, u=4. r=2 → u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32 (-du/2)) / u.

Which is (32 * (-1/2)) ∫ from 4 to0 (1/u) du = (-16) [ ln(u) from 4 to 0 ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (-16) ( ln(0) - ln(4) ) ) = (-16) ( -infty - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, but then the area would be infinite. So looking back at the options, option D is +infty. But wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". So the area would be infinite?

But wait, I thought pseudospheres have finite area. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing with tractricoid. The tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere, has finite area. Wait, what's the difference?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is not the metric of a tractricoid but a different kind of surface with infinite area.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that in this metric, the area integral is divergent, leading to an infinite area.

So the options are:

A) 0

B)4pi(x^2 + y^2)

C)4pi(x^2 - y^2)

D)+infty

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but why is the area infinite? Because the metric is singular at r=2, and the denominator approaches zero. So near r=2, the area element blows up, making the total area infinite.

So the area is infinite, so the answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

and the task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To find the area, we use the area element in 2D, which is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( \det(g) \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal (\( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) and \( g_{xy} = 0 \)), the determinant is:

\[
\det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \) implies \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which is a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \( \theta \)-integration contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 16 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln(u) \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \( 0 \): Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B)** \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the result of the integration.
- **C)** \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \): Incorrect, as this is not the result of the integration.
- **D)** \( +\infty \): Correct, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
