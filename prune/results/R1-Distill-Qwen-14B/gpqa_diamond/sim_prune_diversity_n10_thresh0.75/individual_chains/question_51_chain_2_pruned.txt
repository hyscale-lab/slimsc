Okay, so I've got this physics problem about potential energy between a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when you have a grounded conducting sphere and another charge placed near it, there's some induced charge that happens. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are all expressions involving k, q squared, and terms with d and R squared. So I guess the potential energy depends on these variables.

I remember that for a conducting sphere, when it's grounded, any induced charges adjust so that the surface is an equipotential. Also, the sphere will have induced charges opposite to the charge q if q is outside the sphere. Wait, but since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface must be zero. Wait, no, that's not right. If it's grounded, the potential of the sphere's surface is the same as the ground, which is usually taken as zero.

So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's free electrons will redistribute, creating an induced charge. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be on the surface. The charge q will induce an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere, and the same charge on the far side, but wait, no. Let me think again. If q is positive, the conductor (sphere) will have the opposite charge induced on the near side, making the near side negative. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge on it would flow away. Wait, no. Wait, the sphere is a conductor and if it's grounded, any induced charges on it can't build up beyond what the ground allows. So when you bring a charge near, the sphere's induced charge adjusts until the surface is at the same potential as the ground.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of image charges. Oh right, the method of images might be helpful here. For a conducting sphere, the image charge method can be used to find the potential or force between the charge and the sphere.

The image charge method says that a charge q outside a conducting sphere can be represented by a charge q' located inside the sphere, such that the potential due to q and q' is the same as the potential due to the actual setup. But wait, how does that work for a grounded sphere?

Wait, when the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero.
