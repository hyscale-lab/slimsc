Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says that trans-cinnamaldehyde went through a series of reactions, and we need to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction step.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

Hmm, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde. The structure of cinnamaldehyde is a benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So, I think the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO, but the trans refers to the double bond, so the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde has the structure Ph-CHO, but wait that's benzaldehyde. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is a substituted aldehyde. Its structure is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Its structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, maybe it's Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal, so it's Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CHO, but no, wait, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that would be cinnamaldehyde as (E)-3-phenylpropenal. Wait, no. Let me get this right. Wait, the correct structure of cinnamaldehyde is CH₂=CH-C₆H₅CHO? No, wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Cinnamaldehyde is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Its structure
