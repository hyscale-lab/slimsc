Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, the question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path is determined by the probability of such interactions. If the interaction probability is high enough, the particles won't travel far without annihilating, which limits their lifetime in the universe.

So the process in question is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I think the cross-section for this process plays a role here. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that this interaction will occur.

I recall that the cross-section for pair production (which is what this is) by gamma-ray photons off CMB photons depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. The formula for the cross-section probably involves some terms with the energies of the photons involved.

Wait, the cross-section σ for this process might be proportional to (E_cm^2) / (E1 * E2), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy, and E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. Oh wait, no, maybe the cross-section formula is more about the square of the logarithm or something else. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by the formula σ = (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * log(s/(4m_e^2)), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, and α is the fine-structure constant. But I'm not certain about the exact form.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this using the concept of the interaction length or the optical depth. The optical depth τ is the product of the number density of the target photons and the cross-section, multiplied by the path length. For the gamma-ray's lifetime to be limited, the optical depth should be order 1, meaning that the probability of interaction is about 50% over the relevant distance.

The relevant distance here is probably the age of the universe. The age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, which is about 4.32e17 seconds. So the gamma-ray would have a mean free path λ, and the optical depth τ = n * σ * λ. If τ ≈ 1, then the energy is such that the cross-section is significant enough.

So let's model this. The number density n of CMB photons can be estimated. The CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The photon number density is (2ζ(3)/π²) * (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3), where ζ(3) is Apéry's constant, approximately 1.202. Alternatively, I might remember that the number density n_ph is roughly 411 photons per cubic cm.

Wait, but the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. But for CMB, the typical energy is about k_B T, which is approximately (8.617e-5 eV/K) * 2.7 K ≈ 2.3e-4 eV. Oh, but the question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so maybe I should use that as E2.

So, for a gamma-ray photon of energy E1 and a CMB photon of energy E2=1e-3 eV, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since E1 and E2 are much larger than their rest masses (which are negligible for photons), the s is approximately (E1 + E2)^2.

Wait, more precisely, the photons are massless, so their energy and momentum are related by E = pc. So, for two photons moving in opposite directions (since they're in a collision), their energies add in the center-of-mass frame. So the total energy in the CoM frame is sqrt(s) ≈ E1 + E2. But wait, if they're moving head-on, the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/c, depending on direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: For two photons moving in opposite directions, their energies add in the CoM frame. So the CoM energy is sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (c^2) ). Since photons have E = pc, so E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c.

Substituting, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? That can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I should consider them moving in opposite directions. So in that case, one photon has momentum +p1, the other -p2. So their energies are E1 and E2, and their momenta are p1 = E1/(c) and p2 = E2/(c), but in opposite directions.

So the total energy is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (p1 - p2) = (E1 - E2)/c, because p2 is in the opposite direction.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - [ (E1 - E2)^2 ] c^2 / c^2 ?

Wait, the invariant s is computed as (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. So:

sum E = E1 + E2
sum p c = p1 c - p2 c = (E1 - E2)

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

Ah, so s = (2 sqrt(E1 E2))^2. So the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2).

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum center-of-mass energy is when the photons are moving towards each other, and their energies add. So sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2).

Now, the cross-section for pair production in gamma-gamma collisions is given by:

σ = (8π/3) * (α^2) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (s) ) * ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)).

Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to recall that the cross-section depends on the logarithm of the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, for high-energy photons, the cross-section can be approximated as:

σ ≈ (8π α^2 / 3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / s * ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)).

But I'm a bit unsure about the exact dependence. Alternatively, I've heard that at high energies, the cross-section behaves as σ ~ (α^2 / (s)) * ln(s/m_e^2), which for s >> m_e^2 is approximately (α^2 / s) * ln(s/m_e^2).

But maybe for the purposes of this problem, I can approximate the cross-section as σ ≈ (constant) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2), since s ≈ 4 E1 E2. So,

σ ≈ (8π α^2 / 3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E1 E2) ) * ln( (4 E1 E2) / (4 m_e^2 c^4) )

Simplifying, that becomes:

σ ≈ (2 π α^2 m_e^2 c^4 ) / (3 E1 E2) ) * ln( E1 E2 / (m_e^2 c^4) )

Wait, but since E1 is much larger than E2 (given that E2 is 1e-3 eV and E1 is a gamma-ray, perhaps around GeV or higher), then E1 E2 ≈ E1^2, because E2 is negligible compared to E1. But wait, actually E2 is 1e-3 eV, and E1 is in GeV, so E1 is 1e9 eV, so E1 E2 is 1e6 eV^2, which is much larger than m_e^2 c^4, which is about (0.511 MeV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2= (5.11e5)^2 eV² = about 2.6e11 eV². Wait, no, wait: 0.511 MeV is 5.11e5 eV, so m_e c² is
