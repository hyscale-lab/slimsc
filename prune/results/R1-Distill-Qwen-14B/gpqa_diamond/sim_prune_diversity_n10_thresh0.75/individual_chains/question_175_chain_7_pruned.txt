Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole involved. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I think it's a dipole oscillating along that axis. So, it's a dipole radiator.

Dipole radiation has certain characteristics. The power radiated by a dipole depends on the cube of the frequency or the square of the angular frequency. Wait, no—wait, the power for a dipole is proportional to (ω^4), right? Because the radiated power P is ( (μ_0/(4π)) * ( (ω^4) * |d|^2 * sin^2θ) ) / c^3 ), where d is the dipole moment.

Wait, but that's the power per unit solid angle. Wait, no, the power is the integral over all solid angles. So the power per unit solid angle (like the function f) would be proportional to sin^2θ, right? Because the angular dependence for a dipole is sin²θ.

So when you integrate f over all solid angles (from 0 to π in θ and 0 to 2π in φ), you get the total power. But the problem says that the maximum power is A. So where is the maximum of f? Since f depends on sin²θ, the maximum would be at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so sin²θ is 1. At θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5, so sin²θ is 0.25.

Wait, but the function f would be the power per unit solid angle. So the fraction at θ=30 degrees would be f(30) divided by A. But wait, no—wait, A is the maximum power, which occurs at θ=90. So the actual fraction would be the ratio of f(30) to f(90), because the maximum is A.

Wait, let me think. The function f has a maximum at θ=90, which is A. So f(θ) = A * [sin²θ / sin²(90)] because when θ=90, sinθ=1, so f(90) = A * 1, which is A. So f(θ) = A sin²θ. Wait, no, because sin²(90) is 1, so f(θ) = A sin²θ.

Wait, then at θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 1/2, so sin^2θ is 1/4. So f(30) = A * (1/4). So the power at θ=30 is (1/4) A. So the fraction of A would be 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4, which would correspond to option C or B.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees". Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Because the function f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle at angle θ. So the total power at θ=30 degrees isn't just f(30), because you have to integrate over the solid angle at that θ. Wait no, the function f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle, so if you take f(θ) dΩ, that's the power in that direction. But wait, the maximum power A is the maximum of f(θ) times dΩ, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The radiated power per unit solid angle is given by f(λ,θ), and the maximum is A. So the function f has a maximum of A at θ=90 degrees. So the fraction at θ=30 would be f(30)/A.

Since f is proportional to sin²θ, f(30) would be A * [sin²(30°)] = A*(1/2)^2 = A*(1/4). So the fraction is (1/4 A) divided by A, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4. So that would be option B or C.

Looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the fraction. Now, the other part of the question is the form of f, which depends on λ.

I remember that in dipole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to ω^4, which is (2πf)^4. Since f is the frequency
