Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located in the qubits space. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, right? They're especially useful for mixed states, not just pure states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think I remember that when a density matrix is a mixture of the basis states, it might represent something about the qubit's state being in a superposition or maybe a mixed state. Let me think about what this matrix looks like.

Each term in the sum is a projector: |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix that has 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has 1 in the bottom-right corner. So when I add them together, I get a matrix that has 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So the density matrix should look like this:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because a maximally mixed state has the same probability for each basis state, which in this case is 1/2 each for |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the state isn't pure, it's a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states with pure states as points on the sphere's surface and mixed states as points inside.

The Bloch vector (or sometimes called the purity vector) for a qubit is given by r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me write out ρ again: ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me express this as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Wait, because I is the identity matrix, which would contribute (I)/2, and then the other terms would come from the Pauli matrices.

So, let's write out (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is 2x2, so (I/2) is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Now, the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-
