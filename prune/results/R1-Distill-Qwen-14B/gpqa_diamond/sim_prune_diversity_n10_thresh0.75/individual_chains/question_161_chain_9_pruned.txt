Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

So, Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, but some gas particles are still there. The mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? That depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the container.

Wait, when the mean free path is long, that means the gas is at a lower pressure because molecules don't collide as often. So in a good vacuum, λ1 is large. But when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2. And the question is about what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

So, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? The temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. Oh, wait, the electron beam might be causing some effect on the gas molecules. Like, maybe electrons are scattering off the gas molecules more, which would change their effective cross-section for collisions.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at high speeds. They might be interacting with the gas molecules. But how does that affect the mean free path? Hmm.

Oh, right, mean free path (λ) is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the effective diameter of the molecules, P is pressure, etc. But wait, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are getting ionized or excited? Or maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move more, but the temperature is the same, so that's probably not it.

Wait another thought: the presence of the electron beam could cause electrons to be scattered by the gas molecules. So the mean free path for electrons would be shorter, but wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. Or is it about the electrons' mean free path? Hmm, wait the question says Mike observed based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So perhaps the electrons are scattering more, which affects some parameter, but how does that relate to the gas molecules' mean free path?

Wait, perhaps the gas molecules
