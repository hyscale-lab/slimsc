Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. Let's jot down the given data:

- Temperature ratios:
  - Planet1/Planet2 ≈ 1.4
  - Planet2/Planet3 ≈ 2.3
- Mass ratios:
  - Planet1/Planet2 ≈ 1.15
  - Planet2/Planet3 ≈ 1.35
- Albedo is 0.3 for all.

And the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So the options are factors like 10, 3, 4, or 33.

Wait, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I think is something like T = [ (L*(1 - a))/(16πσd²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and d is the distance.

But wait, in this problem, all three planets have the same albedo, so a is 0.3 for each. So the equilibrium temperature ratio would depend on the square root of the inverse of their distances. Because T is proportional to (L(1-a))^(1/4) / (d^(1/2)).

Wait, let me think. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * π * σ * d² ) ]^(1/4). But when comparing two planets around the same star, L is the same, and a is same. So T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )^(1/2) ? Wait, wait. Let me get that right.

No, wait. Let me write it as T1 = T_eq1 = [ ( (1 - a) L )^(1/4) ] / ( (d1^(1/2)) * (16 π σ )^(1/4) )

Wait, maybe it's better to take the ratio of T1 and T2. So T1 / T2 = [ (d2/d1) ]^(1/2) ? No, wait.

Wait, correct formula. Equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L (1 - a))^(1/4) / (d)^(1/2). Because in the formula, T is proportional to ( (L*(1-a)) / d² )^(1/4 ). Which is same as (L(1-a))^(1/4) * d^(-1/2).

So T is proportional to (L(1-a))^(1/4) * d^(-1/2). Since L and a are same for all planets, the ratio T1/T2 would be (d2/d1)^(-1/2). Because:

T1/T2 = [ (d2/d1)^(-1/2) ] * [ (L(1-a))^(1/4) ] / [ (L(1-a))^(1/4) ) ] 

So the (L(1-a)) terms cancel, leaving T1/T2 = sqrt( d1 / d2 )

Wait, because (d2/d1)^(-1/2) is same as (d1/d2)^(1/2), which is sqrt(d1/d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d1/d2) 

So, given T1/T2 = 1.4, that would mean sqrt(d1/d2) = 1.4 → d1/d2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = d1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.5102 * d1.

Wait, but wait, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. So from the above, that would imply that d1 is about 1.96 times d2. So Planet1 is farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure. Because if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 (T1 > T2), then it must be closer, right? Because being closer would make it hotter. But according to the above ratio, since T1/T2=1.4, which is greater than 1, that would imply d1 < d2? Because T is inversely proportional to d^0.5.

Wait, let me recheck. Let me restate the formula correctly. T is proportional to ( (1 - a) L )^(1/4) * (d)^(-1/2). So when d increases, T decreases. So if T1 is larger than T2, then d1 must be smaller than d2. So Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

So, per the given data, T1/T2 = 1.4. So according to the formula, sqrt(d1/d2) = 1.4 → d1/d2= (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → d2 = d1 / 1.96 ≈ 0.509 d1. Wait, that can't be right. Because if d2 is less than d1, then Planet2 is closer, so its temperature would be higher, which would make T2 larger than T1, contradicting the given T1/T2 =1.4.

Wait, maybe I messed up the ratio. Let's re-derive.

Let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [( (1 - a) L ) / (16 π σ d² ) ]^(1/4 )

So, T is proportional to ( (1 - a) L )^(1/4 ) / d^(1/2 )

So, T1 / T2 = [ (1 - a) L )^(1/4 ) / d1^(1/2) ) ] / [ (1 - a) L )^(1/4 ) / d2^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify: T1/T2 = (d2^(1/2) ) / (d1^(1/2) ) ) = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

Because:

( (d2^(1/2)) ) / (d1^(1/2)) ) = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, if T1 is larger than T2, then sqrt( d2/d1 ) must be larger than 1 → d2/d1 > 1 → d2 > d1 → Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.

Wait, but that would mean that Planet2 is farther, so its temperature is lower than Planet1. But the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, so T1 is higher. So that makes sense.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ) → 1.4 = sqrt( d2/d1 )

Square both sides: (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

So Planet2 is 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3.

Using the same formula, T2/T3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Square both sides: d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29 → d3 = 5.29 * d2.

So, now we can find the distances:

d1 is the distance of Planet1.

d2 = 1.96 * d1

d3 = 5.29 * d2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * d1 → let's compute that.

5.29 * 1.96: 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 ≈ 0.5684. So total is approximately 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.37 * d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

But the question isn't about distance; it's about the orbital period. So we need to relate the orbital period to the distance. For that, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star), given by:

P^2 ∝ a^3 / M, where M is the mass of the star. Wait, but in this case, all planets are orbiting the same star, so M is the same for all. So P^2 ∝ a^3.

Wait, but Kepler's third law is usually written as (P^2) = (4π²/G(M)) * a^3. So when M is the same, P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So the period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 would be sqrt( (d3^3) / (d1^3) ) → because P3^2 / P1^2 = (d3^3)/(d1^3) → P3/P1 = sqrt( (d3^3)/(d1^3) ) = (d3/d1)^(3/2).

We already found that d3/d1 is approximately 10.37.

So (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2) → let's compute that.

First, 10.37 is about 10^(1) and a bit. So, 10.37^1 = 10.37. 10.37^0.5 is sqrt(10.37), which is approx 3.22. So 10.37^(3/2) = 10.37 * 3.22 ≈ let's compute.

10 * 3.22 is 32.2, 0.37 *3.22 is about 1.19. So total is about 33.39.

So the factor by which P3 is larger than P1 is approximately 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer is D.

Wait, but wait. The masses of the planets are given. Does that affect anything? Because Kepler's law in the form I used assumes that the star's mass is dominant, but if the planets are massive, does that change the calculation?

Oh, wait, in the Kepler's third law as applied to planets orbiting a star, the formula (P² = (4π² a³)/(G(M + m))) → but since the star's mass M is much larger than the planet's mass m, M + m ≈ M. So the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period. Therefore, the given mass ratios don't affect the calculation of the period in this context. So we can ignore the mass ratios for this problem.

So, the answer should be D, approximately 33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:  
   - The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:  
     \[
     T \propto \frac{(1 - a)^{1/4}}{d^{1/2}}
     \]  
     where \(a\) is the albedo and \(d\) is the distance from the star. Since the albedo \(a = 0.3\) is the same for all planets, the temperature ratio depends only on the distance ratio.  

   - For Planet1 and Planet2:  
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} \implies \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \implies \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1
     \]  

   - For Planet2 and Planet3:  
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} \implies \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \implies \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2
     \]  

   Combining the two results:  
   \[
   d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot d_1 \implies d_3 \approx 10.37 \cdot d_1
   \]  
   Thus, the distance of Planet3 is approximately 10.37 times that of Planet1.

2. **Orbital Period Ratio**:  
   Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the distance \(d\) by:  
   \[
   P^2 \propto d^3 \implies \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
   \]  
   Substituting \(d_3 / d_1 \approx 10.37\):  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
   \]  
   First, calculate \(10.37^{1/2} \approx 3.22\). Then:  
   \[
   (10.37)^{3/2} = 10.37 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.4
   \]  

3. **Mass Ratios**:  
   The given mass ratios between the planets do not affect the orbital period calculation because the star's mass dominates in Kepler's law. Thus, they can be ignored.

The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.
