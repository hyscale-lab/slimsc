Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions. The statement is incomplete, and I need to fill in the blanks with terms like stronger, weaker, faster, or slower. Then choose the correct combination from the options A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidizing agent relates to its standard electrode potential. The higher the potential, the stronger the oxidizing agent. So, I need to think about the standard reduction potentials of oxygen in different solutions.

Wait, what's the standard condition for oxygen? I think in acidic solution, the reaction for oxygen as an oxidant is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. The standard electrode potential for this is around +1.23 V. In basic solution, the reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, and the potential is also around +0.401 V, but wait—that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Because in basic solution, the H+ isn't present; it's OH- instead.

Wait, let me think again. Oh right, the standard reduction potential for O2 in acidic solution is higher (more positive). So, in acidic, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent. But wait, in the question, the first blank is about being an oxidant in basic solutions. So, the question is comparing thermodynamic aspects.

Wait, the first part says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So, comparing to acidic, since the E° is higher in acidic, meaning O2 is a stronger oxidant in acidic. So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant than in acidic.

But wait, thermodynamic strength is determined by the E° value. So if E° is higher in acidic, then in basic, it's lower, so O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. So the first blank should be 'weaker'.

Now the second part of the statement: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." Kinetically refers to the rate of reaction. So, how does the environment affect the reaction rate?

In acidic solution, the reaction might involve H+ ions, which could affect the reaction mechanism. For example, in acidic conditions, the reaction might have more ions around which can facilitate electron transfer, possibly making the reaction faster. Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic is faster because it's more thermodynamically favorable, but that's more about activation energy.

Wait, the kinetics can be influenced by the concentration of ions. In acidic solutions, there are H+ ions which are involved in the reaction, so perhaps the reaction is faster. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think about the actual reactions.

In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH-.

Which reaction would proceed faster? Well, the presence of H+ in acidic solution could help stabilize the transition state, perhaps making the reaction faster. Alternatively, maybe the basic solution has a higher pH, making the reaction slower because of the higher charge (since OH- is less charged than H+)—but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, another angle: the overpotential for O2 in acidic vs. basic. I remember that in acidic solutions, oxygen reduction can have lower overpotential, which means it's easier to proceed, hence faster reaction rates. For example, in fuel cells, the cathode reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a lower overpotential in acidic conditions. So, the reaction would be faster in acidic solutions.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic (since E° is lower) and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic (maybe because lower overpotential, higher reaction rate).

So looking at the options:

The first blank is 'weaker' because in basic it's a weaker oxidant. The second blank is 'faster' because in acidic, the reaction is faster.

Wait, looking at the question again: the statement says "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So, in basic, it's weaker. Then, kinetically, in acidic, it reacts faster.

So for the blanks, the first part is 'weaker' and the second is 'faster'. The options:

A) stronger – faster (no, first is stronger)
B) stronger – slower (no)
C) weaker – faster (yes, this matches)
D) weaker - slower (no)

So the correct option is C.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**:  
   The standard reduction potential of oxygen varies depending on the solution. In acidic solution, the reaction is:  
   $$\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}, \, E^\circ = +1.23 \, \text{V}.$$  
   In basic solution, the reaction is:  
   $$\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-, \, E^\circ = +0.401 \, \text{V}.$$  
   Since the standard reduction potential is higher in acidic solution, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions. Therefore, in basic solutions, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**:  
   Kinetic behavior depends on the reaction environment. In acidic solutions, the presence of $\text{H}^+$ ions can stabilize the transition state and reduce overpotential, making the reaction proceed faster. Conversely, in basic solutions, the higher pH and involvement of $\text{OH}^-$ ions can slow down the reaction. Thus, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

Combining these insights:  
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.  

From the given options:  
- **A)** stronger – faster (incorrect, as oxygen is weaker in basic solutions).  
- **B)** stronger – slower (incorrect, as oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions).  
- **C)** weaker – faster (correct, matches the analysis).  
- **D)** weaker – slower (incorrect, as oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions).  

Answer: C
