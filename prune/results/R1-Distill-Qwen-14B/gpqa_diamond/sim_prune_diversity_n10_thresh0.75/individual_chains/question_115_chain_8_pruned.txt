Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the problem again carefully.

The setup is this: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One goes upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, the first thing I remember is that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, the system's total momentum must be considered. Also, energy and momentum conservation are key here.

Wait, but wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass but opposite charges. So, their rest masses are the same. Oh, right, the rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is about 0.511 MeV. But since they're moving with different Lorentz factors, their relativistic energies will be different.

So, the first thing I should probably do is compute the total energy and momentum of both particles before they collide.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. Gamma = 4 for the electron (moving left to right?), and gamma = 2 for the positron (moving right to left? Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so direction-wise, it's towards the electron, right? So their velocities are opposite in direction.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is in the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. So their momenta would be opposite in sign?

Wait, no, actually, momentum is a vector. The electron's momentum is in the +x direction, and the positron's is in the -x direction. So when adding them, we subtract their magnitudes.

But let me calculate each particle's momentum and energy separately.

For the electron: gamma_e = 4. The rest mass of electron is m_e â‰ˆ 9.11e-31 kg.

Momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But alternatively, since p = gamma m v, and v =
