Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation for a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I'll need to break down the molecule into its constituent atoms and then use bond energies to calculate the overall enthalpy change.

Wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its atoms. So for carbon, that's the energy to break it into individual C atoms.

The molecule in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize or maybe draw the structure. Wait, maybe I can count the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Because to find the enthalpy of formation, I think the approach is to calculate the total energy of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed.

Wait no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is ΔHf° = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed). But wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Because when you form bonds, it's exothermic, so you subtract the energy of the bonds formed from the energy required to break the bonds in the elements.
