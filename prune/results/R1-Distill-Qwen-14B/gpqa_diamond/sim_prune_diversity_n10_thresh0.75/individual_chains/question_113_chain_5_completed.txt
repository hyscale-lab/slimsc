Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but sometimes alcohols can have broad peaks too. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. A peak around 1700 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, so that could be conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, maybe an amide? But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. So maybe two different carbonyl groups or one with conjugation. Wait, two peaks at 1700 and 1650, but 1700 is higher than 1650. Wait, that might suggest something like conjugated carbonyl groups, or maybe an enol form or something else. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have an alkene group. So the structure probably has a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think. 45 could be a (CH3)2O group, which is 15 + 30? Wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(15) + 16 = 46? Oh wait, wait. Let me calculate. (CH3)2O is (12*2 + 1*6) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So 45 isn't that. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group or something else. Wait, another possibility is that 45 corresponds to a -CH2CO- group, or maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. Let me think. 45 could be a three-carbon fragment, like a propyl group? Wait, propyl would be 45? No, propyl is 3 carbons, which would be 3*12 + 8 (for 3 H2's)= 44. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an aldehyde or ketone. Wait, another angle: the molecular formula is among the options, so perhaps I can figure that out first.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The molecular formula for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2)/2 = (14 -16)/2? Wait, wait, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

So that's one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees—could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14 -10 -2*2)/2= (14-10-4)/2=0/2=0? Wait no, wait the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, 2*6 +2=14; H=10, O=2 (but O doesn't affect DoU), so 14 -10 =4. 4/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14 -12)/2=2/2=1.

So the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond, so DoU should be at least 1. So options B, C, A, D all have at least 1 DoU except maybe not.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so there's an alkene in the structure, which is a DoU of 1. So the compound would have a double bond or a ring. But wait, if it's an aromatic ring, that's a higher DoU. But our options might not have that.

Wait, looking back, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Because in such a case, the carbonyl would be conjugated with the double bond, which could lower the carbonyl stretching frequency from 1700 to maybe 1680 or so. But our peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups, like an ester and a ketone or something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows two strong peaks in the 1700 and 1650 regions. If the compound is an ester, the carbonyl peak is typically around 1740-1700. If it's a ketone, maybe around 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone system (a conjugated ketone and double bond). Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 peak is from an amide, but since there's no nitrogen in the options, that's not possible. So perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group.

Now, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H stretch. So the compound has an -OH group, which would make sense for something like a carboxylic acid, ester (if it's an alkoxy group), or an alcohol.

Wait, but ester groups typically have a strong C=O around 1740 cm⁻¹. Wait no, the FTIR in the question shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. So if it's an ester, the C=O is usually higher, like around 1740. So maybe it's a ketone and something else. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 and 1650 peaks could be from two different carbonyl groups. For example, a cyclic ketone and another carbonyl? Hmm, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond (like an alkene's C=C). But then why two strong peaks?

Wait, the carbonyl peak in a conjugated system (like an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl) is usually lower than a non-conjugated one. So maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond, and the 1650 is the double bond's stretching. But then, the double bond's stretching in IR is usually around 1650. So that could align. So perhaps the compound has a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, such as an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone.

But wait, then the FTIR would show a carbonyl around 1700 and a C=C around 1650. That could be the case. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

So, putting this together, the compound has an -OH group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹), a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹), and a double bond (1650 cm⁻¹). So possible functional groups could be an alcohol and a ketone, but that would need to fit the molecular formula.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. That has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps an ester group (O in ester) and an -OH group. Or a ketone and an -OH.

Wait, but esters usually have a carbonyl around 1740, so the 1700 peak might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that could explain the NMR with vinyl protons.

Carboxylic acids have the formula RCOOH. So the molecular formula would end with COOH, which is CxHyO2. Let's check the options. Option C is C6H10O2. That fits the carboxylic acid part (needs two O's) and maybe a double bond.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see if that makes sense. The molecular formula would be, say, CH2CH2COOH plus something else? Wait, but let's think about the molecular weight. Wait, perhaps it's something like CH2=CHCOOH (but that's only three carbons). So perhaps a larger molecule, like CH2CH2 group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, maybe the fragment could be from the loss of COOH. But that would be much higher than 45. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 could correspond to a propyl group. Wait, no, m/z=45 is for a charged species. Let me think about possible fragments. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone fragment. Let's think of possible structures.

Another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option and see which fit the data.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a formula with a double bond (DoU=2). So maybe it's a diene and a carbonyl group, but wait, the IR only has one carbonyl peak. Hmm. Or perhaps it's an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, but the IR has a broad peak, suggesting an -OH. So maybe an alcohol with a carbonyl. For example, a ketone and an alcohol.

But the O count would need to be right. So if the formula is C6H10O, O is one. So maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol? But that would require two O atoms, which is not the case here. Hmm, maybe an allylic alcohol with a carbonyl.

Wait, but the O is only one. So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ether with a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde and an alcohol. But aldehydes have a C=O, and an alcohol. But then O would be two, which doesn't fit option B.

So maybe option B isn't the right one.

Option D is C6H12O. DoU=1. So maybe a ring or a double bond. Since the NMR shows vinyl protons, a double bond. So D would fit a structure with a double bond and perhaps an O-containing group. Like a diol or an alcohol with a double bond. But the IR shows a broad peak, which would be -OH. So maybe a diol, but the O count is only one. So perhaps a mono-alcohol with a double bond.

But then, the IR has two carbonyl peaks. Wait, that's a problem. Because an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl. So the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 wouldn't make sense. So that would rule out option D.

So options A and C are left.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have a double bond and an O2. So perhaps an ester or a ketone and an -OH. Wait, but the IR peaks would have to fit.

Ester: C=O around 1740, but the IR here is 1700. So maybe a conjugated ester? Or a ketone. Let me see.

If the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone), that would have an ester group. The carbonyl would be around 1700. Then the IR would have a broad peak for the alcohol, but wait, lactones are cyclic esters, and they don't have an -OH group. Because in the lactone, the -OH is part of the ring. Wait, no, in a lactone, the ester functional group is formed by an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, but the ring structure doesn't have an -OH group. So the broad peak might not fit. Unless the molecule is a diol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and a carboxylic acid. Wait, but that would require two oxygen-containing groups. So that could fit option C (C6H10O2), which has two oxygen atoms.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So two degrees, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring, etc.

If it's a carboxylic acid, then it has the formula RCOOH. So that takes two O's. Then, the rest of the structure would need to account for four carbons (since R would be C5H9?), but wait, wait, let me count. The formula is C6H10O2. RCOOH has (n) carbons in R plus 2 (COOH), so R would be C4H9, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOH. That would be C3H4O2. But the molecular formula in question is C6H10O2. So we'd have three more carbons and six more hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted or more complex structure. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, but that would be ester, which would have a higher O count. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentene ring with a carboxylic acid group. Let's see: cyclopentene has 5 carbons, and adding a carboxylic acid would make 6. So the structure would be cyclopentene with a COOH group attached. Then the formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclopentene is C5H8, and COOH is COOH, which adds two O and two H (since it's RCOOH: R is C5H7, so COOH would be O2 and H2, so total formula is C6H8O2. Wait, that's not matching option C, which is C6H10O2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's get back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z=45. What structures have a fragment of 45?

45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO (acetone is 58, no, wait: acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, wait, wait: 12*3 (for three carbons) + 6*1 (six hydrogens) + 16 (O) = 36 +6 +16=58. So 45 isn't acetone. Wait, 45 could be CH3COO- (45?), but wait: CH3COO- is 45? Let's calculate: CH3COO- is (12*2 + 1*4 +16) = 24 +4 +16=44. Oh, so that's 44. So maybe the fragment is CH3COOH (acetic acid is 60, but that's with a proton). Hmm.

Alternatively, m/z=45 could be a fragment like CH2CH2O, but that's 44. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group (formaldehyde has a molecular weight of 30, but a fragment could be something else). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the tropylium ion, which is C7H7+, but that's 91. No, that's not matching 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2CHO group. Let's see: CH2CHO would have a molecular weight of CH2CHO= (12*3)+(1*5)+16 = 36+5+16=57. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? CH2CH2O would be C2H4O, which is 44 (2*12 =24, 4=4, 16=16; 24+4+16=44). So maybe the fragment is C2H4O, which is 44. But the mass spectrum shows a peak at 45. Hmm, close but not exact. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of something. For example, in an ester, the loss of R-O- group could leave a fragment. Or in a ketone, perhaps cleavage occurs.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which is about 40% of the molecular weight. So perhaps it's a cleavage product, like the loss of a larger fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from a small fragment, like a ketene or something else.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures again. The compound has an -OH (broad peak), a carbonyl (1700 and 1650), and a double bond (vinyl protons). So maybe it's a dienol or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an -OH group. Wait, but that would require two oxygen atoms. So, for option C (C6H10O2), the structure could be something like cyclopentanone with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but cyclopentanone is C5H8O. Adding a hydroxyl would make it C5H8O2. But our formula is C6H10O2, which has one more carbon and two more hydrogens. So perhaps cyclohexanone with an -OH group. But cyclohexanone is C6H10O. Adding an -OH would make C6H10O2. So that's option C. Then the structure would be cyclohexanol with a ketone? Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone is (CH2)5CO. If there's an -OH on the ring, that would be a cyclohexanol derivative. But a ketone and an alcohol on the same ring? That would require two oxygen atoms, which fits.

But wait, the FTIR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. A ketone is around 1700, but where would the 1650 come from? Maybe the ring's C=C, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, it's a cyclic ketone. Oh wait, but if the ring is unsaturated, like cyclohexene, but that's not the same as a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexenone. So a six-membered ring with both a double bond and a ketone. For instance, cyclohexenone has a structure where one of the ring carbons is double-bonded to another and has a ketone group. So the structure would have a conjugated double bond and ketone. So the IR would show the ketone at 1700, and perhaps the double bond's C=C around 1650. That would fit the IR data. Then, the NMR would show vinyl protons on the double bond. So that would fit.

But then, what about the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹? That suggests an -OH group. So the structure would have a cyclohexenone ring (C6H8O) plus an -OH, making C6H8O2. But the molecular formula in option C is C6H10O2. That doesn't match, because cyclohexenone with an -OH would be C6H8O2. So that adds 2 more hydrogens. Hmm, maybe the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexenone with two substituents. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the mass spectrum. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. The fragment at 45 would be a third of that. So perhaps it's a cleavage product. For example, in an ester, the molecule could break into two parts. If the structure is an ester, like RCOOR', then the loss of R' could leave the RCOO- group, which is 45? Let me calculate RCOO- for a certain R.

If RCOO- is 45, then RCOO- has a mass of 45. RCOO- is (R's molecular weight + 45 - R's weight). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion, which has the formula (CH3)2CO+ at m/z=58, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a smaller acid. Let's say the structure is CH2=CHCOOH ( acrylic acid ), which has a molecular weight of 72. But then a fragment at 45 would make sense if it's the CH2CH2COOH losing something. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ester. Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's an ester with a vinyl group. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is (3 carbons in the acid part) + (2 carbons in the alcohol part) => 5 carbons? No, wait, wait: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so CH2=CHCOO would be R, and the R' is CH2CH3. So the formula would be C5H8O2 (from CH2=CHCOO) plus C2H5 (as R'), which would make C7H13O2. But that's not matching our options. So that's not the right structure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

Looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation=2. So either a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Since the NMR shows vinyl protons, the structure must have a double bond. So, for option A, which has DoU=1, that double bond would account for that. But if the structure also has a ring, that would require another DoU, which isn't the case. So that can't be.

Wait, no. DoU counts each ring and each double bond as one. So if a compound has a double bond and a ring, that's two DoU. So option A has one DoU, so it must have either a double bond or a ring, but not both.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so it must have a double bond. So for option A, the structure has a double bond (DoU=1), so no rings. So the structure is an open-chain compound with a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but then the IR has two peaks in the 1700 and 1650 regions. Let me think.

If the structure is an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740, but our IR shows 1700. So perhaps it's a conjugated ester? Or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, which would have a carbonyl around 1700 and a C=C around 1650.

So for option A, C6H12O2, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's too long. Or perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But lactones don't have an -OH group, so the broad peak wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond. So the structure has an ester group (so O in ester), a double bond (from vinyl protons), and an -OH group (for the broad peak). Wait, but that would require three oxygen atoms, which none of the options have.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If option A is C6H12O2, and the structure has an ester group (O from ester) and a hydroxyl group (O from -OH), that would require two O's, which fits. But then the structure would have both an ester and an -OH, which is possible.

So, for example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2OH. Wait, but that's a diol ester or something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acrylic acid ester. I'm not sure.

Another approach: considering the IR and NMR.

The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an -OH (like an alcohol or carboxylic acid). The two carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be a conjugated system, like an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So the structure could be a dienone (two conjugated carbonyls?), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with a double bond and an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the presence of two carbonyl peaks suggests two different carbonyl groups, or one with a shift due to conjugation.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could have both a ketone and an ester group, leading to two carbonyl peaks. But that would require more O's than some options.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the carbonyls is an aromatic ring, but it's unclear.

Another thought: the two IR peaks (1700 and 1650) could be due to an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, such as in an aromatic ketone. For example, acetophenone has a carbonyl around 1700, and the aromatic ring's C=C around 1600. But 1650 is a bit higher than that, so maybe it's an ortho-substituted aromatic ketone, which could cause some shifts.

But the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR suggests an alkene, not an aromatic ring. So perhaps it's an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, as I thought earlier.

So, for example, a structure like (E)- or (Z)-CH2CHCOCH2CH2OH. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, considering the mass spectrum again. If the fragment is 45, which is a third of the molecular weight (if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114; 45 is roughly a third), perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group (which is 44) plus a proton, making 45. Or perhaps the fragment is a methyl ester group or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the parent compound is a diethyl acetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the m/z=45 as (CH3)2O (45 would be 45. So (CH3)2O is 46. So no, that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the molecule is an ester where the R group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- or something, and the fragment is the smaller part. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but that's getting complicated.

Let me try to think of each option's possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So the structure could have a double bond and a ring. For example, a cyclopentene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl and an -OH.

Wait, another possibility: a substituted cyclopentanone with a vinyl group and an -OH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted acrylic acid, like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's only three carbons. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which is an ester. Let me check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Yes! Because CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. Wait, no, the ester would be RCOOR', so R is CH2CHCO (3 carbons), R' is CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons). So the ester would be C3H5COO C3H7. Wait, not sure about the exact formula, but maybe the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

But wait, the structure CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would have the formula C6H10O2. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons (CH2-CH-COO-), and the R' is CH2CH2CH3 (3 carbons). So total 6 carbons. Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 5 hydrogens (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO has 2? Wait, no. CH2=CHCOO- would have the structure CH2=CH-C-O-O-. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so R would be CH2CH2COO-? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to write the structure as CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

Breaking it down:

CH2=CHCOO: that's 3 carbons (CH2, CH, COO). The R' is CH2CH2CH3: 3 carbons. So total 6.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 5 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO has 2? Wait, the COO group in an ester is O-C-O, so the structure is CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3. The CH2=CHCO-O- part: the CH2 group has 2 H, the CH group has 1 H, the COO has no H (since it's an ester). The R' is CH2CH2CH3 (which has 7 H, but in the ester, the O connects to CH2CH2CH3, so the R' is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H). So total H: 2 (from CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 7 (from R') = 10. So molecular formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So the structure would be an ester, with a vinyl group (CH2=CHCOO-) and an R' group (CH2CH2CH3). The ester functional group would have a carbonyl at around 1740, but the FTIR in the question shows a peak at 1700, which is lower. So perhaps the conjugation with the double bond lowers the carbonyl's stretching frequency.

Also, the presence of vinyl protons in the NMR would make sense because of the CH2=CHCOO group.

What about the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹? Wait, the structure I'm thinking of (the ester) doesn't have an -OH group. So the broad peak wouldn't fit unless there's another functional group with an -OH. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't an ester but a different compound. For example, a ketone with a hydroxyl group and a double bond.

Another approach: if the structure has a conjugated carbonyl and double bond, like an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, and an -OH group.

So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCO-OH (but that's not correct, because then it would be a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond. Wait, CH2=CHCOOH is acrylic acid, which has a formula of C3H4O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, so perhaps it's a substituted version.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol with a ketone and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which could be from an alcohol. So the structure has an -OH group. The two carbonyl peaks could be from a conjugated system, like an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-R. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's probably more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a dienol. Diensols have conjugated double bonds and hydroxyl groups. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a molecule with both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. For example, a diketone with a carboxylic acid, but that would require more O's.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the mass spectrum again. If the fragment is at 45, which is a small mass, perhaps it's a common fragment like a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group, which is 45 (CH3COO has a mass of 45? Let me calculate: 12*2 + 1*4 +16*2=24+4+32=60. No, that's not right. Wait, CH3COO- is 59? No, CH3COO- is 45? Wait, the formula is C2H3O2^-? That can't be. Wait, perhaps it's the tropylium ion, but that's 91.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a ketone ion. For example, a (CH3)2CO+ ion is 58 (acetone's molecular ion). But the fragment is 45, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a formate ion (HCOO^-), which has a mass of 45. HCOO- is (1+12 + 16*2)= 1+12+32=45. So yes, the formate ion would be m/z=45.

So, if the parent compound has a formate group, then the fragment would be HCOO-.

But the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the formate is part of the structure, perhaps the parent is something like (CH2)4CH2-O-CO-OH. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the parent compound is a substituted acetic acid. For example, CH2=CHCH2COOH. That's C5H8O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, so perhaps it's a hexenoic acid derivative. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, the parent compound loses a (CH2)3CH2 group, leaving a fragment of 45. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. This could be an ester with a double bond. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So the ester would be C3H4O2 + C3H7 => C6 H11 O2. But option A is C6H12O2. So that's one more H. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Then the formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, but that's option C. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's say it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be C3H4O2 (from CH2=CHCOO-) plus C3H7 (from CH2CH2CH3), but that adds up to C6H11O2. But the formula is C6H10O2. So that doesn't fit. Perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol ester or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures for each option and see which one fits all the data.

Option C: C6H10O2. Suppose the structure is an ester with a vinyl group and a hydroxyl group elsewhere. Wait, but that would require three O's, which is not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH group. But cyclic esters are lactones and don't have -OH groups.

Another thought: the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks, which could be two carbonyl groups. For example, an ester and a ketone. But that would require more O's. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester and the other is a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the two carbonyl peaks are from an ester and an alkyne (C≡O). But that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the ester's carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated C=C is around 1650.

In that case, the structure would have an ester group (O's accounted for) and a double bond. Plus, where is the -OH group coming from? Because the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an -OH, so the structure must have that.

Wait, maybe the structure is a hydroxyl-substituted alpha-beta unsaturated ester. For example, CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2OH. But that would have the formula C6H10O3, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures for each option and see which one fits all the data.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's assume it's an ester with a vinyl group. Then, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an alkyl group. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So total is C6H11O2. But option C is C6H10O2, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe R is a shorter chain. For example, R is CH2CH2. So the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That's C5H8O2. So that's not matching the formula. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH group. But that's possible only if the ring has an -OH attached, which would require more O's, but the option has two O's.

Another angle: let's think about the mass spectrum. If the fragment is 45, which is a common fragment for (CH3)COO- (propanoate ion, 45), but wait, propanoate is C2H5O2^-.

Wait, (CH3)COO^- is 59? No, let me calculate. CH3COO- is 12*2 +1*4 +16*2=24+4+32=60. So that's 60, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, if the fragment is CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is 60, but the fragment is 45, so that's not it.

Alternatively, if the fragment is (CH3)2O, which is 46, but the fragment is 45, which is off by one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, (CH2)2C=O, which is 45. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think of the molecular formula of each option and possible structures.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So either a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's a ring and a double bond, the structure could be a cyclopentene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl and an -OH. For example, cyclopentene with a substituent like -COOH.

Wait, cyclopentene is C5H8. Adding a -COOH group would make it C6H8O2. But option C is C6H10O2. So two more hydrogens. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOH group. So the structure would be cyclopentene with a -CH2COOH substituent. The formula would be C5H8 + C2H4O2 = C7H12O2. No, that's not matching.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should make a table of each option and see which fits.

Option | Formula | DoU | Possible Structure
A | C6H12O2 | 1 | Could be an ester with a double bond (no ring)
B | C6H10O | 2 | Maybe a diene and an -OH
C | C6H10O2 | 2 | Maybe an ester with a double bond and an -OH
D | C6H12O | 1 | Maybe a diol with a double bond

The IR shows a broad peak (OH), two carbonyls (so O's involved), and a double bond (vinyl protons).

Option A: DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. Since the structure has a double bond (from NMR), the ring isn't present. So the structure has a double bond and two oxygen-containing groups. So maybe an ester (which has O) and a hydroxyl group. But the IR for ester's carbonyl is usually higher than 1700. However, if it's conjugated, it could be lower. So perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group.

But wait, that would require three O's, which isn't the case for option A (two O's). So that's not possible.

Option B: C6H10O. It has one O, so the structure must have one O-containing group. Since the IR shows an -OH (broad peak) and two carbonyls, which is impossible with one O. So option B is ruled out.

Option D: C6H12O. One O. So again, can't have two carbonyls. So D is ruled out.

So, the only possible options left are A and C.

Between A and C, option C has two O's, so an ester and an -OH can't fit because that would require three O's. So perhaps option C has a ketone and a carboxylic acid, which would require two O's.

Wait, if the structure is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond and a ketone, that would have two O's. Hmm, but that's two O's in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an -OH group and a double bond.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the Mass Spec again. The fragment is 45, which corresponds to a formate ion (HCOO^-). So the parent compound might have a formyl group (HCO-) somewhere, but that's in a larger structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent compound has a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which could fragment into a smaller ion.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is 6 carbons. Suppose the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group and an -OH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl maleate or something similar. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows two carbonyl peaks. One at 1700 (possibly an ester or ketone) and another at 1650 (possibly an aromatic ring or conjugated double bond). Since the NMR has vinyl protons, it's a double bond, not an aromatic ring. So the 1650 peak is the C=C. So the 1700 peak is a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

So the structure must have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. For example, an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is an alkyl group.

If R is CH2CH2CH3, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The formula for CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So total would be C6H11O2. But option C is C6H10O2, so that's one H too many. So perhaps R is shorter.

If R is CH3, then the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But the option is C6H10O2, so not matching.

Alternatively, R is CH2CH2, but that would make the ester formula C5H10O2, which still doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't an ester but a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is a diketone with a double bond and an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal with a double bond. But I'm not certain.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the data:

- The presence of vinyl protons suggests a double bond.

- The IR shows an -OH (broad peak), two carbonyls (1700 and 1650), which suggests conjugated carbonyl and double bond.

- The molecular formula must have two O's, which fits options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So a double bond. But the IR has two carbonyl peaks, which suggests two different carbonyl groups or a conjugated one. So perhaps an ester and a conjugated double bond. But esters have higher carbonyl frequencies. So maybe a conjugated ketone and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds. The IR suggests a conjugated system (C=C and C=O), so perhaps two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Given that, I think option C is more likely because the DoU=2 could accommodate both a double bond and another group, like a ring. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the mass spectrum again. If the fragment is at 45, which is formate ion, then the parent must have a formyl group. So perhaps the structure is a formate ester. For example, HCOOR, where R is C5H9. Then the formula would be C6H12O2, which matches option A (C6H12O2).

But wait, HCO-O-R would be an ester, and the formula would be C6H12O2.

So structure could be HCO-O-R, where R is C5H11. But that doesn't explain the double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HCO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's seven carbons. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha-hydroxy ester with a double bond.

But I'm not getting anywhere. I think I'll have to make a decision based on the data.

Considering all the data:

- FTIR: -OH (broad), C=O (1700), C=C (1650).

- 1H NMR: vinyl protons.

- Mass Spec: fragment at 45.

The structure must have an -OH, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. The molecular formula must be among the options.

Option C: C6H10O2. That fits the DoU=2, allowing for a double bond and a ring (but I'm not sure about the ring).

But without a clear structure, I'll have to go with the data that best fits.

The fragment at 45 could be from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the parent is an ester with a larger R group, losing part of it could leave a fragment of 45.

Alternatively, the structure could be a diethyl ester of a substituted acrylic acid. But I'm not certain.

Given all that, I think the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on FTIR, $^1$H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The analysis of the data is as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - Two strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of carbonyl groups. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O), while the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated system, such as a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond (C=C).

2. **$^1$H NMR Spectrum**:
   - The presence of **peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens** confirms the presence of a double bond (C=C).

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This is consistent with a **formate ion (HCOO⁻)**, which has a mass of 45.

4. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - The options provided are:
     - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**
     - **B) C₆H₁₀O**
     - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**
     - **D) C₆H₁₂O**

   Using the formula for degrees of unsaturation (DoU):
   - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1 (one degree of unsaturation, likely a double bond or a ring).
   - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2 (two degrees of unsaturation, such as a double bond and a ring or two double bonds).
   - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2 (two degrees of unsaturation, such as a double bond and a ring or two double bonds).
   - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1 (one degree of unsaturation, likely a double bond or a ring).

### Elimination of Options:
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula contains only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for the two carbonyl peaks observed in the IR spectrum. Thus, this option is ruled out.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Similar to Option B, this formula also contains only one oxygen atom, making it unable to explain the two carbonyl peaks in the IR spectrum. This option is also ruled out.
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for the double bond and the conjugated system implied by the IR and NMR data. Thus, this option is ruled out.

### Conclusion:
The only remaining option is **C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**, which has two degrees of unsaturation. This allows for the presence of both a double bond and a ring or two double bonds. The IR data (broad -OH peak, carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹) and the NMR data (vinyl hydrogens) are consistent with this formula. Additionally, the fragment peak at m/z = 45 aligns with the formate ion, supporting the presence of a carbonyl group in the structure.

**Answer: C**
