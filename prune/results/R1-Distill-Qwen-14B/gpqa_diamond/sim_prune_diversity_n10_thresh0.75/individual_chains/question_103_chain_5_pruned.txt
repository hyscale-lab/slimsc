Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break that down. It's a phenyl group attached to a ketone. The phenyl ring has substituents: a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. So the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions of the benzene ring, and the ketone is attached at the 1-position, which I think is the same as the para position when considering the substituents.

Wait, no. Wait, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (ethan-1-one means the carbonyl is at position 1?), and then at positions 3 and 5 are the bromine and nitro groups. So the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Hmm, benzene rings can be a bit confusing with their numbering. Let me visualize this. Imagine the ketone is on position 1. Then, position 3 would be two carbons away in one direction, and position 5 would be two in the other. So the substituents are at 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro) relative to the ketone.

Wait, but maybe I should think of this differently. Let's number the benzene ring such that the ketone is at position 1. Then, the positions 3 and 5 are the meta positions relative to the ketone. So, the bromine is at position 3 and nitro at position 5, or vice versa. It's possible, but I'm not entirely sure about the numbering. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene relative to each other, but that's getting a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of directing groups. The ketone is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which is a meta director. The nitro
