Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the decay of a boson X. The problem gives me the interaction Lagrangian, which is some equation involving fermions and the boson X. Oh, right, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian determines the interactions between particles.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to think about which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f f ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me look again. Oh, right, the formula is probably something like L = -λ ψ̄ X ψ, meaning that the boson X interacts with the fermion ψ. So X can decay into ψ and ψ̄ if the energy allows.

But wait, the way the Lagrangian is written, it's -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I need to parse that more carefully. So the X field is interacting with the fermions. It seems like X is a scalar boson because the interaction term is something
