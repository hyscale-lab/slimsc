Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with the first reaction:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+ to give product A.

I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. So, maybe this is a deprotonation reaction. In such conditions, especially with a base, I think about elimination or maybe some kind of cyclization since the starting material is a spiro compound.

Looking at the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure is a 5-membered and a 3-membered ring? Wait, no, the spiro is [3.5], so one ring is 3 carbons (but wait, no, the spiro notation is [n.m], where n and m are the number of carbons in each ring, not including the spiro atom). So, for spiro[3.5], the rings are 3+1+5-1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the spiro atom is the bridge between two rings, one being three carbons (like cyclopropane?) and the other five?

Wait, no. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. So, spiro[3.5]non would mean the molecule is a 9-carbon structure with two rings: one of three carbons and another of five carbons, sharing the spiro atom. But the exact structure might not matter as much as the reaction outcome.

In any case, the starting alcohol has an -OH group attached to a double bond (since there's a 'en' in the name, indicating a double bond). So, the structure is something like:

CH2=CH-O-C (some ring structure) 

Wait, no, perhaps the spiro structure is more like:

Imagine two rings connected at one carbon. The spiro[3.5]non would have two rings: a three-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a five-membered ring, connected at a single carbon. The 1-position is where the vinyl group is attached â€” so the -OH is on the same carbon as the double bond.

So, the structure is a bicyclic compound with a spiro junction. The presence of a double bond (non-5-en) suggests that the main chain has a double bond at position 5.

When treated with a strong base like KH in THF, which is a deprotonating agent, what happens? Well, the alcohol is acidic because it's adjacent to a double bond, maybe. The OH would be deprotonated to form an alkoxide.

Wait, but the starting alcohol is a secondary or tertiary one. The structure is a spiro alcohol, so the OH is attached to a bridge
