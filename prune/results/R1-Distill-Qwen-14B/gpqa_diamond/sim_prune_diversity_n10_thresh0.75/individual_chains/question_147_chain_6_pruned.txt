Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait. The particles are a proton and an antiproton annihilating each other. The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Oh, right, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, but in annihilation processes, I think the initial particles are usually moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta if they're in a collider setup. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, maybe that's a clue about the energy available.

The given mass of A is mA c² = 300 MeV. And the question is about finding the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so we'll have to find beta (β = v/c) probably.

So, first, I think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is low. Wait, but when a proton and antiproton annihilate, the rest mass of each is about 938 MeV/c² each. So the total rest mass is about 1876 MeV. But the products are four particles, each with mass 300 MeV. So 4
