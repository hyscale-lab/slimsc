Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me try to break down the information step by step.

First, the IR data. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 probably indicate N-H stretching because those wavenumbers are typical for amide or amine groups. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group. Hmm, so maybe an amide or an ester or something with a carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's parse each peak:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, which usually suggests a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2. Like an ethyl group, maybe the CH3 of -CH2CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be from things like NH groups or perhaps some exchange, but in this case, it's 2H. Maybe an ethyl ester's oxygenated CH2? Or maybe an OCH2 group. But the integration is 2H, which could fit.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. That's a classic ethyl group's CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe OCH2CH2O or something like that. Wait, but in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the O would be a triplet, but the splitting depends. Alternatively, maybe an ester group where the CH2 is attached to an oxygen. Like in ethyl esters where the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet for the CH2 near the oxygen.

Wait, no, wait. For ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would have the CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2 ppm, which matches the first peak. The adjacent CH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. Oh, wait, in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Maybe that's from something else.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the splitting. The quartet at 4.5 for 2
