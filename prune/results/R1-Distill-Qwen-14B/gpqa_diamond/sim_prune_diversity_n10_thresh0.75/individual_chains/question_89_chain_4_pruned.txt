Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a very rigid structure. So, 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, probably adjacent ones.

Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base. I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a strong base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, the product here, product 1, would be 1,3-adamantadiene, but wait, let me think. Because the starting dihalide is 1,3, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. So when KOH removes H from each adjacent to Br, but wait, wait, no, in elimination, the H is removed from a carbon adjacent to each Br. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Hmm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons? Because in adamantane, the bridgehead positions are all connected in a way that each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. Wait, no, adamantane is more like a diamond structure. Wait, maybe the structure is such that the two Brs are on carbons that, when eliminated, form a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, perhaps the structure is such that elimination of two HBr molecules leads to the formation of a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 are two carbons apart. So elimination would form a diene? Or perhaps a single double bond?

Wait, but let's think about the product. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79
