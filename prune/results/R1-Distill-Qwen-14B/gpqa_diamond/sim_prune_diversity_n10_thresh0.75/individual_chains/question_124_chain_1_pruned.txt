Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is saying.

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. Their average Lorentz factor is about 20. The detector's radius is 30 meters. 

The first situation says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. But the question is asking, what Lorentz factor do we need so that about two-thirds (so twice as much) of the particles reach the walls?

Wait, okay, so the original scenario has a Lorentz factor gamma of 20, and only 1/3 make it. We need gamma such that 2/3 make it. I think it has to do with the lifetime of the particles and how far they travel before decaying.

Right, because particles that decay earlier won't reach the detector walls. So the ones that live longer (higher gamma) have a higher chance of reaching the walls. But how does gamma relate to the distance they travel?

I remember that the proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. The dilated lifetime (t) in the lab frame is gamma times tau. So t = gamma * tau.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is v times t. Since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D is approximately c * t = c * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, the maximum possible distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, R. So for a particle to reach the detector wall, its lifetime must be such that the distance it travels is at least R.

Hmm, but in the first case, with gamma1=20, one third make it. That means that the lifetime is such that a third of the particles have a gamma that allows them to reach the wall.

Wait, no. Wait, the particles are produced, and each particle has a certain proper lifetime. The ones that live longer (higher gamma) will have a longer path length. But I think the problem is assuming all particles have the same proper lifetime, but different gamma factors. So the question is about how the fraction relates to gamma.

Wait no, wait. Wait, in the first scenario, the particles have a gamma of 20, and on average, 1/3 reach the wall. So for each particle, the probability that it decays after traveling a distance greater than R is 1/3. So the probability is related to gamma.

Wait, perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before traveling distance D is 1 - exp(-D/(c tau)), where D is the distance traveled. So the probability that it reaches the detector (distance D is R) is exp(-R/(c tau)).

Wait, wait, the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)), and since time t = D/(c), when D is the distance. So the probability of decay after time t is exp(-t/(tau)), but wait, no, the survival probability is exp(-t/(tau)). So the probability that the particle hasn
