Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, the question gives a lot of parameters, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio, which is good.

The formula I recall is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), but since A is the same for both planets, the (1-A) part will cancel when taking the ratio. So when I take the ratio of T1 to T2, the (1-A) terms will just be squared, but since they're same, it's 1.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 * a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4}

So since A is the same, the (1-A) term will be (1 - A)^(1/4) for each planet, but when we take the ratio T1/T2, it should be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) * ( (1 - A)^{1/4} / (1 - A)^{1/4} ) )

Oh wait, the (1 - A) terms cancel because they are the same for both. So the ratio simplifies to sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) 

Which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1), because R_star and 2 are common in both numerator and denominator. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let's make it precise.

The ratio T1/T2 would be:

sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) )

= sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) * (2a2/R_star) ) )

= sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) )

So yes, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is square root of (a
