Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about NMR spectroscopy, some reactions, and identifying a compound. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question starts with Compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others. Wait, no—actually, the splitting is based on neighboring protons. So a triplet has two neighboring protons, right? Like if you have two adjacent protons, that would split into a triplet. So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, 6H—this makes me think of something like a methyl group next to another CH2 group or something. Because methyl groups (CH3) have three protons, so maybe two methyl groups adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, no, the triplet is for 6H. So that would be six protons in total. If it's a triplet, each of these protons is next to two others. Like if it's a CH2CH2CH3 structure? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's two equivalent CH2 groups next to a CH3. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Like CH2CH2, but that doesn't add up. Or perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)2 structure. No, wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group or something similar.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is adjacent to three others. So maybe a CH2 group next to a CH3. Because each of the CH2 protons would be next to three CH3 protons, leading to a quartet. Or wait, wait. A quartet arises when a proton is next to a CH2 group. Because each CH2 has two protons, so splitting into a triplet? Or wait, let me think again. The splitting is governed by the number of neighboring protons. So a quartet (n=3) would mean the proton is adjacent to a group with three protons. So like
