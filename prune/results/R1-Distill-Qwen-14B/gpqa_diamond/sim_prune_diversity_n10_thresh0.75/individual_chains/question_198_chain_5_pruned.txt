Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in determining the predominant form of a complex in solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, but wait, wait. The options are about the blue ones, which I believe are the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complexes. So, we're looking for the concentration of the complex with two SCN- ligands.

Stability constants, right. The stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For each step, you multiply the previous β. Wait, or is each β for a specific complex? Let me clarify.

The complexes are likely Co(SCN)n^(2-n) or something like that. The stability constants are given for each successive complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, and so on. Or wait, maybe each β is for the nth complex. So β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Wait, but in the question, the blue dithiocyanato complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, right? So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^+. So the relevant β here is β2, which is 40.

But wait, no. Because each β is the formation constant for each step. Wait, no, if the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc., perhaps each β represents the formation of the complex with n ligands. Wait, no, I think each β is an overall constant for each successive complex. So for each level, you have a different β. So, for [Co(SCN
