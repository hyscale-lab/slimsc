Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are involved in electromagnetism, particularly scalar and vector potentials. Let me think through this.

The question says that there's a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at the generating time tr is v.

I need to find the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, t is after the event when the charge was at some position, and the fields generated then are what's being observed now.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a point charge is usually given by Coulomb's law, but when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh right, because when charges move, they create magnetic fields too, so we need to consider both electric and magnetic potentials.

The scalar potential V is related to the electric field, right? The electric field E is the negative gradient of V. Then there's the vector potential A, which is linked to the magnetic field B via the curl of A.

I recall that for a moving charge, the scalar potential might involve the velocity. But wait, wait. In the rest frame of the charge, the scalar potential is just Coulomb's potential, but when you boost to another frame, things change. Or maybe another approach: the potentials should account for the fact that the charge was moving when it generated the field.

Wait, the problem gives me that the velocity at the generating time is v. So that's the velocity at the time when the fields (or potentials) were emitted. So the potentials at time t, which is after tr, are due to the charge's position and velocity at tr.

So, the scalar potential V would depend on the charge's position at tr, but the vector potential would involve its velocity there.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is something like V = (q/(4πε0)) * (1/(r')) where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r, but adjusted for the fact that the charge was moving. Or maybe it's
