Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let me break down the information given.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can tell us about the structure. A triplet with 6H suggests maybe two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Like maybe two methyl groups each split into a triplet. And a quartet with 4H could imply another set of equivalent protons, perhaps two CH2 groups adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, when you have a triplet for 6H, that's probably two methyl groups next to a CH2. Because each CH3 in a di-substituted environment might split into a triplet. Like, maybe (CH2CH3)2CH2 or something. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a neopentyl structure, but that would have different splitting.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 might be from two methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. For example, if you have (CH2CH3)2CH2, but wait, that would be a (CH3CH2)2CH2 structure, but that doesn't quite fit. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2 something? Or maybe it's a diethyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal di-substitution. Hmm, perhaps it's a (CH2CH3) group adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (which is a low ppm, so likely a CH3 group) with 6H. A triplet would mean each of those protons is next to two equivalent protons. So, maybe each CH3 is attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. For instance, if we have a structure like CH2CH2CH3 attached to something else. Wait, perhaps a diethyl group. Like (CH2CH2CH3)2CH something? No, wait, diethyl would be (CH2CH3)2CH2. Wait, but that would give the CH2 group adjacent to two CH2CH3 groups. Let me draw it.

Imagine a central CH2 group connected to two ethyl groups. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH3 attached to another CH2CH2CH3 via a central CH2. Wait, no, that would make the central CH2 connected to two CH2CH3 groups. So the structure would be (CH2CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, the structure would be CH2CH2CH3-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH3 connected to another CH2CH2CH3 via a CH2 group. So, maybe it's CH2CH2CH3-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that would make the central CH2 between two ethyl groups. Let me think about the NMR again.

In that structure, each ethyl group would have a triplet for their CH3. Because each CH3 is next to a CH2, which is next to another CH2 group. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about coupling. The CH3 groups in an ethyl group are next to a CH2. The CH2 in the middle would have neighboring CH2 groups from the two ethyl groups. So, the central CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups, which might make it a quartet or something else.

Wait, in the given NMR, the triplet is 6H (so two CH3 groups, each integrating to 3H), and the quartet is 4H, which is two CH2 groups, each integrating
