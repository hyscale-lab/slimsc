Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. An organic chemist did two reactions, and I need to figure out how many peaks appear in the HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It usually reduces ketones. So the starting material is a ketone. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one's structure is a hexane chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The configuration is S, which probably doesn't matter for the reaction since LAH is a strong reducing agent.

Reducing a ketone would give a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the position of the carbonyl becomes an alcohol. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol. And the substituents are same; the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is (S) configuration, but wait, the reduction might affect the stereochemistry. Oh wait, no, LAH is a strong reducing agent but for ketones, it's a simple two-electron reduction. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the starting material? Or is it racemic?

Wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is an (S) configuration. But when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the adjacent chiral center might change. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The ketone is at carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, more accurately, the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-something. Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let me see: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the chain is six carbons. Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. Carbon 5 has the methoxy. So structure is CH2CH2
