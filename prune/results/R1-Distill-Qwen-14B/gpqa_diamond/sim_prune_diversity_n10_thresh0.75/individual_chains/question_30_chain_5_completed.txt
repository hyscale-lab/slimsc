Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Oh right, conjugated pi systems are usually involved in absorbing certain wavelengths of light because of the way the electrons get excited.

Wait, the energy given is 2.3393 eV. I think I need to relate that to the wavelength of light to find out the color. Oh yeah, the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ. Let me get the values right. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J*s, and the speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, I also remember that sometimes it's easier to use eV and wavelength directly with a conversion.

Oh right, there's a shortcut. I think 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm. So if I have 2.3393 eV, the wavelength λ would be 1240 / 2.3393. Let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393... Hmm, 2.3393 times 500 is approximately 1169.65, which is close to 1240. So maybe around 530 nm? Wait, wait, let me do the exact calculation.

1240 / 2.3393 ≈ Let's see. 2.3393 * 530 ≈ 1240? Let me compute 2.3393 * 530: 2 * 530 is 1060, 0.3393 *530 ≈ 180. So 1060 + 180 is 1240. Yes, exactly. So the wavelength is approximately 530 nm.

Wait, what color is 530 nm? I remember the visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The colors are roughly: violet ~400, blue around 450, green around 500, yellow around 570, orange 600, red 700. So 530 is in the green region. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh wait, wait, when a compound emits light, it's after it's been excited. So the compound absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light and then emits lower energy (longer wavelength) light. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. When something emits light, it's because it's dropping from a higher energy state to a lower one, so the emitted photon has energy corresponding to that drop. But wait, the dye emits light with energy 2.339 eV, which corresponds to green (530 nm). So what color is absorbed?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. The molecule is emitting light because it's dropping an electron from a higher to a lower energy state. The energy difference between those states is 2.339 eV. So that photon is emitted when the electron drops. But the energy absorbed would be higher than that when the electron gets excited in the first place. Or wait, sometimes when they talk about emission, the energy emitted is the same as the energy absorbed minus some losses, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait no, more accurately, the molecule absorbs a photon of a certain energy, gets excited, and then emits a photon when it relaxes. The absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one because some energy is lost as heat, but for the purpose of this question, maybe we can assume it's the same. Wait no, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV. So that's E_emit. The absorbed light would be at a higher energy, because that's what causes the excitation.

Wait, no, the energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So the molecule is in the ground state, absorbs a photon of higher energy (E_absorb), gets excited, then emits a photon of E_emit = E_absorb - E_loss (like thermal energy). But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as emitted? No, because the emitted energy is lower.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of complementary colors. If the dye emits green light (around 530 nm), then the absorbed light would be the complementary color. Because when you mix emitted and absorbed colors, you get white if they're complementary. Wait, but that's when dealing with color addition. So, if the compound emits green, it must absorb the complementary color. What's the complementary of green? It's magenta, but magenta isn't an option. Hmmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound absorbs a higher energy (shorter wavelength) photon than the one it emits. So if it emits at 530 nm (green), it absorbs at a shorter wavelength (higher energy). So the absorbed photon would be blue or violet.

Wait, let's think about the energy. The emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's find the color of the emitted light. 530 nm is green. So the dye is emitting green light. But when it absorbs light, it's absorbing the energy that excited it. So the absorbed light's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV because the molecule goes from ground state to excited state.

Wait, but wait. The energy levels: the molecule can go from ground state (E1) to a higher state (E2) upon absorbing a photon. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon with energy E_emit = E2 - E1. So the absorption would involve a photon with E_absorb = E2 - E1, same as the emitted photon. Wait, that can't be right because then the energy would be the same. Hmm, no, perhaps the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted, because the molecule might have multiple excited states.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon is given. The question is, what color is absorbed. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

If the emitted photon is green (530 nm), then the absorbed photon would be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that. So the absorbed photon is a higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm. So higher energy than 530 nm would be lower wavelength, blue (around 450) or violet (around 400). So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is about the color of the light absorbed. So the compound absorbs a certain color, which causes it to emit green. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed must be a higher energy (like blue or violet). Let's see the options. The options are A) Red (700 nm, lower energy than green), B) Violet (400, higher energy), C) Blue (450, higher), D) Yellow (570, lower than green).

So the absorbed light must be higher in energy than the emitted. So among the options, B (violet, 400) and C (blue, 450) are higher than 530. So the absorbed light is either violet or blue.

But wait, how are the energy levels related? Let me compute the energy for each. Let's take the 1240 nm rule again.

For example, for violet light (400 nm), E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. For blue (450), E≈2.76 eV. Green (530) is 2.339 eV. So the absorbed photon must be either violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.76 eV).

But the question says that the dye emits light at 2.339 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, which would be blue or violet. Now, which one is it?

Wait, but the question is asking what color is absorbed. So the correct answer must be either B or C. How can I choose between blue and violet?

But wait, the compound emits green. So if it's emitting green, the absorbed photon must be of higher energy, like blue or violet.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So which one is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color of the emitted light. Wait, no, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the emitted light is green. The absorbed light must be a higher energy, so blue or violet.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given options are A) Red (emits red, but that's lower energy than green, which doesn't make sense for absorption if the emission is green), B) Violet (higher energy), C) Blue (higher), D) Yellow (lower than green, so can't be the absorbed color).

So the options narrow it down to B or C. How to decide between them.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted photon. No, that can't be because the energy would be the same, but the emission is after the excitation, and perhaps the energy difference is the same. Hmm, no, that's not right. Because the molecule can have multiple energy levels.

Wait, another approach: the color absorbed is the complementary color to the emitted color. The complementary of green is magenta, which is a mix of blue and red. But magenta isn't an option. So perhaps this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed color is the same as the one emitted? No, that doesn't make sense because when a substance emits light, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy one. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted.

So the absorbed photon is either violet (3.1 eV) or blue (2.76 eV). Now, the question is, which one is it? The question says the compound has extensively conjugated pi-electrons. Extensive conjugation usually leads to absorption in the visible region, like for dyes. So the absorption is in the visible spectrum, so it's likely in the blue or violet.

Wait, but if the compound emits green, perhaps it's absorbing blue. Because blue absorption would make it appear the complementary color, which is orange, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the energy.

Emit: 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green).

Absorb: higher energy, so either blue (450 nm, E=2.76 eV) or violet (400 nm, E=3.1 eV).

Which of these is more likely for a compound with extensive conjugation?

Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy absorption (redder, longer wavelength). Because the more conjugated the molecule is, the lower the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, so the longer the wavelength (lower energy) of the absorbed photon.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So, if the molecule is more conjugated, the absorption wavelength is longer (lower energy). So if the emission is green (530 nm), the absorption would be in the higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green. But if the molecule has extensive conjugation, it might absorb at a longer wavelength than something less conjugated. Hmmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E_absorb - E_loss. So E_absorb is higher than E_emit. So if the emitted photon is green, the absorbed photon must be either blue or violet.

But if the molecule is extensively conjugated, that usually means a larger conjugated system, which leads to a smaller energy gap between HOMO and LUMO. A smaller energy gap corresponds to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So for a larger conjugated system, the absorption wavelength is longer. So if the emission is green (530 nm), the absorption would be in the red region? Wait, but that can't be because the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So if the molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_absorb, which is higher than E_emit, then the emitted photon would be E_emit = E_absorb - E_loss. So E_absorb must be higher than E_emit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try a different approach. The energy levels: the molecule starts in the ground state (E1). It absorbs a photon of energy E_absorb, taking it to an excited state (E2). Then, it emits a photon of energy E_emit = E2 - E1. So E_absorb = E_emit + E_loss, where E_loss is the energy lost as heat or other processes.

But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can ignore E_loss and assume E_absorb ≈ E_emit. But that doesn't make much sense because then the absorbed and emitted photons would be the same color, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the absorbed photon is in the same range as emitted, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. The emission is at 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon would be higher energy, so either blue (450) or violet (400). But which of these is the correct answer.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue. So let's think about the energy.

E_absorb = 1240 / λ (in nm). So for blue (450 nm): E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Violet: 1240/400=3.1 eV.

So the absorbed photon would have energy higher than 2.339 eV, so either 2.756 (blue) or 3.1 (violet). So the color absorbed would be either blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So the correct answer is either B or C.

But how to choose between them. Hmm.

Wait, because the compound emits green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed light must be a higher energy, so either blue or violet.

But wait, compounds with extensive conjugation tend to absorb in the visible region. So if the compound emits green, it's because it absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet), and then emitted green. So which one is it?

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO determines the absorbed photon's energy. A larger conjugated system has a lower energy gap, so longer wavelength (lower energy) absorption. So if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it would absorb at a longer wavelength than a less conjugated molecule. But since it's emitting green, which is a lower energy than blue or violet, maybe the absorbed photon is blue.

Wait, but I'm not fully confident. Let's think about some examples. For example, chlorophyll absorbs in the blue and red regions, and reflects green, which is why plants look green. So in that case, chlorophyll absorbs blue and red, and emits (or reflects) green. Wait, but chlorophyll doesn't emit; it's reflecting or transmitting. But in this case, the dye emits light, so perhaps the process is different.

Another example: fluorescent dyes. They absorb higher energy (blue or UV) and emit lower energy (like green or red). So for example, a fluorescent green dye absorbs blue light and emits green. So in that case, the absorbed color is blue, emitted is green.

So in that case, the absorbed color would be blue. So the correct answer is C) Blue.

So the answer would be option B or C? Wait, the example I thought of is that the absorbed is blue and emits green. So in that case, the correct answer is blue, option C.

Alternatively, if the dye emits green, the absorbed light is blue.

So the answer is C) Blue.

Wait, but wait. Let me just verify the energy. If the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Blue is 2.756 eV, which is higher than 2.3393. So the answer is blue, option C.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Using the shortcut \( \lambda (\text{nm}) = \frac{1240}{E (\text{eV})} \), the wavelength is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum. Since the dye emits green light, the absorbed light must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green, as the absorbed photon excites the molecule to a higher energy state, and the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and ground states.

The energy of the absorbed photon is related to the energy of the emitted photon by:

\[
E_{\text{absorb}} = E_{\text{emit}} + E_{\text{loss}},
\]

where \( E_{\text{loss}} \) accounts for energy lost as heat or other processes. For simplicity, we assume \( E_{\text{absorb}} \) is slightly higher than \( E_{\text{emit}} \). Using the same wavelength-to-energy relation, the absorbed photon must correspond to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, which places it in the blue or violet region of the spectrum.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) Red (700 nm, 1.77 eV):** Red light has a lower energy than green light, so it cannot be the absorbed photon. This is incorrect.
- **B) Violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV):** Violet light has a higher energy than green light and could be the absorbed photon. This is a valid option.
- **C) Blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV):** Blue light also has a higher energy than green light and could be the absorbed photon. This is another valid option.
- **D) Yellow (570 nm, 2.17 eV):** Yellow light has a lower energy than green light, so it cannot be the absorbed photon. This is incorrect.

The question specifies that the compound has "extensively conjugated pi-electrons." Extensive conjugation typically leads to absorption in the visible spectrum at longer wavelengths (lower energy). However, since the emitted photon corresponds to green light (530 nm), the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). Between violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV) and blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV), blue is more likely because it aligns with typical absorption behavior for dyes with conjugated systems.

Thus, the absorbed light is **blue**.

Answer: C
