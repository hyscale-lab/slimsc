Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see... the question gives me FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So, that makes sense if the compound has a carboxylic acid group because they have strong O-H bonds which show broad peaks. Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Since it's around 1700, it's probably a carboxylic acid because their carbonyls are around 1700-1725 cm^-1. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone, but the broad peak suggests carboxylic acid.

Now, the 1H NMR part. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. So the structure can't have any conjugated double bonds or any alkenes. That rules out any possibility of a structure with a vinyl group, but all the options here are branched maybe with ester groups or something else. Wait, looking at the options, they all seem to have CH2 and CH groups attached to a COOH.

The problem mentions several signals in the NMR. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, that's a bit complicated splitting. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So these are complex splitting patterns, probably due to coupling with multiple neighboring groups.

Let me think about the possible structures:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure would be something like CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. Wait, that's a four-carbon chain? Because the main chain is from the COOH. Let me count. COOH is the end. Before that, probably a CH2 group attached to a CH which is connected to another CH, which is attached to a CH2CH3 (from CH2C...). Wait, maybe it's more like:

The structure is (CH3)2CH-C(H)(CH3)-COOH? Or maybe branching. Alternatively, the structure could be a geminal di-substituted group.

Wait, maybe I should draw each structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So that's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central part has two CH groups, each attached to ethyl groups. So each CH is connected to an ethyl, and then a CH2COOH at the end.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure would be CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central two CH groups each have an ethyl group, and one end is CH2CH3, the other end COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So it's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. The two central CHs each have a methyl group attached.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. The central CHs each have a methyl. So, the structure is similar to option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to figure out how each structure looks.

So all options have COOH at one end. The other end varies. Let's think about the NMR.

In the NMR, none of the peaks are vinyl, so alkenes are out. So all these structures are saturated. So the structures are all branched alkanes attached to a COOH.

In the NMR, each proton environment would give a distinct signal. So, for each CH group, depending on their substituents, the protons would split into different multiplets.

Let me look at each option's structure and predict the NMR signals.

Option D: Structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the COOH is at one end. The next is a CH2 connected to a CH which has a CH3 and another CH which has a CH3. So the structure is:

CH2CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - COOH.

Wait, no, the formula is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is from left to right: CH3CH2 (as a group), then C(H)(CH3), then C(H)(CH3), then COOH.

Wait, no, the way the formula is written, it's CH3CH2 as a substituent on the C which is connected to another C. So:

The backbone is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the main chain is four carbons from the COOH: COOH-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of each option's structure step by step.

Option D: The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, starting from the COOH group, the previous carbon is a CH which is connected to a CH3 group. Then the next carbon is another CH connected to another CH3 group. Then the next group is CH2CH3.

Wait, no, I think the structure is:

- The molecule is CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So the backbone is COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because in the formula, the substituents are branching off the carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure as:

The COOH is on
