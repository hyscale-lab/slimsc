Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. 

Alright, let's see the details. Both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. So the orbital periods are 2 years and 1 year for systems 1 and 2.

Then, there's spectroscopic data. For system_1, the radial velocity variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Wait, radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed each star moves towards or away from us. So each star in the binary system has its own velocity amplitude. I think the velocity amplitude is related to the mass of the companion star.

Oh right! There's this formula that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the mass of the companion. I remember K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, and i is the inclination of the orbit. But since we're dealing with eclipsing binaries, i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is nearly 1. So maybe that's not a factor here.

Wait, but for each star in the binary, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So if system_1 has velocities of 10 and 5 km/s, their mass ratio would be M1/M2 = v2 / v1. Because the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

So for system_1: v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (0.5 M2) + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Alternatively, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by K = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3
