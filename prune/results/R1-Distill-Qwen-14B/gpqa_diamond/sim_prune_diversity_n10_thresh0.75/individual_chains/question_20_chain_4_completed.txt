Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the impulse approximation used in many-body nuclear calculations. It says that this approximation assumes nucleons behave like free nucleons. I remember that the impulse approximation is used when considering interactions, like electroweak, where each nucleon is treated as if it's acting independently, almost as if it's free from the nucleus.

The question is asking which of the four given assumptions jointly imply this impulse approximation. The options are 1,2,3,4. Let's look at each statement.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
Hmm, that makes sense. If the interaction only affects each nucleon individually, then each is treated separately, like being free. So statement 1 seems to support the impulse approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
Wait, what does 'transparent' mean here? I think it refers to how the interaction passes through the nucleus without affecting other nucleons. So if the nucleus is transparent except for the selected one, then other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. That would mean each nucleon is independent, reinforcing the idea of treating them as free. So statement 2 is another supporting assumption.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
Hmm, this is about the state of quarks inside the nucleon. If they're non-relativistic, that would mean their velocities are low, so relativistic effects are negligible. How does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, the impulse approximation often neglects the internal structure of nucleons, treating them as point particles. So if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it's easier to model the nucleon as a simple entity, not considering their internal dynamics. But I'm not entirely sure if this directly contributes to the approximation. Maybe it's a separate assumption about the nucleon's structure, not the interaction's treatment.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
Oh, this makes sense. If the binding forces are ignored, then the nucleon feels no pull from its neighbors. So it's treated as if it's free, moving without being influenced by others. So statement 4 supports the approximation.

Now, the question is which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. So I need to see which combination is correct.

The impulse approximation is about each nucleon acting independently. So statements 1 and 4 directly imply that, as they're about the interaction being individual and no binding, respectively.

Statement 2 says the nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. So other nucleons don't affect the interaction, meaning each is treated separately. So 2 is also a supporting condition.

What about statement 3? It's about quarks being non-relativistic. I'm not sure that directly implies the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is more about the treatment of the nucleon in the nucleus, not about the internal state of the nucleon. So statement 3 might not be necessary for the impulse approximation.

So the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. Let me check the options:

Option A is 1,2,4. That seems to fit. Option B is 2,3,4, which includes 3, which I'm unsure about. Option C includes 1,2,3, which would include statement 3. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, so if I'm thinking about the assumptions, 1 is the interaction with individual nucleons, 2 is nucleus transparency (so only one nucleon interacts), 4 is no binding. So together, 1, 2, and 4 would imply that each nucleon is treated as free because the interaction only affects one, others don't interfere, and the binding is ignored.

So the correct answer must be option A: 1,2,4.

Wait, but what about statement 3? If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that impact whether the nucleon is treated as free? I think that's more about the structure of the nucleon, not the interaction with the rest. So perhaps statement 3 isn't needed for the impulse approximation.


The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as if they are free, with no significant interaction except with the external force. To determine which assumptions imply this approximation, let us analyze each statement:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**  
   This assumption aligns with the impulse approximation because it implies that each nucleon is treated independently, as if it is free from the nucleus.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**  
   This means that the interaction affects only the selected nucleon, and other nucleons are ignored. This reinforces the idea of treating nucleons as free and independent.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**  
   This statement pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon and whether relativistic effects are negligible. However, the impulse approximation primarily concerns the treatment of nucleons in the nucleus, not their internal dynamics. Thus, this assumption does not directly imply the impulse approximation.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**  
   By ignoring binding forces, the nucleon is treated as if it is free, which is a key feature of the impulse approximation.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. These assumptions ensure that each nucleon is treated independently and free from external influences, consistent with the impulse approximation. Statement 3, while related to nucleon structure, does not directly contribute to this approximation.

**Answer: A**
