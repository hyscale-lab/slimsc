Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic poles, right? Because if you have a magnet, it has both a north and south pole, so their magnetic fields cancel out when you take the divergence.

But in this hypothetical universe, magnets can have isolated poles. So, that would imply that the divergence of B isn't zero. Because if you have a single north pole, for example, it's like a positive source in magnetic terms. So the equation ∇·B = something else, not zero.

Wait, so in Maxwell's equations, the second one would change. So the equation related to the divergence of the magnetic field would look different. Because in our case, it's zero because there are no monopoles, but here, maybe there are, so ∇·B = rho_m (where rho_m is the magnetic charge density) or something like that.

So the first equation (Gauss's Law for E) stays the same because that's about electric charge. The second equation, which is about the divergence of B, changes.

Now the question is, which of the options say that only the divergence of B is different, or if other equations change.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So this would imply that equation 2 is different. But let me think—is any other equation affected?

In our universe, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. That comes from the absence of magnetic monopoles. Wait, wait. If there were magnetic monopoles, would Faraday's Law change? Or would that affect the other equations?

I think that if magnetic monopoles exist, then two of Maxwell's equations would change. Because Gauss's Law for magnetism would have a magnetic charge term, and Faraday's Law might pick up a term related to magnetic current.

Wait, let me think again. Without magnetic monopoles, ∇·B = 0 and ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If monopoles exist, then ∇·B would be rho_m / something, and maybe ∇×E would have an additional term, like a magnetic current density.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. Without monopoles, Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. ∇·B = 0
3.
