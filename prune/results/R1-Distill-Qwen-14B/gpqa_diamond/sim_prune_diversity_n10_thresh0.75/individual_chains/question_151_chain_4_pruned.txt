Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific value, which is 0. 

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? So I need to check if this vector is normalized. To do that, I'll calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So the vector is [-1, 2, 1]. Let me compute each component squared: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That might complicate things. Because probabilities in quantum mechanics depend on the state being a unit vector. So I think I'll need to normalize this state first.

To normalize, I'll divide each component by the square root of the sum, which is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector becomes:

(-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, but I should keep that in mind for later steps.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, but that's a 3x3 matrix. Now, in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible results are the eigenvalues, and I'm looking for the probability that the measurement yields 0.

So to find the eigenvalues of P, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the
