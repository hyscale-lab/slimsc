Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me think. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, p is a proton, and p̄ is an antiproton. So they annihilate each other and produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Interesting.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. Oh, and they gave m_A c² as 300 MeV. Oh right, mass energy equivalence. So m_A c² is 300 MeV. But wait, I think I need to find the velocity of each particle A.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial kinetic energy is maybe low, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe considering the rest frame. Hmm.

Wait, annihilation usually converts mass into energy. But here, the products are two A particles each with charge + and -. So the total charge should balance. The initial charge is p (charge +e) and p̄ (charge -e), so total charge zero. The products are 2A⁺ and 2A⁻, which is 2(+e) +2(-e) = 0. So charge is conserved. Okay.

But how to find the velocity of A. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton? Or maybe in their center of mass frame, the momentum is zero? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe its velocity is much less than c, so non-relativistic? Or maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to their rest mass. But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass, right? So each has rest mass energy about 938 MeV (I think). So if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with low speed.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some slow speed. Or maybe in the center of mass frame, but the problem isn't clear.

Wait, perhaps the initial frame is the lab frame where the proton is at rest. Then the antiproton is moving with some slow velocity. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the system's total
