Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and quantum field theory. Hmm, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let's start by recalling some basics.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are antisymmetric and often come into play in theories involving spinors and fields like the electromagnetic field tensor F.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, in natural units where ℏ = c = 1, the mass dimension of an action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the integral is over 4 dimensions.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let's break down each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

The ψ̄ and ψ are Dirac spinors. Each spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac field ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3.

Next, σ_{μν}, which is formed from the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices without any mass scaling. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

Then F^{μν} is the electromagnetic field tensor. The field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because the field A has [A] = 1, and F is the derivative of A, so [∂ A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Putting it all together: ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions are (3/2) + (3/2) for ψ̄ and ψ, but wait, wait. Wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. Then multiplied by F^{μν}, which is 2. So the whole term has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term κ must adjust this. The term κ ψ̄ σ F must have dimension 4. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5, so κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, is that right? Because the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by the rest. So the whole term is κ * (dimension 5), which must equal 4. So κ has dimension 4 -5 = -1. So that's correct. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Next, the renormalizability of the theory. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension (or zero). Because the dimension determines the superficial degree of divergence. If a coupling has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable, which typically means it's effective and only valid up to a certain energy scale.

Wait, wait. So in our case, κ has [κ] = -1, which is negative. So the interaction term is of higher dimension, implying that the theory has higher-order interactions. Therefore, the theory isn't renormalizable because you can't absorb the infinities with a finite number of counterterms. Only couplings with non-negative dimensions (like dimension 0, 1, 2, etc.) in 4D theories are renormalizable. So because κ is dimension -1, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, in 4D, renormalizable theories have interactions terms with coupling constants that have mass dimension ≤4 (I think). Wait, no, more accurately, for a term in the Lagrangian L, each term must have dimension 4. The coupling constant's dimension depends on the term.

In a renormalizable theory, all the interaction terms must have coupling constants with positive mass dimension. Because the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the number of loops and the power of the momentum. If a term has a coupling with negative mass dimension, it's a higher-dimensional operator and the theory isn't renormalizable because the coupling becomes weaker at lower energies (so you can't have a perturbative expansion that's valid at all scales).

So in our case, κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the term is of higher dimension. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable. So putting it all together, the mass dimension is -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable. Looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because it's not renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. No.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. Yes.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the electromagnetic field tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In natural units, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four spacetime dimensions. Each term in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must therefore have mass dimension 4.

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi} \psi$ has mass dimension $3$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$, the field strength tensor, has mass dimension $2$ because it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension $1$.

Thus, the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a total mass dimension of $3 + 2 = 5$. Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension $4$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must have mass dimension $-1$ to ensure the entire term has dimension $4$. Therefore, $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories typically require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them effective theories valid only at low energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
