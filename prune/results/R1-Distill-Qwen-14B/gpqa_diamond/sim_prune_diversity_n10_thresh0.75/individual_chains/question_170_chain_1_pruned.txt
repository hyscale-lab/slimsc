Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. An electron is in a spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the corresponding operator. 

Wait, the state is given as a vector (3i, 4). Let me think about how spin states work. Spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, right? Like, if the state is |ψ⟩ = [a; b], then the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if it's a non-normalized state.

Wait, the operator for spin in the y-direction, S_y, is given in matrix form as sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators, and each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. But wait, I should first check if the state is normalized. Let's compute the norm. The state is (3i, 4), so the inner product is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) because when you take the conjugate transpose, it becomes (-3i, 4), and then you multiply each component.

Calculating that: (3i)*
