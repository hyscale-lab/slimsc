Okay, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given reaction and the NMR data. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the question says that Compound X (C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to identify Compound X from the options A to D.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Diazabicyclooctane is a strong base, right? It's often used in deprotonation reactions. Oh, right! It's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes via the Prilezhaev epoxidation or maybe in some elimination reactions. Alternatively, I remember that when an alkene reacts with a peracid, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction here is with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. Hmm, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed epoxide opening or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, wait. Another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, and when it's used under certain conditions, it can perform an elimination reaction. Oh! Maybe it's involved in the ring-opening of an epoxide. Because in some cases, epoxides can undergo ring-opening under basic conditions, especially with strong bases.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So, the product must have certain features. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, there are two singlets integrating to 3H each, likely two methyl groups. The aromatic region has a double doublet pattern. Let me think: perhaps two doublets with 2H and 1H each, which might indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring, but some splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted styrene or something similar.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- Two methyl carbons at δ 21.3 and 28.4 (each singlet)
- Several aromatic carbons: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s)
- Two carbons at higher shifts: 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s)
- And a carbonyl at 197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm, the 197.7 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. Could it be an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm in
