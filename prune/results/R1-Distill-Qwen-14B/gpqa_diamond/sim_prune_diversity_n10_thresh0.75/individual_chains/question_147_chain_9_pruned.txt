Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it.

The question is: a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its speed is low. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. I remember that in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles. But the process here is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The products are four mesons, assuming A is a meson since it's a particle with charge. Or wait, maybe A is a different kind of particle, but probably a meson.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of a proton is around 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton's rest mass is the same as the proton's. But if it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its energy as just its rest energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving." So, perhaps it's moving at a low speed, so that relativistic effects are minimal. That would mean that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So we can approximate the energy as just the rest energy.

So, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about conservation laws. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, their combined energy and momentum must equal the energy and momentum of the resulting particles.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, and the proton is at rest. Or is the proton also moving? Well, the question doesn't specify, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, their momenta would cancel out. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low speed v.

Wait
