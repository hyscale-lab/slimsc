Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps to calculate the enthalpy change.

Let me read the question again. It says: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So all these are being mixed together. I guess I need to find out the net reaction between all these substances.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since H2SO4 is diprotic, it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 metal hydroxide, I think. So when they mix, they'll react to form water and a salt.

But wait, H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might form BaSO4, right? Because sulfuric acid is H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. So each molecule of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. The reaction would be with Ba(OH)2, which has two OH- ions per formula unit.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first. That way, I can figure out the limiting reagent. Because the neutralization reaction depends on which reagent is in excess.

First, calculate moles for each solution.

HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

H2SO4: 0.3 M, 0.3 L (300 mL). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 0.2 L (200 mL). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So OH- moles are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water. So let's see the total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. HCl is a strong acid, so all 0.1 moles will dissociate into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ ions will dissociate. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

On the base side, Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles of OH-.

The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is the neutralization enthalpy, which I think is around -57 kJ/mol, but wait, I might be mixing up the value. Or maybe it's per mole of H+?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH- to form water. So each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ (but wait, I've also heard it as 57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which is the same thing since each reaction produces one mole).

Wait, but I think the exact value is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), since each
