Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt ions and thiocyanate complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ maybe? Or wait, what are the possible complexes? Cobalt can form different complexes with different numbers of SCN- ions.

The stability constants β are for each step of complex formation. So β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, and so on. So the formation of each complex is stepwise.

The problem is about the distribution of all possible cobalt species. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which includes all the complexes and the free Co^2+ ions.

So each β is the formation constant for the nth complex. So for Co(SCN)_n^2+.

The first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, has β1=9. Then the next, [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}, β2=40, and so on. Wait, actually, wait. Let me clarify: the stability constant for each step.

Wait, the nth stability constant is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ - n+} from the previous complex. Or perhaps, wait, each β is the cumulative constant for the n-th ligand. Or is it the stepwise? Oh, wait, I think stability constants are usually given as stepwise. So β1 is K1 for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is K2 for adding another SCN to form [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

Wait, or are they cumulative? I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, the stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the n-th step: [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+n−n) + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_{n+1}].

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this using the cumulative formation constants. Because when considering the distribution, the fraction of each complex is based on the product of all the β's up to that point.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formation in steps. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ [CoSCN]^+, K1=9. The second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2], K2=40. The third step is [Co(SCN)_2] + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^-, K3=63. The fourth step is [Co(SCN)_3}^- + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, K4=16.

But wait, the problem gives β1, β2, β3, β4 as 9,40,63,16. So each β is the stepwise constant for adding each SCN-.

So the formation of each complex is sequential. So the overall formation constants (cumulative) for each complex are:

β_total for [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1 = 9.

For [Co(SCN)_2], it's β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^-, it's β1 * β2 * β3 = 9*40*63 = 22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, it's β1*β2*β3*β4 = 9*40*63*16 = let's calculate that: 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, 22680 *16 is 362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because sometimes the stability constant is given as the cumulative one. But in this question, since β values are given as separate, they must be stepwise. So each complex's formation is a step, and the overall K for each complex is the product of the βs up to that step.

So the complexes we can form are:

Co^2+ (free ion),

[Co(SCN)]^+,

[Co(SCN)_2]^0,

[Co(SCN)_3]^−,

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2−}.

Wait, but wait, each [Co(SCN)_n] has a charge of
