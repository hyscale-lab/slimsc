Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what's going on here. The question involves a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and ending with product 4. I need to figure out the structure of product 4 based on the reactions described.

Alright, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. So, on a cyclohexane ring, position 1 is a ketone (cyclohexanone). Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is a substituent with a double bond between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2-C(CH2)-. Wait, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2-C=CH2? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is CH2- attached to the cyclohexane, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl: the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the substituent is at position 5, and it's prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2- attached to the cyclohexane, and then a double bond between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2-C=CH2. No, that's allyl group. Hmm. Maybe it's (CH2CH2CH3) with a double bond? No, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2), but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused
