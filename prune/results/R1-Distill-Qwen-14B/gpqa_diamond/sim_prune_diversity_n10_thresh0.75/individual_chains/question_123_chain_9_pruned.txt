Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that a supernova's ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed, right? Because if in the ejecta's frame the Galaxy is moving towards them, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy.

The question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so we have time given in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but the problem mentions that both are inertial frames. So this is a scenario where we can apply the classical velocity addition formula, or maybe the relativistic one? Hmm, because the speed is quite highâ€”60,000 km/s. Let me calculate how fast that is in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light. So 0.2c. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might be significant. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and other movements, so maybe it's just a question of time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, no. The problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we have to relate the proper time (in the ejecta's frame) to the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because if the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds, the Galaxy would see that as a different amount of time due to time dilation.

Wait, but the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy. Let me think about it. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 0.2c. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galactic center is approaching quickly. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving
