--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds known. Let me try to break down the information step by step.

The question mentions several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. I need to figure out what each of these might be, especially focusing on A4 and its molecular weight. The options given are ranges, so I need to determine which range the molecular weight falls into.

Starting with A1. It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about 20°C or room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidation implies that A1 is acting as an oxidizing agent, so it's probably a strong oxidizing agent. What are some red-colored fluorine compounds that are strong oxidizers?

I remember that some fluorine compounds have intense colors. For example, ClF3 is pale yellow, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, there's also F2, which is a diatomic gas, but that's not a binary compound with another element. Alternatively, maybe A1 is some kind of oxyfluoride or perhaps a fluorine-rich compound.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So A2 must be a fluorine compound as well. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. oF usually stands for oxygen-free fluorine, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, maybe it's the oxygen-free fluorine content. Or perhaps it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. Let me think: 31.96% fluorine... Could that be a specific compound?

Wait, another angle: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, Y is an element that forms multiple binary compounds with fluorine. So Y must have several possible oxidation states. Fluorine typically has a -1 charge in most compounds, so Y would have positive charges. For example, elements like chlorine, but wait, Y is another element. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like iodine? Hmm, but the number five binary compounds would require Y to have multiple oxidation states. Let me think of elements that form several fluorides.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is an alkali metal? Like sodium or potassium? Or maybe a transition metal? Let's see, five binary compounds. For example, tin has SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. Hmm, but that's three. Alternatively, lead has multiple fluorides: PbF2, PbF4. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? But then the fluorides would be ClF, ClF3, ClF5? Wait, that's three. But the question says five binary compounds. Oh, maybe Y is oxygen? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. It forms PF3, PF5, and possibly others? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three. Hmm, not enough. Maybe Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states. Let me think: perhaps Y is molybdenum or something, but that's a bit obscure.

Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Let me think again. Wait, phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, and maybe others. Hmm, but I'm not sure about five. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's get back to A1. If A1 is a fluorine compound that oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, that suggests A1 is a powerful oxidizing agent. Xenon is usually unreactive, so the compound must induce a reaction. Which fluorine compound is a strong oxidizer? Maybe something like F2O, but that's not right. Wait, another thought: maybe A1 is ClF3? No, because ClF3 is a strong oxidizer and a good fluorinating agent. Wait, but ClF3 is yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: could A1 be O2F2? I'm not too sure about its properties, but oxygen difluoride is a thing. I think it's a colorless gas, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's something like FClO? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is F2. But F2 is a diatomic gas, and when it decomposes, it would just be F atoms, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the decomposition of A1. It produces A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction would be:

A1 → A2 + F2.

Wait, if A2 is a compound containing fluorine, then perhaps A1 is a more complex compound that breaks down into a simpler one plus F2. For example, suppose A1 is something like YF5, decomposing into YF3 and F2. Or perhaps YF4 decomposing into YF2 and F2.

Wait, but we need more clues. Let's think about A3. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so it's a fluorine compound of Y. A3 can interact with xenon as well. So, perhaps A3 is a stronger fluorinating agent than A1 or A2?

The problem statement says that A1 oxidizes xenon, and A3 can also interact with it. So, A3 is another oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure.

Another part: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm. So, A4 is a solution, probably a fluoride. Maybe A4 is YF3?

Wait, if Y is added to A4, which is a solution, perhaps a hydrofluoride. Wait, adding Y metal to a solution of its fluoride might produce a more complex fluoride or perhaps a different oxidation state.

Wait, for example, if A4 is YF3 (which is a solution, maybe in water?), adding Y metal in 1:1 molar ratio would perhaps form YF5? But wait, YF5 is a gas. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, but when Y is added to a solution of A4, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Let me think, perhaps if A5 is a more complex fluoride that upon hydrolysis yields Y's oxide and HF, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a fluoride ion source. For example, if A4 is YF3, and Y is added, maybe it's a precipitation reaction or a redox reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think of the properties. The problem states that A1 is bright red and decomposes to A2 (with 31.96% fluorine) and F2. Let me think of the decomposition reaction. Suppose A1 is YF5. When it decomposes, could it produce YF3 and F2?

Wait, but if YF5 decomposes, the reaction would be YF5 → YF3 + F2. Let's check the fluorine percentages.

Assuming Y is a particular element. Let's take Y as chlorine for a moment. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) decomposes, but I'm not sure what it produces. Alternatively, maybe Y is phosphorus. Suppose Y is P. Then, if A1 is PF5 (phosphorus pentafluoride), which is a liquid at room temp, but PF5 is colorless, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, what about ClF3? ClF3 is a yellowish-green liquid. No, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is something like F2O2? No, I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe it's F2O. But F2O is a gas, and I'm not sure about its color.

Wait, perhaps the bright red substance is another compound. Oh! I recall that some transition metal fluorides are colored. For example, manganese heptafluoride (MnF7) is a bright red solid. Wait, does that decompose into something else and F2?

Alternatively, maybe A1 is a different compound. Another possibility: what about FClO2? No, I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, perhaps A1 is a fluorinated oxide. Suppose Y is oxygen? No, that doesn't make sense because oxygen can't form binary compounds with fluorine in a way that would give multiple binary compounds. Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, because the question says binary compounds of fluorine with Y, so oxygen wouldn't be Y in that case.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the fluorine percentage in A2. A2 has 31.96% fluorine. Let's calculate what that could be. Let's say the compound is YF_x. The fluorine percentage is (19 * x)/(atomic weight of Y + 19x) ) * 100 =31.96%.

So, 19x/(Y + 19x) = 0.3196.

Let me rearrange that: 19x = 0.3196(Y +19x)
19x = 0.3196 Y + 6.0724x
19x -6.0724x = 0.3196 Y
12.9276 x = 0.3196 Y
So, Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) x
Approximately 40.52 x.

So, since Y is an element, let's think of possible Y and x that satisfy this. Let's consider x=3. Then Y ≈40.52 *3 =121.56. But no element has that atomic weight.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, 19x / (Y +19x) = 0.3196.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

19x = 0.3196 (Y +19x)

19x = 0.3196 Y + 6.0724 x

Bring terms with x to one side:

19x -6.0724x =0.3196 Y

12.9276 x =0.3196 Y

So Y= (12.9276 / 0.3196) x 

Which is approximately 40.52 x.

So let's try x=3: Y= 121.56. Not possible.

x=4: Y=162.08. Not possible.

x=2: Y=81.04, which is close to lead (Pb is 207). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe x=1: Y=40.52, which is approximately titanium (Ti is 47.867). Not exact, but maybe close.

Wait, perhaps Y is another element. Let me think of Y as having an atomic weight around 40.52 when x=1. But that's not matching any common elements. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 19x/(Y +19x) = 31.96/100 = 0.3196.

So,

19x = 0.3196 (Y +19x)

19x = 0.3196 Y + 6.0724 x

19x -6.0724x = 0.3196 Y

12.9276 x = 0.3196 Y

Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) x ≈40.52 x.

Hmm, perhaps Y is 80 when x=2 (since 40.52 *2=81, close to lead). Or x=1: Y=40.52, which is close to Zr (zirconium, ~91) no, that's higher. Wait, 40 is close to Zn (zinc) which is about 65.38. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I should think of a different approach. Maybe A2 is a known compound with 31.96% fluorine.

Let me think of some common fluorine compounds and their fluorine percentages.

For example, ClF3. Cl has atomic weight about 35.5. So, ClF3: 3*19=57. 57/(35.5 +57) =57/92.5 ≈61.68%. Not 31.96%.

Another compound: BrF3. Br is about 80. 3*19=57. 57/(80+57)=57/137≈41.6%. Not matching.

Wait, maybe it's a diatomic or another structure. Wait, what about YF3 where Y is an element with a higher atomic weight.

Wait, let's calculate for YF3: 

Fluorine percentage is (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) * 100 =31.96.

So,

57/(Y +57) =0.3196

Multiply both sides by denominator:

57 =0.3196 (Y +57)

57 =0.3196 Y + 18.1572

57-18.1572=0.3196 Y

38.8428 =0.3196 Y

Y= 38.8428 /0.3196 ≈ 121.56 g/mol.

But that's not a known element. So perhaps A2 is not YF3.

Wait another approach: Let me consider that A2 is F2. No, because F2 is diatomic and would have 100% fluorine, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps A2 is something like YF, but then x=1. Let me plug x=1 into the equation.

Y=40.52 *1=40.52. Not a known element.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the decomposition of A1.

A1 → A2 + F2.

Suppose A1 is a more complex fluoride that breaks down into a simpler one and fluorine. For example, if A1 is YF5, then decomposition could be YF5 → YF3 + F2. Let's see:

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

Let me balance this equation. Let's write it as:

a YF5 → b YF3 + c F2.

Balancing Y: a = b.

Balancing F: 5a = 3b + 2c.

Since a = b, we can substitute:

5a = 3a + 2c → 2a=2c → a=c.

So, let a=1, then b=1, c=1.

So the equation becomes:

YF5 → YF3 + F2.

Which is balanced for Y and F.

So, if A1 is YF5 and A2 is YF3, then what's the fluorine percentage in YF3?

As calculated earlier, (3*19)/(Y +3*19) )=31.96% → Y≈121.56, which isn't possible. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, maybe A1 is a different compound. Let me think of another decomposition. Suppose A1 is YF3 decomposing into Y and F2. No, that would produce Y and F2, but A2 would be Y, which is an element, not a compound, which contradicts the statement that A2 is a binary compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a more complex oxide-fluoride. Hmm, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the elements that form five binary fluorides. So Y has five different binary compounds with fluorine. Let me think of possible elements.

Clorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three. Not five.

Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5. That's three.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three.

Another thought: perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states. For example, molybdenum (Mo) can have several fluorides: MoF4, MoF6, etc. But I'm not sure about five.

Wait, another possibility: Y is lead (Pb). Lead forms PbF2, PbF4, PbF6. That's three. Hmm, not five.

Wait, perhaps Y is tin (Sn). Sn forms SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. Again, three. Not enough.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is a metalloid. Let's think about phosphorus. It can form PF3, PF5, and maybe others. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps Y is germanium. It forms GeF2, GeF4, GeF6. That's three.

Wait, maybe it's Y being a transition metal with more than three oxidation states. Let's think about chromium. Chromium forms CrF2, CrF3, CrF4, CrF6. That's four. Not five yet.

Wait, another thought: Y could be a lanthanide element, which can form multiple fluorides. But I'm not sure which specific one.

Alternatively, maybe Y is fluorine itself, but that wouldn't make sense since fluorine is diatomic.

Wait, perhaps Y is an element that can form fluorides with multiple structures, such as different coordination numbers. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a non-metal with multiple possible structures. Hmm, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let me think of the problem differently. The fact that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y suggests that it's a direct fluorination product. So, perhaps A3 is the most stable or a common fluoride.

Now, considering that A1 is a bright red substance that oxidizes xenon. Xenon is usually inert, so the fluorine compound must be a strong oxidizer. F2 is a strong oxidizer, but A1 is a compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is O2F2, which is a strong oxidizing agent. But I'm not certain about its color. Alternatively, maybe it's ClF3, which is a strong oxidizing agent and yellow.

Wait, I think I'm stuck on A1. Maybe I should proceed to other parts of the problem and see if it helps.

The part about A4 and A5. When Y is added to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Let me think about possible reactions. If A4 is a fluoride, perhaps YF3, and Y is added, maybe it's displacing something. Or perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A4 is a solution of a different fluoride, like NH4HF2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if A4 is YF3 and Y is added, perhaps it forms a more complex fluoride, like YF5. But YF5 is a gas, so perhaps it's not that.

Wait, another approach: When Y is added to a solution of a fluoride, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. For example, if A4 is YF3, adding Y metal in a 1:1 ratio might not change much. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double displacement reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, upon further thought: when you add a metal to a solution of its own fluoride, perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. For example, if A4 is YF3, adding Y metal might not react because it's the same metal and fluoride. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps A4 is a different fluoride. For instance, if A4 is YF4, adding Y metal might form YF5. But I'm not certain about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: when A5 is formed and then decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps it's a decomposition into an oxide and HF. For example, if A5 is YF5, then YF5 + H2O → Y(OH)F4 + HF. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a fluoride that's more soluble or less stable. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A4 is a binary compound of Y and F. For example, if Y is sodium (Na), then possible fluorides are NaF, NaF2 (not common), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Y as having an atomic weight that, when combined with fluorine, gives a molecular weight in one of the given ranges. The question is asking for the molecular weight of A4, which is a binary compound of Y and F.

Wait, if I can figure out Y, then I can find A4's molecular weight.

Wait, another thought: if A1 is a compound of Y and F, and when it decomposes, it produces A2 (YF3) and F2, then YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2. So, the molecular weight of A1 (YF5) would be Y + 5*19 = Y +95.

If I can find Y, I can find A4's molecular weight.

But I'm stuck because I can't figure out what Y is.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the fluorine percentage in A2. Earlier, I found that if A2 is YF3, then Y≈121.56, which is not possible. So perhaps A2 is not YF3. Maybe A2 is a different compound. Wait, perhaps A2 is YF2.

Wait, let's recalculate with A2 as YF2. So, fluorine percentage is (2*19)/(Y +38) ) =31.96%.

So,

38/(Y +38) =0.3196 → 38=0.3196*(Y+38)

38 =0.3196 Y + 12.1428

38-12.1428 =0.3196 Y →25.8572=0.3196 Y → Y=25.8572/0.3196 ≈80.8.

Hmm, 80.8 is close to the atomic weight of lead (Pb is about 207). No, that's too high. Wait, 80.8 is close to mercury (Hg is about 200.6), no. Hmm, maybe it's another element. Wait, 80.8 is close to Br (79.904). Wait, bromine is about 80. So Y would be bromine?

Wait, if Y is bromine, then the fluorine percentage in YF2 would be (38)/(80 +38)=38/118≈32.2%. Which is close to 31.96%. So that might fit.

So Y could be bromine (Br). Then, let's see if bromine forms five binary fluorides. Let's think: BrF, BrF3, BrF5. That's three. Hmm, I thought BrF2 exists as well, so that's four. Are there five? Alternatively, maybe there's another structure. Hmm... I might be missing one, but perhaps the problem is considering these as five, or maybe Y is a different element.

Wait, but let me proceed. If Y is bromine, then A1 is perhaps BrF5. When it decomposes, it produces BrF3 and F2.

So, decomposition reaction: BrF5 → BrF3 + F2.

Let me balance that.

BrF5 → BrF3 + F2.

Left side: 1 Br, 5 F.

Right side: 1 Br, 3 F + 2 F (from F2) → total 5 F.

So, equation is balanced as is. 1 BrF5 → 1 BrF3 + 1 F2.

So that fits. Fluorine percentage in BrF3 is 3*19/(80 +3*19) =57/(80+57)=57/137≈41.59%. Wait, but earlier we thought A2 has 31.96% fluorine. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the fluorine percentage for BrF3.

BrF3: Br is 80, F3 is 57. So total molecular weight is 137 g/mol. Fluorine percentage is (57/137)*100 ≈41.59%. But the problem states that A2 has 31.96% F. So that's not matching. So perhaps Y isn't bromine.

Hmm, back to the calculation. If Y is approximately 80.8, which is close to Br (79.9), but the fluorine percentage doesn't match. So maybe Y isn't Br.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming A2 is YF2 or YF3. Perhaps A2 is a different compound.

Wait, another approach: 31.96% F. Let me think of a compound where F is about 32% by mass. Let me think of some known fluorides.

For example, NaF: F is 19/(23+19)=19/42≈45.2%. No.

CaF2: F is (2*19)/(40+38) )=38/78≈48.7%. No.

MgF2: same as CaF2, 48.7%.

AlF3: (3*19)/(27+57)=57/84≈67.9%. No.

SiF4: (4*19)/(28+76)=76/104≈73.08%. No.

PF3: 57/(31+57)=57/88≈64.77%. No.

ClF3: 57/(35.5+57)=57/92.5≈61.68%. No.

BrF3:57/(80+57)=57/137≈41.59%. No.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A2 is a different compound, maybe YF. Let's calculate Y.

If A2 is YF, then fluorine percentage is 19/(Y +19) = 0.3196.

So,

19 =0.3196 (Y +19)

19 =0.3196 Y +6.0724

19-6.0724=0.3196 Y →12.9276=0.3196 Y → Y=12.9276/0.3196≈40.52.

Which is approximately the atomic weight of titanium (Ti is about 47.867). Hmm, close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is zirconium (Zr, ~91 g/mol), which is higher than 40.52. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps A2 is YF4. Let's calculate fluorine percentage:

(4*19)/(Y +4*19) )=31.96%.

So,

76/(Y +76) =0.3196 →76=0.3196*(Y +76)

76=0.3196 Y + 24.2736 →76-24.2736=0.3196 Y →51.7264=0.3196 Y → Y≈51.7264/0.3196≈161.55.

Hmm, that's high. No known element with that atomic weight. So perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The problem says that A1 is a bright red substance. What's a bright red fluorine compound I know of? I think MnF7 is bright red. Let me check: MnF7 is a bright red solid. So perhaps A1 is MnF7.

If A1 is MnF7, which decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's write the reaction:

MnF7 → MnF3 + F2.

Wait, can MnF7 decompose into MnF3 and F2? Let's see:

MnF7 → MnF3 + F2.

Balancing F: 7 =3 +2*1 → 5. No, that doesn't balance. So perhaps another product.

Alternatively, MnF7 → MnF4 + F2.

So:

Left side: MnF7 → Right: MnF4 + F2.

F:7 →4 + 2*1 →6. So, we need more F on the right. Let me find a balanced equation.

Let me write:

MnF7 → MnF3 + 2 F2.

F:7 →3 +4 →7. Okay, that works.

So the balanced reaction is MnF7 → MnF3 + 2 F2.

But wait, that would require 1 MnF7 → 1 MnF3 + 2 F2. Let me check the Mn balance: 1 →1. F:7 →3 +4=7. So yes, that's balanced.

So if A1 is MnF7, then A2 is MnF3.

Now, what's the fluorine percentage in MnF3?

Mn has atomic weight about 54.94.

MnF3: 54.94 +3*19=54.94 +57=111.94 g/mol.

Fluorine percentage: (57/111.94)*100 ≈50.9%. Hmm, but the question states 31.96%. That doesn't match. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, maybe A1 is a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is ClF3. ClF3 is a yellow-green liquid. When it decomposes, it produces ClF and F2. Let me see:

ClF3 → ClF + F2.

Balancing F:3 →1 +2 →3. Cl:1 →1.

So the reaction is ClF3 → ClF + F2.

But ClF is a diatomic molecule? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps ClF3 decomposes into F2 and Cl.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think of the fluorine percentage in ClF. Cl is 35.5, F is 19. So ClF has molecular weight 54.5. F% is 19/54.5≈34.88%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, not exact but close.

Wait, the problem states 31.96% which is exactly 32%. Let me think, 32% F implies that the molar ratio of F is such that 19x/(Y +19x) =0.32.

So, 19x/(Y +19x) =0.32 → 19x=0.32(Y +19x) → 19x=0.32Y +6.08x →19x -6.08x=0.32Y →12.92x =0.32Y → Y= (12.92/0.32)x →≈40.375 x.

So, for x=1: Y≈40.375 → no element. x=2: Y≈80.75 → which is close to Br (79.9). x=4: Y= 161.5 → no element.

Hmm, perhaps Y is bromine and A2 is BrF2? But earlier calculation when Y is Br, A2 as BrF2 would be 38/(79.9 +38)=38/117.9≈32.2%. Close to 32%. So that could fit.

So, if Y is Br, and A2 is BrF2, then the fluorine percentage is 32.2%, which is close to 31.96%. So, perhaps that's acceptable.

So, Y is bromine.

Then, the five binary compounds would be BrF, BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, BrF5.

Wait, but I thought BrF and BrF2 might not be stable, but the question states that five are known, so perhaps they are considered.

So, Y is Br.

Now, going back to A1. If Y is Br, then A1 is a bright red compound that decomposes into BrF2 (A2) and F2.

Wait, so the decomposition reaction would be something like BrF5 → BrF2 + F2.

Wait, let me check:

BrF5 → BrF2 + F2.

Fluorine atoms:5 →2 +4 →6. Not balanced. So perhaps the equation needs coefficients.

Let me write the balanced equation:

BrF5 → BrF2 + F2.

Let's balance F:5 on left. On right: 2 + 2*1=4.

So, need more F on the right. Let's try 2 BrF5 → 2 BrF2 + 3 F2.

Now, F: 2*5=10 on left. Right: 2*2 +3*2=4 +6=10. Balanced.

So the reaction is:

2 BrF5 → 2 BrF2 + 3 F2.

So A1 is BrF5, which decomposes into BrF2 (A2) and F2.

Now, does BrF5 have a bright red color? I'm not certain, but perhaps in some form it does.

Next, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br) and can interact with xenon. So, A3 is another fluoride, perhaps a higher one like BrF3.

Then, the part about adding Y (Br) to a hot, concentrated colorless solution of A4. The solution is colorless and concentrated, which makes me think of hydrofluoric acid (HF), but A4 is a binary compound of Br and F, so perhaps it's a bromide fluoride, like BrF3.

Wait, but the solution is colorless, so maybe A4 is HBrF2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of BrF3 in some solvent. Hmm.

Wait, when you add Br metal to a solution of A4, which is a binary Br-F compound, and in 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Wait, perhaps A4 is BrF3. Adding Br metal (Br2) in a 1:1 ratio? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is HBrF2 or another compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is BrF4^- in a solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of Y (Br) with a solution of A4 produces A5, which decomposes in water.

If A4 is BrF3, and Br is added, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. Or maybe it's a reaction where Br displaces F.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a bromide salt, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps A4 is HBrO (hypobromous acid), but that's not a binary compound with F. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A4 is a solution of BrF3. When you add Br metal, perhaps it does nothing, but maybe it's a redox reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about what A5 could be.

When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. Perhaps it's a fluoride that hydrolyzes. For example, if A5 is BrF5, then in water, it would hydrolyze to HBrO2 and HF or something. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is BrF3, which would hydrolyze into HBrO and HF. Or maybe BrF5 decomposes into BrF3 and F2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the initial part, A1 is BrF5, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2.

So, A4 is a solution of BrF3 perhaps. Adding Br metal in a 1:1 molar ratio to BrF3 could produce some reaction, maybe a displacement, but I'm not sure what that would yield.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound, like HBrF2, but that's a triply bonded compound, which is not a binary compound of Br and F.

Wait, perhaps A4 is BrF4, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think of A4 as a different compound. Let's say A4 is HBrF2. When Br metal is added, perhaps nothing happens because HBrF2 is a weak acid and Br is not reactive enough under those conditions. Alternatively, perhaps a reaction occurs to form HBr and HF. But that would require more analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of BrF3 in HF. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think of the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is Br (atomic weight ≈80), and A4 is a binary compound with F, what would its molecular weight be?

Possible options: BrF2 (80 + 38 = 118), BrF3 (80 +57=137), BrF4 (80 +76=156), BrF5 (80 +95=175).

Looking at the options given, the possible ranges are 110-130 (option D), 140-160 (option A), 160-180 (option C), and 220-240 (option B).

So, BrF4 would have a molecular weight of 156, which falls into option A (140-160). BrF3 is 137, which is in option C (160-180 is higher than 137). Wait, no, 137 is in option C if the lower end is 160, but 137 is below that. So that's in option D (110-130). Hmm.

Wait, BrF3 is 137 g/mol, which is within the range 110-130 plus a bit. So it's in option D. BrF4 is 156, which is in option A (140-160).

But earlier, I thought A4 is a solution, perhaps of BrF3. If A4 is BrF3, then its molecular weight is 137, which would fall into option D (110-130). But wait, 137 is above 130, so it's outside option D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is BrF4, which is 156, in option A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In the problem, when Y (Br) is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. Let's say A4 is BrF3. Adding Br metal may not react, as BrF3 is a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is HBrF2. The molecular weight would be H (1) + Br (80) + F2 (38) → 120. Hmm, that's 120, which is in option D (110-130).

But HBrF2 is a binary compound of H, Br, and F, which is not a binary compound of Br and F only. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think that A4 is BrF3, which has a molecular weight of 137, which is in the range 110-130 (option D) is 110-130. 137 is just above 130, so it's outside. So perhaps the correct range is option A (140-160), which would be BrF4 (156) or BrF5 (175).

Wait, but BrF5 is 175, which is in option C (160-180). So if A4 is BrF5, the molecular weight would fall into option C.

But earlier, I thought that A1 is BrF5, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2. So if A4 is another compound, perhaps BrF4, which has 156 g/mol, that falls into option A (140-160).

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the other parts.

A3 can interact with xenon. So A3 is a fluorinating agent. If Y is Br, then A3 could be BrF3, which is a strong fluorinating agent.

When BrF3 is added to xenon, it might react to form XeF2, XeF4, etc. So that fits.

So, perhaps A4 is BrF4, which has a molecular weight of 156. So that would fall into option A (140-160). Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3, the molecular weight is 137, which is just above option D's upper limit of 130. So perhaps the correct option is A.

But the question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls.

Wait, the options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130.

So, BrF4 is 156 → option A.

BrF3 is 137 → option D.

But which one is it? Given the problem's information, perhaps A4 is BrF4.

Thus, the molecular weight would be approximately 156, which falls into option A (140-160).


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine with element Y. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Identifying Element Y**:  
   - The problem states that there are five binary compounds of fluorine with Y. Elements like chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus were considered, but bromine (Br) emerged as the most plausible candidate. Bromine forms five binary fluorides: BrF, BrF2, BrF3, BrF4, and BrF5, fitting the requirement.

2. **Analyzing A1 and A2**:  
   - A1 is described as a bright red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine) and F2. Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) was identified as a likely candidate for A1. Its decomposition reaction is:  
     \[
     2 \, \text{BrF}_5 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{BrF}_2 + 3 \, \text{F}_2
     \]  
     This makes A2 = BrF2, which has a fluorine percentage of approximately 32%, close to the given 31.96%.

3. **Determining A4**:  
   - A4 is a binary compound of bromine and fluorine. Possible candidates include BrF2 (molecular weight = 118), BrF3 (137), BrF4 (156), and BrF5 (175).  
   - The molecular weight of A4 must fall into one of the given ranges:  
     - A) 140-160  
     - B) 220-240  
     - C) 160-180  
     - D) 110-130  

4. **Final Selection**:  
   - BrF3 has a molecular weight of 137, which is just above the upper limit of option D (110-130).  
   - BrF4 has a molecular weight of 156, which falls directly into option A (140-160).  
   - BrF5 has a molecular weight of 175, which falls into option C (160-180).  
   - Based on the context and the decomposition reactions, BrF4 is the most likely candidate for A4, as it aligns with the given data and the molecular weight range.

**Answer: A**
