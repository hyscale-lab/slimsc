Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that observations of a quasar are being made in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops a lot below that. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, emission lines are a big deal. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but when the universe expands, the wavelength stretchesâ€”redshift. So if we see Lyman-alpha at a longer wavelength, that suggests the quasar is redshifted.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman-alpha line is normally at about 121 nm, right? That's in the far UV. But here, the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. So if the observed wavelength is longer, that means the quasar is moving away from us, so high redshift. Let me calculate the redshift z.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 nm / 121 nm. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121. Hmm, 121 * 6 is 726, which is less than 790. 121 * 6.5 is 786.5. Close to 790. So about 6.
