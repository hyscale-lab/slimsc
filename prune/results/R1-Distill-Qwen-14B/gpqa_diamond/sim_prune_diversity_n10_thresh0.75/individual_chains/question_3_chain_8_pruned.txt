Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator involving sigma_z and sigma_x for a given spin-half particle state.

Alright, first, let me read the problem again. The particle is in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The operators are σ_z and σ_x, and the question is about the expectation value of 10σ_z + 5σ_x.

Hmm, so I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. Since we're dealing with a linear combination of σ_z and σ_x, I can probably compute the expectation values of each separately and then combine them.

Wait, the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩. Right, that makes sense because expectation values are linear.

So I need to find ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ for the given state.

Let's think about the state. The state is given as 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Wait a minute, let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good.

Now, σ_z is the Pauli z matrix. The eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So when σ_z acts on |↑⟩, it gives |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it gives -|↓⟩.

So the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is the probability of |↑⟩ multiplied by +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ multiplied by -1.

The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (3/4) =
