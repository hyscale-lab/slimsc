Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. Let's see, the reactions are happening in a sequence, so I need to follow each step carefully.

First step: cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm. Bromine usually adds to double bonds. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation? Or perhaps a dihydroxylation? No, wait, adding bromine to a ketone. Oh, wait, maybe it's a halogenation via the enol mechanism. Oh right! The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction adds bromine to the alpha carbon. So cyclohexanone would undergo alpha-bromination.

So, when cyclohexanone (which has six carbons in the ring, with a ketone group) reacts with bromine (Br2), it would add a bromine atom to the alpha position. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl group. In cyclohexanone, there are two alpha carbons: the two CH2 groups next to the carbonyl. So the product 1 would be 2-bromocyclohexanone. Wait, but wait: maybe more than one bromine? No, the reaction usually adds one equivalent of Br2, so I think product 1 is a mono-brominated cyclohexanone, specifically at the alpha position.

Next, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2. Heating with NaOH... that sounds like elimination. Since product 1 is a bromide, elimination would form an alkene. So, when 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with NaOH, it should undergo elimination, probably an E2 mechanism, removing H and Br to form a double bond. The position of the double bond would be between the alpha carbons. So product 2 would be cyclohexene. Wait, but wait, the starting material is 2-bromocyclohexanone. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (O) and a
