Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to determine the major products based on the given reagents. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for both A and B.

Starting with Reaction A:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. THF is a solvent, and I think KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ at the end probably refers to an acidic workup.

Wait, wait. Wait, spiro compounds... Spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, it's a spiro compound with two rings: one is a 3-membered ring (maybe cyclopropane?) and a 5-membered ring, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is spiro[3.5]non... Let me draw it mentally. Spiro compounds have two rings joined by a single atom. So, for spiro[m.n] something, m and n are the number of carbons in each ring. So, in this case, it's a 3-ring and a 5-ring, right? Non means nine carbons in total. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a bridge between two rings.

The starting alcohol is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the spiro center. The structure would be something like a cyclopropane connected to a cyclopentene or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The reagent is KH (potassium hydride) in THF. Then H+ is added. Usually, when an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KOtBu or LDA, it deprotonates to form an alkoxide. But with KH, which is a strong base, maybe it's abstracting a proton somewhere else.

Wait, wait, wait. The starting material is an enol. So, it's an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. The functional groups here are a spiro structure, a vinyl group, and an alcohol. So, the reaction conditions with a strong base might lead to elimination or
