Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the Pauli exclusion principle in this context. I think it's related to the symmetry of the wavefunction under exchange of identical particles. Since nucleons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the product's symmetry should be antisymmetric overall.

In the problem, the initial state is a 1S0 state. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 (since S=0 gives 2*0+1=1), L is 0 (since S is the orbital part, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, and J=0. Because 1S0 is a singlet state with zero orbital angular momentum. That makes sense because S=0 implies spin singlet, and L=0 is s-wave.

The system emits a particle X (let's say it's a pion or something), and the final state is NN (the two nucleons) in some state. The problem states that T(NN) is 0. So the isospin of the two nucleons is 0.

Wait, the initial state is a bound NN system. So I think the initial state (before emission) is in a certain isospin state. But when they emit X, the NN pair must adjust their quantum numbers accordingly.

The problem says that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin is zero, meaning it's in the singlet state for isospin. So their isospin wavefunction must be antisymmetric because for identical fermions, the overall wavefunction (which includes isospin, spatial, and
