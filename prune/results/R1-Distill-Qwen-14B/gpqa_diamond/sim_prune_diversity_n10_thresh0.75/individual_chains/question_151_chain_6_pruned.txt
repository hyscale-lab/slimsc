Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, does that mean it's a 3x1 matrix? Because there are three elements. So the state vector is a 3-dimensional vector. Got it.

The observable is represented by matrix P. The description says P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that down to visualize it better. So matrix P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, so each row has three elements. It's a 3x3 matrix. 

The question is to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of matrix P because the possible measurement results are those eigenvalues.

So, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

Let me write P - λI:

Row 1: [ -λ , 1/√2, 0 ]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Now, I need to calculate the determinant of this matrix and set it to zero.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed.

The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So, applying this to our (P - λI) matrix:

a = -λ, b = 1/√2, c = 0
d = 1/√2, e = -λ, f = 1/√2
g = 0, h = 1/√2, i = -λ

So determinant D is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) − (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- 1/√2 [ (1/√2)(-λ) − (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
+ 0 [ ... ] (the third term will be zero because c is zero)

Wait, let me compute each part carefully.

First term: a*(e*i - f*h)
Which is -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ]
Simplify
