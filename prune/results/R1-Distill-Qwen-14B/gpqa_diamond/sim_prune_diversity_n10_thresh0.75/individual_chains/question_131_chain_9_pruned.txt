Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. Let me read through the problem again and try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two carbons at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two productsâ€”major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The 2D NOESY NMR of the major has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected in the major product's NOESY.

Let me start by understanding the initial steps. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, so when it's dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride. The structure of the anhydride probably depends on the position of the double bond. But wait, the problem says the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons in the aromatic region are equivalent. Hmm, but wait, 7 ppm is usually for aromatic protons. But when would an anhydride have aromatic protons? Oh, wait, maybe the anhydride isn't aromatic, but maybe the dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting acid has two carboxylic acid groups and a cis-alkene, so when dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated double bond. So the anhydride would have an alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydride structure. Because that structure can have a conjugated system. So the structure would look like a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Looking at the 1H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. But wait, alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydrides typically have vinylic protons. Those protons usually resonate around 5-7 ppm. However, a single peak suggests that all the vinylic protons are equivalent. How can that happen? Maybe the structure is such that the two vinylic protons are equivalent due to symmetry. For example, in a five-membered ring anhydride, the two vinylic protons might be on adjacent carbons but equivalent due to ring symmetry.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows two peaks for carbons: 137 ppm and 165 ppm
