Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their magnetic moments related to their spin. The question is about what happens when the magnetic field direction changes suddenly.

Let me read it again. The particle's magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. Then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is mu = gamma * S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect, right? The energy is proportional to S_z times B. But when the field is changed to Y, the system's Hamiltonian changes.

After the field is switched, the particle is now in a magnetic field along Y. But the state of the particle was an eigenstate of S_z before the switch. So after the switch, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which now depends on S_y.

I think the time evolution of the system's state will cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. The frequency of these oscillations would relate to the energy difference between states.

Wait, so the initial state is |+z>, because the magnetic moment is aligned along +Z. When the field is along Y, the new Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y. The energy eigenstates for S_y are |+y> and |-y> with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2 times gamma B, perhaps.

Wait, the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y would be H = -mu·B. Since mu = gamma S, so H = -gamma B S_y (since the field is along Y).

But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is E = -mu · B. So H = -gamma S · B.

In this case, B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y. So the eigenvalues of H are plus and minus (gamma B * (ħ/2)) ), but wait, I might be mixing up units here. Let me think: S is in units of ħ/2, so S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 * something?

Wait, the spin operator S
