Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The idea is to mutate this gene using EMS to get rid of the compound. They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area.

The question is asking which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The options are mutants 1 through 4, and the options are A to D. 

First, I remember that the gene's structure has exons and introns. Exons are the coding regions, so mutations there can affect the protein produced. Introns are non-coding and spliced out, so mutations there might not have as much effect unless they're in a splice site, but that's a different issue.

The question is about the function of the gene product. If the gene makes a compound that's bad, we want to mutate it so it doesn't produce the compound. That would probably mean disrupting the gene's function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein structure so it doesn't work.

Now, looking at the sequences. The intact gene is given, and each mutant has a change in the first exon. So I need to compare each mutant's sequence to the wild type to see what kind of mutations occurred.

The wild type is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part: the wild type has "TTTCTCGC", and mutant 1 has "TTCTACGC". Wait, let me count the letters. Wait, the first part for wild type is ATG TTT C TCG C TGG...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up more carefully.

Let me write the wild type and mutant 1 sequences for the first part:

Wild type: ATG TTT C TCG C TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAA...
Mutant 1:    ATG TTT C TAC G C TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, so at position where wild type has a C (third position after ATG), mutant 1 has C, then the next part: wild type is TCG C, mutant 1 is TAC G.

Wait, perhaps the exact change is that in wild type, there's a C followed by TCG, and in mutant 1, it's C followed by TAC.

Hmm, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Let's compare each mutant.

I'll write each mutant's sequence and see where the change is from the wild type.

Wild type starts with 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT G...

Wait, perhaps I should compare each nucleotide.

Looking at the first part of each mutant:

Mutant 1:
Compare to wild type. Let me see:

Wild type: ATG TTT C TCG C TGG TAC T...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT C TAC G C TGG TAC T...

So, the fourth and fifth nucleotides after the start (ATG) are TTT in wild and TTT in mutant 1. Then, the next is C in both. Then, in wild, it's C TCG C, so the next part is CTCG. In mutant 1, it's CTAC. So the third codon in wild is CTC (which is Ser), and in mutant 1, it's TAC (which is Tyr). Wait,
