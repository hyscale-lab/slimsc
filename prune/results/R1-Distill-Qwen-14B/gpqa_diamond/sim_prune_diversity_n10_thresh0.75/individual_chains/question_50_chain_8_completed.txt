Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled terms next to it: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the task is to find out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the superficial degree of divergence, but I'm not too clear on the exact formula. Oh right, in a loop integral, the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated using the formula D = 4 - L, where L is the number of loops? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get that right.

Wait no, I think the general formula for the superficial degree of divergence in a Feynman diagram is D = 4L - (I think it's E for the number of propagators? Or maybe it's another factor). Wait no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the scaling with energy. Each loop contributes a certain number of integrals, which would relate to powers of a momentum scale.

Alternatively, I remember that each loop in a Feynman diagram brings in factors of the loop momentum, which in terms of dimensional analysis, would contribute to the scaling of the amplitude with the energy scale.

Wait, another approach: the overall scaling of the amplitude with the energy scale Q can give us the number of loops. Because each loop typically introduces a logarithmic dependence or maybe a power law. Let's consider the term (Q/M)^2. So, M is probably the mass scale, and Q is the energy scale of the process.

In a loop calculation, the integrals often lead to divergences that are regulated by a cutoff scale Λ. Alternatively, when you renormalize, the dependence on the renormalization scale μ comes into play. But here, the term is (Q/M)^2, which suggests that the amplitude scales as Q^2 over M^2. So for each loop, perhaps the dependence would be something like (Q)^{something}.

Wait, but how does the number of loops relate to the power of Q? Let me think. Each loop integral usually adds a certain power of the loop momentum, but since loop integrals in four dimensions (as it's four-dimensional spacetime here) can lead to logarithmic divergences for certain topologies, perhaps the overall scaling can be tied to the number of loops.

Wait, maybe I should think about the dimensions. The term (Q/M)^2 implies that it's dimensionless, because Q and M would have the same dimension (mass). So that term is just a ratio squared.

But how does this relate to the number of loops? Let's think about the possible factors. The given expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Wait, but let's think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a Feynman diagram with L loops, N propagators, and V vertices, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4L - (2V - E), where E is the number of external lines? Or wait, maybe another formula. Alternatively, the formula might be D = 4 - (E + something), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: in a loop expansion, each loop contributes a factor of the coupling constant raised to some power. For example, in QED, each photon propagator contributes a factor, but in the case of a Feynman diagram with L loops, the number of vertices would be proportional to L. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps in terms of the loop expansion, the amplitude's dependence on the coupling constants can indicate the number of loops. Let's see: the given expression has alpha^3 and g^2. I think in QED, alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi). And in Yang-Mills theories, the coupling is g, and the structure is similar but with more vertices.

But how does that tie into the number of loops? Let's think about the overall scaling in terms of perturbation theory. A one-loop diagram would have certain powers of the coupling constants, and higher loops would have higher powers.

Wait, for example, in QED, the one-loop correction to the electron propagator (the self-energy) has a term proportional to alpha. The two-loop correction would have alpha squared, and so on. So the power of the coupling (like alpha) would correspond to the number of loops. So if the expression has alpha cubed times g squared, that's (alpha^3)(g^2). So how many loops would that imply?

Wait, but wait: each vertex in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the coupling. For example, in QED, each photon vertex has a factor of e (or sqrt(alpha)), and the number of vertices in a diagram is related to the number of loops.

Wait, perhaps the number of vertices V is related to the number of loops L. For a connected diagram, the relation is L = (V + N - 1)/2, where N is the number of propagators. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the formula could be D = 4L - (I - E), where I is the number of internal lines. But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Another way: Each loop contributes a factor of (4π)^{-something} due to the integration over loop momenta. In the given expression, there is a 1/(4pi)^6 factor. So if each loop brings a 1/(4pi)^something, maybe the exponent can tell us the number of loops.

Wait, the denominator is (4pi)^6. So 6 is the exponent. How many loops would lead to 6 factors of 4pi in the denominator? If each loop contributes a certain number, say, each loop gives 4pi in the denominator from the integration measure, then 6 would come from 3 loops. Because each loop would contribute 4pi in the denominator, perhaps from the measure d^4k/(2pi)^4, which in dimensional regularization becomes factors of 4pi.

Wait, when calculating loop integrals, the typical integral in four dimensions would produce a factor involving 4pi from the volume element. For example, after integrating over the loop momentum, you often get a factor like (4pi)^2 from the integral, depending on the dimension. Wait, but in four dimensions, each loop would contribute a (4pi)^2 factor from the integration measure. Wait, no, because the loop momentum integral in four dimensions is d^4k/(2pi)^4, which is (2pi)^4 in the denominator. So when you perform the integral, the 2pi factors from each momentum integral contribute, but I'm not exactly sure how that plays out in the final expression.

Alternatively, perhaps each loop contributes a 1/(4pi)^d factor, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, but the spacetime here is four-dimensional, so d=4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering dimensional analysis, the given expression has (4pi)^6 in the denominator. If each loop contributes a 4pi factor, then 6 would imply 3 loops. Because 3 loops would contribute 3 factors, but wait the exponent is 6. Oh, wait, maybe each loop contributes two factors of 4pi. For example, in a loop integral, you might have a 4pi from the measure and another from somewhere else, like a coupling or a propagator. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^epsilon, where epsilon is the dimensional regularization parameter. But that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, think of the (4pi)^6 factor as coming from the product of loop integrals. Each loop might bring in a (4pi)^2 factor. So for 6, that would be 3 loops (because 3 x 2 =6).

Wait, let me think: in a loop integral, the integral over d^4k would give a result involving (4pi)^2, perhaps from the volume element in four dimensions. So each loop would have a factor of (4pi)^2 in the denominator, coming from the integral. So for example, a one-loop integral would give 1/(4pi)^2, a two-loop would give 1/(4pi)^4, etc. But the given denominator is (4pi)^6, so that would be three loops. Because 3 loops times 2 each gives 6.

Wait, but wait: let's think of the general structure. For a loop integral in four dimensions, the typical integral might be something like ∫d^4k/(2pi)^4 [something], which after evaluation (say, using dimensional regularization or another method), gives a factor proportional to (4pi)^{2 - epsilon}, but I'm not certain.

But in the given term, the denominator is (4pi)^6. If each loop contributes a (4pi)^2 to the denominator, then 6 would mean 3 loops. So the number of loops is 3.

But wait, in the given term, the denominator is 1/(4pi)^6, which is (4pi)^{-6}. So if each loop contributes a (4pi)^{-2}, then 3 loops would give (4pi)^{-6}, so yes, that would fit.

So the number of loops would be 3.

Looking at the options, option D is 3. So the answer should be D) 3.


To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Contribution to \(4\pi\):**  
   Each loop in a Feynman diagram typically contributes a factor of \((4\pi)^{-2}\) to the denominator due to the integration over loop momenta. For example:
   - A single loop contributes \((4\pi)^{-2}\),
   - Two loops contribute \((4\pi)^{-4}\),
   - Three loops contribute \((4\pi)^{-6}\).

2. **Denominator in the Expression:**  
   The given expression has a factor of \((4\pi)^{-6}\), which matches the contribution from three loops. This is because each loop contributes \((4\pi)^{-2}\), and three loops collectively contribute \((4\pi)^{-6}\).

3. **Energy Scale Dependence:**  
   The term \((Q/M)^2\) suggests a scaling with the energy scale \(Q\), but this does not directly affect the determination of the number of loops, which is already indicated by the \((4\pi)^{-6}\) factor.

### Conclusion:
The presence of \((4\pi)^{-6}\) in the denominator confirms that the Feynman diagram contains **three loops**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
