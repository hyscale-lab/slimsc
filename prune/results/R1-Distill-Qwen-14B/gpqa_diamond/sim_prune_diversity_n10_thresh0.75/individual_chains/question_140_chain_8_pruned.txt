Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack all the information given.

First, the problem is about a substance X reacting with another liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Finally, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its close analog.

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are given as A to D, with numbers 35, 25, 31, 29.

Let me break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, each atom contributes to the total number of protons and neutrons.

If W is a gas, possible candidates are H2, O2, N2, maybe CO2, but wait, CO2 would have 22 neutrons and 22 protons? Let me check. CO2 is a molecule with one C and two O atoms. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So total protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons (since Carbon-12 is common), each O has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait, that's equal! So CO2 is a possibility. But wait, the molecule's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So another possibility is H2O. H2O has 2 H (1 proton each) and 1 O (8). So total protons: 2. Neutrons: O has 8, so 8. So 2 vs 8, not equal. Not matching. So CO2 is a better fit.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about CH4? Let's see. CH4 has 6 protons (C) and 4*(1) =4 from H. So total protons=6+4=10. Neutrons: C has 6, each H has 0. So total neutrons=6. 10 vs 6, not equal. So no. How about CO? CO has 6 (C) + 8 (O) =14 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8, total 14. So CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That could fit. But, CO is a gas, but is it a molecule that's released in the reaction? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So the entire molecule's total protons equals total neutrons.

So for CO, 6+8
