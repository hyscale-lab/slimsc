Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right? They orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems based on their radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem says there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses. The period for system_1 is 2 years, and for system_2, it's 1 year. These periods are the time between two primary eclipses, which I think means the orbital period. So the orbital period is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2.

Next, the radial velocity (RV) observations: in system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. Wait, RV amplitude is the maximum change in radial velocity of each star due to their mutual orbit. So each star in the binary system has its own RV curve, and the amplitudes are related to their masses.

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving less. The less massive star moves more. So for system_1, one star has a higher RV (10 km/s) and the other lower (5). So the higher RV star is the less massive one, and vice versa. Same for system_2.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, what's the formula here? Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula that relates the masses and the orbital period and the velocities.

Wait, the formula is for the mass function. The mass function for each star in a binary system is given by (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1 * P) / (2π G), where K1 is the amplitude of the RV curve for star 1. But wait, I might be mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the masses are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes.

Oh, right! In a binary system, the two stars orbit the common center of mass. So, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. The velocity is proportional to (2π a)/P. So, V1 = (2π a1)/P, similarly V2 = (2π a2)/P. Since a1/a2 = M2/M1 (from M1 a1 = M2 a2), so V1/V2 = M2/M1.

So, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes V1/V2 is equal to M2/M1. Let me see. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. Let's say V1 is 10, V2 is 5. Then V1/V2 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M1 = M2 / 2.

Wait, but that's the mass ratio. Wait, the mass ratio q is M2/M1
