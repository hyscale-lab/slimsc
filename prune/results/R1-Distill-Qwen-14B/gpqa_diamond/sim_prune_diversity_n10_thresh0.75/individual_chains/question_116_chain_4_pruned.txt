Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The problem starts with Compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting can give clues about the structure.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests maybe a CH2 group next to something that splits it into a triplet. Wait, what gives a triplet? If a CH2 is adjacent to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet because of the neighboring two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Oh, like maybe two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Let's think: if each CH2 is next to a CH2, each with two protons, that could split into a triplet. Wait, no, wait. For a triplet, the neighboring group must have two protons. So if we have a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each with two protons, that would split the signal into a triplet. Wait, but the 6H might be two methyl groups attached to a central CH2. So if the structure is (CH3)2CH-CH2-something, no, wait. Or maybe it's a neopentyl group? Neopentyl is 2,2-dimethylpropyl, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the 6H at 0.9 ppm is likely two methyl groups (each 3H), so maybe they're attached to a CH2. So like (CH3)2CH-CH2-something. Alternatively, maybe a cyclohexane derivative where the substituents are methyl groups.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is split by three neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait. Quartet has four peaks, which means each proton is adjacent to a group with three protons. Or wait, the splitting is based on neighboring groups. Let me think: the number of peaks equals n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons. So a quartet (4 peaks) would mean
