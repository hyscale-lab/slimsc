Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Alright, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I need to find the initial concentrations after dilution. When you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So original concentration is 0.05 M, and volume doubles. So the new concentration after dilution would be 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the acetic acid's volume increases. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Wait, but in the titration, we're adding NaOH. So for each point (25% and equivalence), I need to calculate the moles of NaOH added and see how it affects the solution.

Let me think about the equivalence point first because that's often easier. At equivalence, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially present. So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the problem is asking about the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point, not the volume. So at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate and excess water.

Wait, but the solution after equivalence is a buffer of sorts? No, at equivalence, it's just sodium acetate in solution. So the solution will be a solution of the salt of a weak acid (acetate) and a strong base (sodium), so it will be basic. The pH can be calculated using the Kb of acetate.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:
