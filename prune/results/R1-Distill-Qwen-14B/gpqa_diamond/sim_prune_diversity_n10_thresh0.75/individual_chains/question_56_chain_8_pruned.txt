Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me think. The state given is |3,0,0⟩, which is the 3s orbital. It decays to |1,0,0⟩, which is 1s.

Wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process. I remember that in dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 for each transition. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. But for each transition, right? So from l=0 in |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to l=1 because Δl can be +1. So from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 perhaps? Because the energy levels depend on n, so the electron can't go directly from n=3 to n=1 in one step because that's a Δn of 2, which is not allowed for a single dipole transition. So yeah, two steps: 3s → 2p → 1s.

Wait, but let me clarify. The hydrogen atom's energy levels are quantized, so transitions must follow these selection rules. So from l=0, the first transition must go to l=1 (because Δl=±1). So the first step is from |3,0
