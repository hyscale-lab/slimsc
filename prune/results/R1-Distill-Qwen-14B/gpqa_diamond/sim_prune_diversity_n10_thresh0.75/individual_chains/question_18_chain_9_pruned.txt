Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here because the question is about composition, which is more about chemical abundances than mass. Maybe the mass is a distractor or maybe it's relevant for something else, but I'll focus on the abundance data given.

The elemental abundances are given using something called the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not too familiar with how that affects the calculations here. Maybe it's more about the [X/Y] notation which I know is a logarithmic abundance scale. 

So the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
But wait, wait. Another way: [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by the solar value, right? So [Fe/H] = log ( (nFe/nH) / (nFe,nH_sun / nH_sun) ) )

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero because it's the reference. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe abundance is same as solar.

Wait, but the Sun's given data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Let me compute that.

So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5= 1e-5.

So for the Sun:
nFe/nH = 3.16e-5 → [Fe/H]_sun=0 by definition.
nMg/nH =1e-5 → [Mg/H]_sun=0.

Now, let's process each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → So (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → same as the Sun. So [Fe/H]=0 means the Fe abundance relative to H is same as the Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → This is [
