Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal and aligned along the z-axis. The question is about the radiation pattern and the power radiated at a specific angle. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the distribution of that radiation depends on the shape and the symmetry of the charge distribution.

The problem says the radiation zone's power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

Wait, the radiation from oscillating charges... I think it's related to the dipole radiation. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is symmetric and the power radiated varies with the angle. The maximum power is along the equator of the dipole, which is at theta = 90 degrees, and it goes as sin(theta) squared or something like that. Oh wait no, I think the dipole radiation pattern in the far zone is proportional to (sin theta)^2, but wait, isn't that for the electric field? Or is it the power that depends on that?

Wait, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the square of the electric field. So, if the electric field is proportional to sin(theta), then the power would be proportional to sin^2(theta). But wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern for the electric field is proportional to sin(theta), so the intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) would be proportional to sin^2(theta). But wait, wait, no. The intensity in dipole radiation actually goes as sin^2(theta), yes, so the maximum intensity is when theta is 90 degrees.

Wait, but the question here is about a spheroid charge distribution oscillating. Hmm, spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis. So maybe it's a dipole-like radiation, but perhaps the distribution is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrupole or higher, but I think for oscillating charges, the dominant radiation is dipole radiation, especially if the size is non-relativistic compared to the wavelength.

So, going back, the function f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. If it's a dipole, f(theta) would be proportional to sin^2(theta). Let's think about that.

The maximum power is A, so when does f(theta) reach its maximum? For a dipole, maximum at theta = 90 degrees. So at theta = 30 degrees, what's the fraction of A?

Wait, the maximum value of sin^2(theta) is 1 (at 90 degrees). So for theta = 30 degrees, sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So the power at 30 degrees is 0.25 times the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

But wait, wait, I thought the dipole's maximum is at 90 degrees. So if f(theta) is maximum there, then at theta = 30 degrees, the fraction would be (sin 30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 25% of A is the radiated power there.

So the first part of the answer, the fraction, should be 1/4, which is 0.25.

Now, the second part is about the form of f. The function f depends on lambda and theta. From my notes, the radiated power per unit solid angle (the intensity) for dipole radiation has a dependence
