Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha squared)).

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula for del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state and rho is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are typical for harmonic oscillator systems like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. So the state here is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

But wait, the relative entropy uses a reference Gaussian state. For the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, I've heard that sometimes the reference is taken as the closest Gaussian state in some sense, maybe the one with the same first and second moments. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact procedure here.

First, I should probably compute the density matrix rho for the given state. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is |psi><psi|. Let's write that out.

Given |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

So rho = |psi><psi| = [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / N^2.

But wait, the normalization N is given, so I can compute that first. Let's compute N.

Given phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. So sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. And exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5), which is approximately
