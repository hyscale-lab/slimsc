Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor itself is uncharged, meaning it has no net charge to begin with. Inside this cavity, there's a small spherical space, and within that, someone placed a small positive charge +q. Now, the setup is a bit specific: the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is some distance s away from the conductor's center. Oh, and the radius of the cavity is r, but r is less than R, the radius of the conductor.

The point we're interested in is P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from P to the conductor's center is L. But wait, the point P is also at a distance l from the center of the cavity. And the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

The question is asking about the electric field E at point P. The options given have different forms, so I need to figure out which one correctly describes the electric field.

Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Charges reside on the surface, and the electric field inside the conductor is zero. Also, when there's a cavity inside a conductor, any charges placed inside the cavity can induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we place a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? The inner surface of the conductor (the part that's the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have a charge of -q. That would cancel the electric field within the conductor material itself, right? Because the conductor must remain neutral overall.

But then, what about the outer surface? The conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance the inner surface's -q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q, which adds up to zero. That makes sense.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor due to its own charges. Since the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, the electric field outside should be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center. So the field outside the conductor at a point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²) because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but what about the point P being at a distance l from the cavity's center, and considering the angle theta? How does that come into play?

I think I need to model this. Let's consider the setup. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is inside it, with its center displaced by s from the conductor's center.

When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) has -
