Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using some genetic engineering techniques, but the overexpression isn't happening as expected. So, they're trying to figure out why.

The setup: They introduced a hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. Then, they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, they can't overexpress the protein. Now, looking at the construct's plus strand sequence, they noticed something's wrong.

The options are about possible issues causing the lack of protein expression. Let's think about each option.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, maybe the HA tag isn't correct. If there's a missense, the protein might not be recognized for purification. But does that prevent expression? I don't think so. The protein would still be made, but maybe not pulled down. But the question says they can't overexpress. So maybe the issue isn't the tag but something else.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a stop codon in the sequence, the ribosome would stop, leading to a truncated protein. But looking at the construct, does it have a stop codon? Let me check the sequence. Wait, the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. Let me parse that. Each codon is three letters. The last part is TGAGTGA. Hmm, wait, let me count. The very end is GAGTGA. GAG is a codon for Glu, and TGA is a stop codon. So the last codon is TGA, which is stop. Oh, so the construct ends with TGA, which would cause the ribosome to stop. But wait, the construct is the coding sequence, so maybe that's the issue.

Wait, but wait. The construct is in a plasmid, right? The coding sequence should start with ATG (the start codon) and end before the stop codon, so that when expressed, the protein can be read through. Because if the construct includes the stop codon, then the gene would end there, so the protein would terminate. But if the construct is supposed to be in frame, perhaps the plasmid includes a stop codon after the insert. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the construct's coding sequence includes a stop codon in the middle. But looking at the sequence, the last part is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. Oh, so that's a problem because that would terminate translation early.

Wait, but why would that happen? Because in the plasmid, the coding sequence should not have a stop codon in the middle, because the vector's own stop codon would be after the insert. So if the construct includes a stop, the protein would be truncated. So the construct has a TGA at the end, so when the ribosome comes, it stops, and the protein isn't expressed in full. But wait, the construct is the coding sequence for GADD45G with the HA tag. So perhaps the construct should not contain a stop codon. Because the vector would have its own stop downstream.

So if the gene insert includes a stop codon, the translation would terminate early, leading to no protein. Because the plasmid's promoter and RBS are before the insert, and then the insert ends with a stop, so the ribosome stops there, so the full-length protein isn't made. So why is the last codon TGA in the insert?

Wait, let me look again. The sequence ends with 'GAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'. Wait, the last part is TGA. So the last three are GAGTGA. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count from the end. The last part is '...GAGTGA'.

So, the sequence is:

...TGAGTGA.

So the last three are GAG (the 5' end of that), and then TGA. So the last codon would be TGA, right? So the last amino acid is a stop. So the construct's coding sequence ends with a stop codon. That would mean that the mRNA would have a stop codon, so when the ribosome comes across it, it stops
