Okay, so I need to solve this electron microscopy question. Let's try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum when an electron beam is applied. 

So, Mike designed a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles were still present. He measured the mean free path as λ1, which I think is under normal vacuum conditions, not considering the electron beam.

Then, when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed to λ2. The question is why λ2 is different from λ1. The options are A to D, so I have to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, what's the mean free path? The mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, it's longer because there are fewer molecules. But under ultra-high vacuum, the MFP would be very long because the pressure is so low.

But when the electron beam is on, what changes? Oh, right, in an electron microscope, the electron beam can interact with the gas molecules. I remember that electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or maybe even get excited or dissociated. That might increase the number of particles in the compartment because the gas molecules could break down into smaller fragments. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam isn't just about imaging but also causing some reactions.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it might cause gas molecules to be ionized. Because the electrons have high energy (1000 kV is a lot, so the electrons are moving really fast), when they collide with the gas molecules, they can knock electrons off the gas atoms, creating ions. So each gas molecule could split into ions and electrons, or perhaps create more charged particles.

But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, the mean free path depends on the number density of particles. If the gas molecules are ionized and the number of particles increases, then the MFP should decrease. Because more particles mean more collisions. So if λ1 is the MFP under normal vacuum, and after the beam, the number of particles increases, λ2 should be less than λ1.

Wait, but wait. The initial mean free path λ1 was determined under vacuum conditions
