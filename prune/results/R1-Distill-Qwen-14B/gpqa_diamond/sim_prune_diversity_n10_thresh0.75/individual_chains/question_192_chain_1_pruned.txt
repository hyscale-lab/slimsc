Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Hmm, the problem says we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, which is less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Wait, but wait, since the conductor's radius is R, the cavity can't be outside of it, so s must be smaller than R, right? Because if the cavity's center is at s distance from the conductor's center, and the conductor's radius is R, then s plus the cavity's radius r can't exceed R. Or maybe it's just that the cavity is entirely within the conductor, so s + r < R? Hmm, maybe that's not super important right now.

So, inside this cavity, someone placed a small positive charge +q. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Oh, but wait, since P is outside the conductor (which has radius R), L must be greater than R, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, which is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So, maybe l can be found using the law of cosines or something? Not sure if that's needed yet.

The angle between l and s is theta. So, the setup is such that the point P is somewhere outside, and the line from P to the cavity's center makes an angle theta with the line connecting the two centers (the conductor's center to the cavity's center).

Okay, the question is about the electric field E at point P. The options are various formulas involving these distances and the charge q.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Oh right, in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. Charges reside on the surface. But this is an uncharged conductor, right? So, if the conductor was initially neutral, placing a charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, so when you have a conductor with a cavity and place a charge inside, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to q because the conductor was initially neutral. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero. So, the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it, right? Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q. That makes sense.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor (which is where P is) would be due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface outside the conductor. So, that includes the charge on the outer surface, which is +q
