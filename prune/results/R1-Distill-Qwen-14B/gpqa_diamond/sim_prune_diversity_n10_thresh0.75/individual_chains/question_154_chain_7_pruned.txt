Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The chemist found a white solid, and we've got some spectral data to identify it. The options are A-D, each a different organic compound. Let me go through each piece of data.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at 158 at 32%. Hmm, wait, that might suggest something about the molecular formula. The molecular ion is usually the molecular weight, so 156 g/mol. But then there's a peak at 158. Oh, wait, that's 2 m/z higher. What could cause that? Maybe a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So, if the molecular ion is 156, and another peak is 158, which is two more, perhaps the molecule has a Cl atom.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and the other peak is 158. So, the molecular weight is either 156 or maybe the 156 is the base peak. Let me think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde (C7H6O) is 106 (C=12*7=84, H=6, O=16). But 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, because 2-hydroxy adds an OH, so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute that: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl) is about 35.5, 16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh, so the molecular weight would be about 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, perhaps if the Cl is 35Cl, the molecular ion would be at 156 (since 35.5 is average, but exact isotopes cause shifts). Alternatively, the molecular ion is the most abundant, but the 158 peak is 37Cl, so the molecular formula must include Cl.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156, but the next peak is 158, which is 2 higher. So, maybe the molecular formula has one Cl. Because 35Cl would make the molecular ion at 156, and 37Cl would make it 158. So
