Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a specific di-substituted aromatic compound. Hmm, let's break down the information given.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Because it's a di-substituted, that means two substituents attached to the ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl or Br attached to the ring). So the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl, and another is a halogen. So each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halide. Or could one substituent be a group that has both a carbonyl and a halogen? Hmm, but the question says the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So more likely, each substituent is a different group.

But wait, let me think. The carbonyl group could be part of a ketone or an ester or something else. Let's think about possible structures.

A di-substituted benzene with substituents being a carbonyl group and a halogen. But how? Oh wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like as an acyl group) and a halogen attached directly.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. For example, a substituent could be an acetyl group (CH2CO- attached to the ring) and another substituent could be a bromine or chlorine.

Wait, let's see: The molecular formula would be C8H? Let me think. Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent adds some carbons. Let's see, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, perhaps as a methyl ketone. Wait, but if the substituent is a carbonyl, say, like an acetyl group, which is C2O, attached to the ring as an acyl group (like acetophenone). Then the other substituent is a halogen, say, Cl or Br. So the structure would be something like Cl–C6H4–COCH3. Wait, but that would add (for COCH3) two carbons, and Cl is one substituent. So total carbons are 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 1 (Cl doesn't add a carbon). Wait, but that's 9 carbons, which doesn't match the given total of 8.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The compound has 8 carbons in total. So benzene (6 C) plus substituents. So the substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. Because 6+2=8.

So substituents need to add 2 carbons. So maybe one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) which doesn't add any carbons, and the other substituent is a methyl group with a carbonyl. Wait, but that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached via a single bond. For example, a ketone substituent like in acetophenone is a COCH3 group. That would add two carbons. So if the other substituent is a halogen (Cl, Br, I), which adds no carbons, then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That fits. So the structure would be, say, 4-chloroacetophenone. Or something like that.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a ketone and a chloro group in some positions on the benzene ring
