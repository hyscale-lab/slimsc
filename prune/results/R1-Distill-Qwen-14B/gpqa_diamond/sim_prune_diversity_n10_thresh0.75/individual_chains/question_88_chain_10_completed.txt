Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The setup is that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Then, they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They found the Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells, then sequenced the variable heavy chain genes which showed high variability.

Hmm, what's the question again? Oh right, which process is taking place that leads to this outcome.

Let me think about each part. So, Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens in the intestine. When rotavirus is ingested, the immune response is triggered there. The fact that the GFP-tagged proteins were destroyed by stomach acid and some got stuck in mucus suggests that not all of them made it through, but some did reach the Peyer's patches.

The key here is the sequencing result: high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability usually points to a process that generates diverse antibodies. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes to increase diversity.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination (D) is part of the initial diversity generation during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's about the combination of V, D, and J segments to create the variable region of the heavy chain. But this happens early on, in the bone marrow, not necessarily in response to an antigen after the B cell has been activated.

Somatic hypermutation (A) occurs after the B cell is activated by an antigen. It introduces point mutations in the variable region, leading to higher diversity among the antibodies produced. This process happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer's patches. So when the B cells are proliferating and mutating their variable regions, you'd see a high variability in the variable heavy chains.

Class switching recombination (C) changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't increase the variability of the antigen-binding site. It's more about the type of antibody produced, not the diversity of the specific receptors.

Complement activation (B) is part of the innate immune response and doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction.

So the question is about the high variability in the variable heavy chains after the B cells have been activated. That sounds like somatic hypermutation. Because in the Peyer's patches, the germinal centers are active, and during this process, B cells undergo hypermutation. The sequencing would show a lot of variation because each B cell is mutating its own variable region, leading to a diverse population.

Wait, but when you isolate the proliferating cells, their variable regions are diverse because each has undergone hypermutation. That makes sense. So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid, and some proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. In these patches, the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating B cells are sequenced, revealing high variability. This outcome is consistent with a process that generates diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies.

Analyzing the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D)** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to generate the variable region of the heavy chain. This process does not explain the observed high variability in the Peyer's patches, as it occurs before antigen exposure.

- **Somatic hypermutation (A)** is a process that introduces point mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors after antigen activation. This occurs in germinal centers, such as those found in Peyer's patches, and is responsible for generating diverse antibody specificities. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chains aligns with this process.

- **Class switching recombination (C)** changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase the diversity of the antigen-binding site. It is not relevant to the variability observed in the variable heavy chains.

- **Complement activation (B)** is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to the variability in the variable regions of antibodies.

The high variability in the variable heavy chains observed in the proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, as this process generates diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies after antigen exposure.

Answer: A
