Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Hmm. So I'm trying to figure out whether the compound is a propenyl or butenyl acetate, and whether it's cis or trans.

First, I should recall the structures of these compounds. Acetates are esters, so the general formula would be R-O-CO-R', where R' is usually an acetyl group (like CH3-CO-O-). So in these cases, R is derived from propene or butene.

Wait, propenyl acetate would have the structure where the acetyl is connected via an oxygen to a propenyl group. Similarly, butenyl acetate would have a butenyl group.

For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc or maybe CH2-OAc-CH2-CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, wait, propenyl groups can be either allyl type or perhaps substituted. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. But in the context of an acetate, the propenyl would be attached to the oxygen.

Wait, but the propenyl group in propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2CH2OAc? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Acetate is OAc- (O-CO-CH3), so when it's propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-CH3? Wait no, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Which is propenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that the propen
