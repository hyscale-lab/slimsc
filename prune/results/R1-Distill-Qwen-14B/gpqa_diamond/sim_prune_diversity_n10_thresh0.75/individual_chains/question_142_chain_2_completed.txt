Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that this looks familiar. Oh right, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the standard basis states for a qubit. So the density matrix is the average of the projectors onto these states.

Wait, what's the significance of this matrix? Oh, because each term |n⟩⟨n| is a projector onto the state |n⟩. And when you average them with equal weights (since each is multiplied by 1/2), this should represent a mixed state, right? So this is a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch sphere). So the state is represented by a point on the Bloch sphere, with r being the vector coordinates.

So in this case, our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute what this would be in terms of the Bloch vector. Let me write out the matrix form of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|.

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then we multiply by 1/2, so ρ is (1/2)I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

So ρ = I/2. Now, let's express this using the Bloch sphere formula. The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides, we get ρ - I/2 = (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. But since our ρ is I/2, subtracting I/2 gives zero. So the right side must be zero as well.

That implies that each of the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices, which are linearly independent. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. So the geometrical position is at the origin in the qubit space, which makes sense because the completely mixed state is in the middle of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we note that \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies that the terms involving the Pauli matrices vanish. This means \( r_x = r_y = r_z = 0 \), so the Bloch vector is at the origin, \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.
