Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), but wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me get it straight. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for the relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v) but multiplied by a factor because of the Lorentz factor. Or wait, no, it's (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the formula correctly.

Wait, the relativistic velocity addition formula is when you have two velocities u and v, and you want to find the velocity of one frame as seen from another. But in this case, the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So the formula for the relative velocity between them is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, if both are moving in the same direction, then v2 is the speed of the second astronaut, and v1 is the speed of the first as observed in the same frame. Wait, no, maybe the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the first object, and v is the speed of the second, but I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Let's say the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at speed u = 0.6c, and the second (3m) is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second? Or wait, no, wait. The problem is about the relative speed, but between which two? Oh, the problem says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." So I think the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. Or perhaps the relative velocity between them. Hmm.

Wait, but in relativity, the relative speed isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But I need to figure out which one is moving faster. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second astronaut is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c? But wait, no, that would be in the non-relativistic case. But since these are significant fractions of c, I can't do that.

So the correct formula for relative velocity when moving in the same direction is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). Let me plug in u as 0.6c and v as 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 → 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 → approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed would be approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c, so that's a match.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, or is it their total energy, including rest mass energy?

Wait, the question says "the total energy of the system." So I think it's the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. Or perhaps, considering they are moving, it's the sum of their total energies (rest energy plus kinetic). Or wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum of their energies as measured in the same frame.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Are we considering the total energy in the rest frame of the combined system, or the sum of their energies in their respective frames? Or perhaps the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies as measured in some frame?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of their relativistic energies as measured in the same reference frame, maybe the rest frame of the combined system or one of the astronauts.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem states that the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So perhaps we're considering each of their energies in the same frame, possibly the rest frame of one of them or the combined system. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's their energies in the same frame, perhaps the lab frame.

Wait, no, the question says "the total energy of the system." Hmm, but each astronaut's energy would include their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy in the same frame. So perhaps we should calculate each astronaut's total energy (gamma * m c²) and sum them.

So, for each astronaut, we calculate gamma and multiply by their rest mass.

So, for the first astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So their energy is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m at 0.5c): gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So their energy is 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 m c² ≈5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says 4.96. So the total energy would match option C or D. But wait, option C has 5.96 mc² and 0.14c, which matches the relative speed we calculated earlier.

So looking at the options, option C is v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe the total energy refers to the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies? Or is it the sum of their total energies (which includes rest and kinetic). Because the question says "total energy," which in relativity usually includes rest energy and kinetic.

So, yes, I think that's correct.

So the options are:

A) v_rel =1.1c, E= mc^2 → No, speeds can't exceed c.

B) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 → E seems lower than our calculation.

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 → Matches our calculation.

D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5 → Hmm, 5 is a round number, but our calculation was 5.96, so it's closer to option C.

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). The relative speed is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c \), \( E = mc^2 \) → Incorrect (speed exceeds \( c \), energy is too low).
- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c \), \( E = 4.96m c^2 \) → Incorrect (relative speed is too low).
- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \) → Correct.
- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5m c^2 \) → Incorrect (energy is too low).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
