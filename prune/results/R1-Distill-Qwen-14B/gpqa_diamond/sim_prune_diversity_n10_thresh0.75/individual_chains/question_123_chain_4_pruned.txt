Okay, so there's this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames of reference. Oh right, inertial frames are those where Newton's laws hold, and there's no acceleration. So no one is feeling any force or acceleration from their own perspective.

From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because if in one frame the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, the ejecta is moving the opposite way in the galaxy's frame. Or is that not correct? No, wait, actually, in special relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Wait, but maybe this is non-relativistic? The question doesn't specify, but the speed is 60,000 km/s. Let me check: the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So it's a significant fraction, but not ultra-relativistic. Hmm, but how does that affect things?

Wait, the problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I think this is about time dilation and length contraction, but maybe it's a Doppler effect issue?

Wait, no, maybe it's just a simple velocity and time problem, but considering the frame differences. Let me think. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. Time is passing, and we want to find out how far the ejecta travels in that time. But wait, no, the time is given in the ejecta's frame. So 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame to calculate the distance.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The ejecta's frame sees the Galaxy moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So the two frames are moving relative to each other at that speed. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at v =
