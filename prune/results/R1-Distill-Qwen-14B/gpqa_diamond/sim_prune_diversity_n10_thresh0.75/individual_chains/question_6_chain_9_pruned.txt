Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for central potentials, the energy levels depend on the effective potential and the angular momentum. Wait, but this potential doesn't look exactly like the simple harmonic oscillator or Coulomb potential. Let me think.

The potential V(r,θ) can be broken down into two parts: the first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh, wait, I think I can rewrite this. Maybe using some trigonometric identities or separation of variables.

Wait, in polar coordinates, sometimes it's useful to separate the radial and angular parts. So, let me consider the potential in terms of r and θ. The first term is purely radial, as it only depends on r. The second term also depends on r² but multiplied by cos²θ, which depends on θ.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, the effective potential for a particle in an oscillator potential plus some angular dependence might lead to a situation where the problem can be solved by treating each direction separately or looking for separation of variables in polar coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). Let me try substituting that in.

So, V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² +
