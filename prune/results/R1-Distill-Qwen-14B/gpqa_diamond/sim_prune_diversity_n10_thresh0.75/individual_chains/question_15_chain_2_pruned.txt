Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit based on the given information. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think it's related to the size of the planet compared to the star and the distance between them. Oh right, the formula for the probability (p) is something like p = (R_planet / R_star)² * (1/(e sin i))², but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so maybe that term isn't a factor. Or wait, no—wait, when the orbit is circular, the probability might just depend on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius. Hmm.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, but since we're dealing with the same planet-star system, maybe it's more about the alignment. Oh wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by the orbital distance. Or is it actually the other way around. Let me think.

I think the actual formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1/a), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, wait. I might be getting confused. Let me recall: the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but again, e is zero here because the orbits are circular. So it's (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1/(a)). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, I think I remember this differently. The transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/a). Because the longer the orbital distance (a), the less likely the planet is to pass in front of the star from our line of sight. Or is it the opposite? Let me think about it. The probability is higher when the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The formula I've seen is P = (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(a (1 - e²)^0.
