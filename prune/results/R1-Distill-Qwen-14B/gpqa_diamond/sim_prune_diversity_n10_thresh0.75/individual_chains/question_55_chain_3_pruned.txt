Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me an unknown organic compound and its 1H NMR data. The options are four different compounds: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. I need to figure out which one matches the NMR data.

First, let me write down the NMR data provided:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I remember that in acetates, like propenyl or butenyl acetates, the structure usually has an ester group. The ester's structure is OAc-O-CR2, where R can be different substituents. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl (ester group) might show up around 4-6 ppm, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but I think the protons on the double bond are more important here.

Looking at the options, all of them are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So they have a vinyl group (double bond) attached to the ester. The difference between cis and trans is the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond.

Let me think about each option's structure:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The structure would be CH2CH2COOAc? Wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH₂CH₂? No, maybe better to think in terms of the substituents on the double bond.

Wait, propenyl acetate would have the structure CH₂CH₂COOAc? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.

Actually, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂-, but when it's attached to the ester group, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc. Wait, no, acetate is OAc, so the ester would be OAc-O-R. So R is the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH₂CH₂COO something. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structures.

Wait, maybe the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH₂=CHCH₂OAc. Wait, but the ester would be R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, acetate ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-Me. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait, no. Wait, acetate ester is something like CH3CO-O-R. So if R is propenyl (CH₂CH₂CH₂?), but propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Acetate ester is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, no. Wait, no, the ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So, if the alcohol is propenyl alcohol, it would be CH₂CH₂CH₂-OH, but that's not right. Wait, propenyl alcohol is CH₂=CHCH₂OH, so when esterified with acetic acid, it becomes CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-OCH3? No, I think the correct structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-Me. Because the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is methyl (from acetic acid). So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂-O-CO-Me.

Wait, but in the NMR data, I
