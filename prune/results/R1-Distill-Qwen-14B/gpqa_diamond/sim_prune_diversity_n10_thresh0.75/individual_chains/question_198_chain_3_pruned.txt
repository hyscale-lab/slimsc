Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex. Wait, no—wait, the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2] maybe? Or is it the others? Wait, I recall that the color changes with different ligand numbers. Like, [Co(SCN)]+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, and higher ones are maybe green or something else. So the blue would be the dithiocyanato complex, which is the one with two SCN- ligands. So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex. Wait, but the problem says "dithiocyanato," which is two SCN ligands. So the complex we're looking for is the one with two SCN- ligands. 

The stability constant β2 is 40. Oh, wait, but the β values are for each step. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)_2, and so on. So the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 * β2 * ... up to βn. Or wait, wait, no. Stability constants are typically for each step. So the formation of the first complex, then the second, and so on. So the overall formation constant for the n-th complex is the product of the β's up to that point.

Wait, no, the stability constant for each complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the previous one. So, for example, the formation of [Co(SCN)]+ would have a β1 (the first step), then [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would have β2 (the second step), and so on. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be β1 * β2. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ would be β1 * β2 * β3, and [Co(SCN)_4]^3+ would be β1 * β2 * β3 * β4. Wait, but I'm not sure if the β's are cumulative or each step. Oh wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for adding another SCN- ion. So for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, β1=9. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, has β2=40, which is the equilibrium for [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^2
