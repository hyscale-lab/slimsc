Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n vectors. So H = ε · σ · n. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The notation is H = ε σ · n. Oh, right, the sigma vector is a vector of Pauli spin matrices. So, σ is (σx, σy, σz), and n is a unit vector, which means it's direction is arbitrary but has a magnitude of 1.

I remember that the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues of ±1. Or wait, no, each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination of them, like in this case, the result is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalues depend on the coefficients.

So, the setup is H = ε (σ · n) = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But how does that help me find the eigenvalues?

I think I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ, the eigenvalues are ±1. But when you have a combination like a·σ, where a is a vector, the eigenvalues of a·σ are ±|a|, right? Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and any linear combination with real coefficients is also Hermitian. The eigenvalues for a·σ would then be ± the magnitude of a. But wait, in this case, a is a vector with components (n_x, n_y, n_z), which is a unit vector. So the magnitude is 1, meaning a·σ would have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a second. Let's think about a·σ. Let me represent this as a 2x2 matrix. Suppose a is a unit vector, so a·σ is σ_x a_x + σ_y a_y + σ_z a_z. The trace of this matrix would be zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The determinant would be... Hmm, the determinant of a·σ. Each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but when you take a linear combination, it's a bit more involved. Alternatively, I can think of the eigenvalues. Since a·σ is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvalues. And for any unit vector a, a·σ squared is (a·σ)^2 = (a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, it's a_x^2 σ_x^2 + a_y^2 σ_y^2 + a_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2 a_x a_y σ_x σ_y + ... Hmm, but each σ_i^2 is the identity matrix I times 1. So, (a·σ)^2 = (a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) I + 2 (a_x a_y σ_x σ_y + a_x a_z σ_x σ_z + a_y a_z σ_y σ_z). But since σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k for i≠j, but the cross terms might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps an easier way is to realize that (a·σ)^2 = |a|^2 I, because when you square a vector in spin space, the cross terms cancel due to the anticommutation relations.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because if I take (a·σ) squared, that would be (a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z)(a_x σ_x
