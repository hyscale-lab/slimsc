Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, the dot product here means that we're taking the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix. So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, right? So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues λ satisfy det(H - λ I) = 0. But wait, Pauli matrices are traceless and their squares are identity matrices. Each Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, right?

Wait, so each σ_i² = I. So if we compute σ · n squared, that's (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) squared. Let me expand that. It would be n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + (n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_x σ_y σ_x + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z + n_z n_x σ_z σ_x + n_z n_y σ_z σ_y ). 

But wait, σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j, and σ_i² = I. So the cross terms involve the Pauli matrices multiplied together, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. 

Wait, the sum of the squares of the components of n is 1. So:

σ · n squared is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2 = n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z).

But each σ_i squared is the identity matrix I. So the first three terms are n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I = I, since n is unit.

The cross terms: σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, σ_x σ_z = -i σ_y, σ_y σ_z = i σ_x, and so on for other products. So each cross term will have factors involving i and the Pauli matrices. But when you sum all the cross terms multiplied by 2, maybe they end up contributing another term. Wait, wait. Let's see:

Each cross term like n_x n_y σ_x σ_y is n_x n_y i σ_z. Similarly, the term n_y n_x σ_y σ_x is n_y n_x (i σ_z) because σ_y σ_x = -σ_x σ_y = -i σ_z. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The product σ_i σ_j is i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j and j≠k, and ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. So each σ_i σ_j term for i≠j will involve another Pauli matrix.

But perhaps instead of expanding, I can consider that (σ ·n)^2 equals (n · σ)^2 = 1 * I, because each Pauli matrix is traceless and their squares are identity. Wait, wait, let me calculate (σ·n)^2. Since each component of sigma is a vector, and n is unit, the magnitude squared of σ·n would be (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2.

Wait, another approach: for any unit vector n, σ · n is a 2x2 matrix. The square of this matrix is (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + ... ) + cross terms. But each σ_i^2 is I, so the sum of n_i^2 σ_i^2 is I. The cross terms, like σ_x σ_y, are proportional to i σ_z, etc. But when you sum all these cross terms, I think the result is zero because for any unit vector n, the sum might end up being zero. Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms don't add up to zero, but maybe there's another way to compute (σ ·n)^2.

Wait, I read somewhere that (σ ·n)^2 equals I. Because for any unit vector n, the square of σ·n is the identity matrix. Let me check that.

Let me compute (σ·n)^2: each term is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, we get Σn_i² σ_i² + Σ_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

We already have Σn_i² σ_i² = Σn_i² I = I, because n is unit. Now the cross terms: the sum over i≠j of n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Each σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k. So the sum becomes i Σ_{i≠j} n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k. But wait, ε_ijk is antisymmetric under exchange of i and j. So when we sum over i and j, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that (σ·n)^2 = (Σn_i σ_i)^2 = Σn_i^2 σ_i^2 + Σ_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

We know that Σn_i^2 σ_i^2 = I. Now, the cross terms: for each pair (i,j), where i≠j, n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

But σ_i and σ_j anti-commute when i≠j. Because {σ_i, σ_j} = 0 when i≠j. So σ_i σ_j = -σ_j σ_i. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but perhaps the sum Σ_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j can be rewritten. Let's consider that:

Σ_{i<j} n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i) ) + Σ_{i≠j} n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j - σ_j σ_i ) / 2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe this sum is zero. Because for a unit vector n, perhaps the sum over the cross terms is zero. Let me think about a specific example. Let's take n along z-axis, so n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=1.

Then, (σ_z)^2 = I, and the cross terms would be zero because n_x and n_y are zero. So in this case, (σ_z)^2 = I. So it holds.

Another example: n = (1,0,0). Then σ·n = σ_x. (σ_x)^2 = I. So indeed, (σ_x)^2 = I. So the square is I regardless of the direction of n.

Therefore, (σ ·n)^2 = I. So that's a key point.

So, the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ ·n). So H squared is ε² (σ ·n)^2 = ε² I.

The eigenvalues of H must satisfy (H - λ I)(H + λ I) )= 0, since H^2 = ε² I. So H^2 = (λ)^2 I = ε² I => λ^2 = ε^2. So λ = ± ε. So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. H^2 = (ε σ·n)^2 = ε² (σ·n)^2 = ε² I. So the eigenvalues of H must satisfy λ^2 = ε². So λ = ±ε.

That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are involved, and their eigenvalues are ±1. So when scaled by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer should be B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with energy dimension, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the properties of the Pauli matrices and the Hamiltonian.

The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) expands as \(n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z\). Each Pauli matrix \(\sigma_i\) satisfies \(\sigma_i^2 = I\) (the identity matrix) and anti-commutes with the others, i.e., \(\{\sigma_i, \sigma_j\} = 0\) for \(i \neq j\). 

The square of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is:

\[
(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = n_x^2 \sigma_x^2 + n_y^2 \sigma_y^2 + n_z^2 \sigma_z^2 + 2(n_x n_y \sigma_x \sigma_y + n_x n_z \sigma_x \sigma_z + n_y n_z \sigma_y \sigma_z).
\]

Since \(\sigma_i^2 = I\), the first three terms sum to \(n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I = I\) because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector (\(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\)). The cross terms involve products of Pauli matrices, which are proportional to imaginary combinations of other Pauli matrices. However, these cross terms cancel out due to the symmetry of the problem, leaving \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\).

Thus, the Hamiltonian satisfies:

\[
H^2 = (\varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \varepsilon^2 I.
\]

The eigenvalues of \(H\) are the solutions to \(H^2 = \varepsilon^2 I\), which implies:

\[
\lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \pm \varepsilon.
\]

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**B) \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\)**.

Answer: B
