Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is written as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). So, I need to figure out where this particular ρ is located in the qubit space.

Wait, qubit space is a two-dimensional space, right? Because a qubit can be represented as a vector in a 2D Hilbert space. But wait, density matrices are 2x2 matrices, so the space they live in is the space of all 2x2 Hermitian matrices. Oh right, because density matrices must be Hermitian and positive semi-definite.

I think the geometry they're referring to is the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it can be written as a vector on the unit sphere in 3D space, where each component corresponds to the coefficients in the Bloch vector. But wait, density matrices are more general. So how does that apply here?

Oh right, any density matrix can be represented as a point in the 3D space, which is the Bloch sphere plus the axes. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a 3D vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So the equation becomes ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2. If I can express the given ρ in this form, then the coefficients x, y, z will give me the Bloch vector r.

Let's compute the given ρ first. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute each term.

|0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which is the matrix [[1, 0], [0, 0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]. Adding these together: [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] = [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2: [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

So ρ is the matrix diag(1/2, 1/2). Now, I need to express this in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]]. That's exactly ρ. Because when I expand I + r·σ, it becomes I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z, and then divided by 2.

Wait, wait. So ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me write out each term.

The Pauli matrices:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when I calculate r·σ, it's xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z. Let's compute this:

xσ_x = [[0, x],[x, 0]]
yσ_y = [[0, -iy],[iy, 0]]
zσ_z = [[z, 0],[0, -z]]

Adding these together gives:
[[z, x - iy], [x + iy, -z]]

Then (I + r·σ) is:
[[1 +
