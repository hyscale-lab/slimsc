Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that the initial atomic nucleus is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, right, so that's its rest energy, E=Mc². So M is the initial mass.

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let me denote the rest masses. Let the lighter fragment have rest mass m. Then the heavier one is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh right, because in reality, some mass might be converted into kinetic energy, but the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the heavier fragment has mass 2m = 0.66 M.

But wait, the initial nucleus was M. So the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So the rest mass energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. But the initial rest energy was 300 GeV. Oh, that means the total energy must add up correctly, considering kinetic energy.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total energy after fission must be the same as before, right? But wait, no, because in nuclear reactions, energy is released, but in this case, the problem states that the two fragments are the only products. So maybe the initial rest energy plus any binding energy is converted into rest mass and kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a conservation of energy and momentum problem. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta so that their total momentum is zero.

So, let me denote:

- Mass of fragment 1: m1 = 0.66 M (since it's twice the other)
- Mass of fragment 2: m2 = 0.33 M
- Let their velocities be v1 and v2, but since momentum must cancel, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (but with opposite directions; so perhaps m1 v1 (say, to the right) equals m2 v2 (to the left), so m1 v1 = m2 v2 in magnitude.

But in any case, the kinetic energies are (gamma-1) m c² / 2 for each, but wait, no—relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1) m c². But since I'm considering velocities, I probably need to use the relativistic expressions for momentum and energy.

Alternatively, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies, and the total momentum must be zero.

So the total
