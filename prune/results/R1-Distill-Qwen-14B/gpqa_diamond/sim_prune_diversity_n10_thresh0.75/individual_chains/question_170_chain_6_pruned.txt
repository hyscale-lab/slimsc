Okay, so I'm trying to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4). Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the operator. Let me think about the steps.

First, the spin state is given as a vector (3i, 4). I think that's a column vector, right? So the state is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Oh wait, the question doesn't mention normalization, but I might need to check that. The normalization factor is the square of the magnitude, so |3i|^2 + |4|^2 equals (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 25, which is a real number. So the normalized state would be [3i/5 ; 4/5], because 5 squared is 25. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the state is normalized. Hmm. Oh, but expectation values use the state as given, regardless of normalization. Or wait, no, expectation values are calculated with the state as is, but perhaps I should use the given vector without normalizing because the operator's eigenvalues are in units of ħ/2, and the expectation value might already be considering the state's magnitude.

Wait, the spin operators for electrons are S_x, S_y, S_z. Each has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σ_x,
