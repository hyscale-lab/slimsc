Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

But wait, I should think about how this applies here. The lifetimes given are probably the uncertainties in time, Δt. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be inversely proportional to the lifetime. That is, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

But wait, the problem is about distinguishing two energy levels. So the energy difference between them should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, we might not be able to tell them apart—they could overlap in their energy ranges.

Wait, let me think again. Each state has an uncertainty in energy. For them to be resolved, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the combined uncertainties, there's a chance the energies could overlap and we can't distinguish them.

So the formula I should use is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and the difference must be bigger than the sum to ensure they don't overlap.

But wait, the lifetimes are given. Let me get the uncertainties in energy for each state first. Using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Wait, actually, the exact formula can vary, but for this problem, I think it's more about the order of magnitude.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the answer options are in eV, I need to convert J to eV. I know that 1 eV is approximately 1.602 × 10^-19 J. So 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.24
