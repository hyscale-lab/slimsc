Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which reaction sequence will lead to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.

Hmm, let me break down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3, right? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, numbering. I think in benzene, substituents are numbered based on the order of priority. The priority order is: nitro (highest), then ethoxy (since ether is lower than nitro), and then tert-butyl. Or wait, no, the substituents' priority is based on functional groups. So nitro is higher than ether, which in turn is higher than alkyl groups like tert-butyl.

Wait, let me remember the priority: The substituents have the following order from highest to lowest priority: -NO2 (nitro) > -SO3H (sulfonic acid) > -N+ (ammonium) > -O- (such as ethers, phenols, etc.) > -COOH (carboxylic acid) > -CN (cyano) > -COOR (ester) > -COR (ketone) > -NHCOCH3 (amide) > -X (halogens) > -OH (phenol) > -SH (thiol) > -NH2 (amine) > -OCH3 (ether, like ethoxy) > -CH2CH3 (alkyl).

Wait, so nitro is higher than ether, which is higher than tert-butyl. So in the target molecule, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Wait the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering is: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. Or wait, no. Wait, the numbers in the name are in the order of substituents' priority. So the substituent with the highest priority gets the lowest number.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). Wait, but the priority order is nitro (highest), then ethoxy, then t-butyl. So when numbering, the nitro group should get the lowest possible number, followed by the next highest. So the numbering should be such that the nitro is position 1, then ethoxy position 2, and t-butyl position 3? Or is that not right?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Let me think again. The IUPAC nomenclature for disubstituted benzene rings says that the substituents are numbered in
