Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the mass of the products isn't the same as the original because some mass is converted into energy. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, M is the initial mass, and the two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99M. That means some mass is lost, which is converted into energy—probably the kinetic energy of the fragments.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in the MeV range, and the initial energy is in GeV, so I'm guessing the difference is small, which makes sense because for low speeds, classical mechanics is a good approximation. But for high speeds, relativistic effects matter more.

Let me break it down. First, I need to find the masses of the two fragments. Let's denote the lighter fragment as m, so the heavier is 2m. Their sum is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M. So, m = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M. Wait, no wait. Because the sum is 0.99M. So 3m=0.99M. So m=0.33M, and the heavier is 0.66M. Wait, no, wait. Because if the two fragments are in a 1:2 mass ratio, then the sum is 3 parts. So each part is 0.99M/3. So the lighter is 0.33M, the heavier is 0.66M.

But wait, the initial nucleus was M, which had rest energy 300 GeV. So the initial rest mass energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total rest mass is 0.99M, so the rest mass energy is 0.99M*c², which is 0.99 *300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum must be zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the rest frame, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other. So if the masses are m1 and m2, their velocities must be such that m1 v1 = m2 v2 (in opposite directions), but maybe I should think in terms of relativistic momentum.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. So I need to calculate T1 correctly using relativity, and then subtract the non-relativistic approximation to find the difference.

So first, I'll model the situation. The initial nucleus is at rest, so total energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) = (m1 + m2)c² + T1 + T2. But because the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the relativistic momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2, where m2 = 2m1. So m1 + m2 = 3m1 = 0.99M. Therefore, m1 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33M, and m2 = 0.66M.

So, m1 c² = 0.33 M c² and m2 c² =0.66 M c².

The initial total energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. The rest mass after fission is 0.99M, so the rest mass energy is 0.99 *300 = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments: T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

But wait, that's not correct. Because in fission, the initial rest mass is M, so Mc² is the initial rest energy. After fission, rest energy is (m1 + m2)c² = 0.99M c².
