Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain part of the Sun's core reactions stops. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, because that's the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the Earth. So any effect from the Sun's core would take that time to reach us. But in this case, the neutrinos are affected, so the change would be noticed almost immediately, I think.

Wait, neutrinos don't really travel at the same speed as light, but they are very close. So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos we detect now would come from the reactions that are still happening. But neutrinos are produced in different layers of the Sun, right?

I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, where protons fuse into deuterium, then helium-3, and so on. The pp-II and pp-III are less significant but still contribute. 

The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, I believe. Because in the pp-III process, the reaction involves more energetic particles, so the emitted neutrinos would have higher energies. So if the pp-III stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos would decrease.

But the question is about the ratio of two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy, band 2 higher.

Wait, in the Sun, the dominant neutrino source is from the pp-I branch, but some come from other branches. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor, right? So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos would drop. But how does this affect the two bands?

Let me think about the neutrino energy spectrum. The pp-I process produces a broad spectrum, with a peak around a few hundred keV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy end (like 800-900 keV) would have less neutrinos. But what about the 700-800 keV range?

Wait, the pp-III branch's
