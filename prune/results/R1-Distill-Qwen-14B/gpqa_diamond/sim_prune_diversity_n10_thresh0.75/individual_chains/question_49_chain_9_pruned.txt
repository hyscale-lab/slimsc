Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The key here is that the terminal pi bond moves into a sigma bond. Examples given are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the problem has three different reactions to complete, so I'll need to tackle each one step by step.

Let's start with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm, what's going on here. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. I'm trying to remember what kind of reactions involve amines and alcohols with H+ and heat. Oh, maybe it's a rearrangement or a condensation.

Wait, but considering the presence of a methoxy group and a hydroxyl group... Oh, perhaps it's a Claisen-type rearrangement, but Claisen usually involves allyl vinyl ethers. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Cope rearrangement, but Cope is [3,3] for 1,5-dienes. Hmm.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOH. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a case of a transannular cyclization or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the two starting materials are reacting in an acid-catalyzed condition. Let's think about possible reactions between an amine and an alcohol under such conditions. Maybe hemiacetal formation or something else. But the presence of heat suggests it's a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dienamine or something that can undergo a [3,3] shift. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine could form a cyclic structure. If it's an enamine, maybe it can undergo a sigmatropic
