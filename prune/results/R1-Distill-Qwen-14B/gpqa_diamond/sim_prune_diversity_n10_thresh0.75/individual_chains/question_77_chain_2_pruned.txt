Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives two reactions and asks for the major products. Let me break it down.

First reaction: Starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, that's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (like an ether), attached to a methyl group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C2, and a substituent at C3.

So the structure would be something like benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Or wait, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2? Wait, but but is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 2 and 3, so but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituent (the rest of the molecule) attached at carbon 1. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- group, but wait, that would be five carbons if I include the substituent? No, wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons, so 1,2,3,4. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but attached to the CH
