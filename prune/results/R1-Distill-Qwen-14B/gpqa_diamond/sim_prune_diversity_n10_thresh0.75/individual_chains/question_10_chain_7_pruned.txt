Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to find out which one has the highest density. Let me see. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A, B, C, D.

The question gives four different scenarios for exoplanets. Each option describes different mass and radius or density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. And the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate the exact volumes here because the question is about comparing densities.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So if Earth's mass and radius are given, then its density would be the same as Earth's. Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³, I think. But wait, option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5. So that's the same density as Earth but twice the mass. Hmm, how does that fit?

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density 5.5. Since density is mass/volume, if the mass is double but density is same, the volume must be double. So the radius would be larger than Earth. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So if volume is double, radius is cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density, right? Because density depends on the material. So if it's same density, let's see. If mass is 5 times Earth's, then volume must be 5 times as well. Because density is mass/volume, so if density same, mass/volume same, mass proportional to volume. So volume is 5 times. So radius would be cube root of 5. Cube root of 5 is about 1.71, so radius is about 1.71 times Earth's. So density is same as Earth, so same as option a and b.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So same density. So if mass is half, volume is half. So radius would be cube root of 0.5. That's about 0.793 times Earth's radius. So density is same as Earth.
