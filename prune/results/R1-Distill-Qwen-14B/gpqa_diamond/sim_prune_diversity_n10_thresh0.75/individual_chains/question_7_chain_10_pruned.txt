Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process given is γγ → e+ e-. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm. I remember that the CMB photons have a certain energy, and high-energy gamma-rays can interact with them. The process is a photon-photon interaction producing electron-positron pairs. This probably has to do with the photon's lifetime being limited because they can annihilate each other, so their mean lifetime is determined by this process.

Wait, the problem is about the gamma-ray's lifetime being limited. So the gamma-ray is the high-energy photon here. So when a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon, they annihilate into an electron-positron pair. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening.

I think this relates to the concept of photon-photon interactions and the cross-section involved. The mean free path would determine how far a gamma-ray can travel before interacting, and thus, the lifetime is the age of the universe divided by the rate or something. Or maybe the lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate.

Let me try to recall the formula for the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation. I think the cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is given by some formula involving the energy of the photons. Oh right, the cross-section is proportional to the square of the logarithm of the photon energy ratio or something like that.

Wait, I remember that for two photons with energies E1 and E2, the cross-section for their annihilation into electron-positron pairs depends on the product of their energies, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression. Maybe the cross-section is proportional to (E1 * E2) / m_e^2 or something like that, where m_e is the electron mass. Because each photon's energy contributes to the invariant quantity s, which is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by σ = (4πα² / (9
