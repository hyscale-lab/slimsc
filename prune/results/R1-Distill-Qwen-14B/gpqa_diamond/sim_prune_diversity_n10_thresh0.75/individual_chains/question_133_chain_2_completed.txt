Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions are HPO₄^3- right? But wait, no, orthophosphate is actually PO₄^3-? Or is it HPO4^3- that's considered orthophosphate? Sometimes I get confused. Let me think: phosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and finally PO4^3- (orthophosphate). Oh wait, no, maybe orthophosphate is PO4^3-, while HPO4^2- is hydrogen orthophosphate? Hmm, I think I need to clarify that.

Wait, the question is asking for orthophosphate ions, which should be PO4^3-. But wait, let me think about the salts given. KH₂PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, if both are present, what does that imply about the pH of the solution? Because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accept a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (to become PO4^3-) or as a base (to become H2PO4^-). So in such a solution, the phosphate species will depend on the pH. 

But in this case, with both a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), the solution might be a buffer. Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, in this case, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the buffer would be based on the second dissociation of H3PO4, which has a Ka2 of 6.2e-8.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I thought were PO4^3-. So under what conditions does PO4^3- form? That's when HPO4^2- donates another proton. The third dissociation has a very small Ka, 1.8e-12, so PO4^3- is very minimal unless the solution is very basic.

But in this solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH should be around the pKa2 of H3PO4. Because when you have a buffer, the pH is usually around the pKa of the buffer system. So pKa2 here is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since 1e-7 is pH 7, 6.2e-8 is about 7.21). So the solution is probably slightly basic because the amount of HPO4^2- is 1.00g and H2PO4^- is 1.00g. Wait, but both are 1 gram, so the concentrations might be similar. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the buffer solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base (HPO4^2-) to the acid (H2PO4^-). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Since the amounts are the same, the log term is zero, so pH = pKa2 ≈7.21. 

At pH around 7.21, which is just slightly above neutral, what species are present? H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, since that's the buffer system. So in this solution, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible because the solution isn't strongly basic enough. But wait, the third dissociation is PO4^3- from HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So how much of that is present?

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Maybe orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? No, I thought orthophosphate was PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the phosphate species in solution. Let me write down the possible species:

- H3PO4 (triprotic)
- H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate)
- HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, or sometimes called orthophosphate, but I'm not sure)
- PO4^3- (orthophosphate ion, phosphate ion)

Wait, sometimes I've heard HPO4^2- referred to as orthophosphate. Maybe the question is using orthophosphate as HPO4^2-? Or maybe the problem is using a different definition. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the question specifically says orthophosphate ions. Let me think about the structure. The word "ortho" refers to the first dissociation step beyond the fully protonated form. So H3PO4 is the fully protonated, then H2PO4^- is the first deprotonated (ortho?), but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of the question, orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the options given are in the 1e-7 M range, which makes me think that the concentration is based on the second or third dissociation.

Let me think of the dissociation steps:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 =7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 =6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 =1.8e-12)

So in solution, if the pH is around 7.21, which is the pKa2, most of the H2PO4^- will be converted to HPO4^2- and vice versa. 

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- would be similar. But what about PO4^3-? Since Ka3 is very small, PO4^3- concentration would be very low unless the solution is very basic.

But given the pH is about 7.21, which is just slightly basic, the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with PO4^3- and H2O:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-

The concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation constant. So, let's compute it.

First, let's find the concentrations of the initial salts.

Molarity of KH2PO4:

Molar mass =136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol. Volume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.007336 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03668 M.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g /177.99 ≈0.005617 mol. Concentration is 0.005617 /0.2 ≈0.028085 M.

Wait, but when these salts dissolve in solution, they dissociate:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-
Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.028085 M

Wait, but wait, wait—hold on a second. Because the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So for KH2PO4, 1g is 1/136.09 ≈0.007336 mol. So 0.007336 mol in 0.2 L is 0.03668 M of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g is 1/177.99≈0.005617 mol. So 0.005617 mol in 0.2 L is 0.028085 M of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem says both are 1.00g. So the H2PO4^- concentration is higher than HPO4^2-.

But when these ions are in solution, they can undergo further dissociation. 

Moreover, the solution will establish a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is 6.2e-8. Let me calculate pKa2: log(6.2e-8) is approximately 7.208. So pH ≈7.21.

In this buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will adjust based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since they have different initial concentrations, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] will influence the pH.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We can rearrange this to find the ratio [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH - pKa2) 

We know pH is around 7.21 (since the initial pH is the pKa2 when concentrations are equal), but wait, in this case, the concentrations aren't equal. We have more H2PO4^- than HPO4^2- initially.

Wait, but wait. The initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.03668 M and [HPO4^2-] =0.028085 M. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.028085) / (0.03668) ≈ 0.766.

So the pH would be pKa2 + log(0.766) ≈7.208 + (-0.114) ≈7.094.

But wait, the actual pH of the solution would depend on this initial ratio. So now, we can model the system to find the exact concentrations of each species.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that in the solution, the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, but since the solution is slightly acidic or basic, the ratio will determine the exact concentrations.

Wait, maybe I should set up the charge balance.

In solution, the cations are K+ and Na+. Let's compute their concentrations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Moles of K+ = 0.007336 mol. So [K+] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005617 ≈0.011234 mol. So [Na+] = 0.011234 /0.2 ≈0.05617 M.

So total [cations] = [K+] + 2*[Na+] = 0.03668 + 2*(0.05617/2) = 0.03668 + 0.05617 = 0.09285 M.

Wait, but the anions must balance the cations. The anions are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Total negative charge from anions: [H2PO4^-] *1 + [HPO4^2-] *2.

Total positive charge: [K+] + [Na+].

So, [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-] = [K+] + [Na+].

Which is: [H2PO4^-] + 2 [HPO4^2-] = 0.03668 + 0.05617 = 0.09285 M.

But we also have the buffer equation.

Let me denote:

Let x = [H2PO4^-], y= [HPO4^2-], and z = [PO4^3-].

But wait, considering only the species present, and their contributions to the charge.

But it's getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the buffer equation again.

The buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log(y/x).

Additionally, the charge balance equation is x + 2y = [K+] + [Na+] = 0.09285.

Wait, but the problem is that when the solution is at pH 7.094, which is near the pKa2, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will adjust so that their ratio is 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.094 -7.208) = 10^(-0.114) ≈0.773.

Wait, which is about 0.773, so y/x ≈0.773. So y ≈0.773 x.

Then, from charge balance, x + 2*(0.773 x) =0.09285 → x (1 + 1.546) = 0.09285 → x = 0.09285 / 2.546 ≈ 0.03646 M.

Then y = 0.773 * 0.03646 ≈0.02814 M.

But wait, the initial concentrations from the salts were x=0.03668 M (H2PO4^-) and y=0.028085 M (HPO4^2-). So with the buffer, they change a little. But perhaps the changes are negligible, given that the initial x and y are close to the ratio based on pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the buffer equation and charge balance can help in determining the exact concentrations.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

So, from the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.028 M (from the initial calculation, but adjusted a bit to 0.02814 M). But in reality, we'd need to compute it more accurately.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be:

K_a3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We know [H+] from the pH. Since pH is approximately 7.094, [H+] = 10^(-7.094) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Substituting the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]≈0.028 M, [H+]≈8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028 ) / (8.23e-8 )

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028 = 5.04e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.04e-14 /8.23e-8 ≈6.12e-7 M.

Wait, but that's about 6.12e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7) or option D (3.97e-7) or another.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[H+] =10^(-pH) =10^(-7.094) ≈8.23e-8.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But [HPO4^2-] is 0.02814 M, as calculated earlier.

So 1.8e-12 * 0.02814 = 5.065e-14.

Divide that by 8.23e-8: 5.065e-14 /8.23e-8 = (5.065 /8.23 )e-6 ≈0.615e-6 =6.15e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.15e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) but a bit lower.

Wait, let me think again about the [HPO4^2-] concentration. Earlier, I approximated it as 0.02814 M, but perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations more precisely.

Let me define:

Let [H2PO4^-] = x

[HPO4^2-] = y

[PO4^3-] = z

We have the following equations:

1) From charge balance:

x + 2y + 3z = [K+] + [Na+]

But wait, K+ comes from KH2PO4, which is 0.007336 mol in 0.2 L, so [K+] = 0.03668 M.

Na+ comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 2 * 0.005617 /0.2 =0.05617 M.

So total [cations] =0.03668 +0.05617=0.09285 M.

Charge balance is x + 2y +3z =0.09285.

Wait, but in reality, the phosphate species (H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-) and any other ions (like OH^- or H+) need to balance the charge. But in the solution, the main cations are K+ and Na+, and the main anions are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, plus any H+ and OH^-.

Wait, but considering that the solution is aqueous, and the autoionization of water, perhaps it's better to include H+ and OH^- in the charge balance.

So, the charge balance equation is:

x (H2PO4^-) *1 + y (HPO4^2-) *2 + z (PO4^3-) *3 + [OH^-] = [K+] + [Na+] + [H+]

But [OH^-] = Kw / [H+] =1e-14 / [H+].

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make some approximations.

Given that the pH is around 7.09, [H+] is ~8e-8, and [OH^-] is ~1.2e-7.

So, the equation becomes:

x + 2y +3z +1.2e-7 ≈0.09285 +8e-8.

But 1.2e-7 is negligible compared to 0.09285, so:

x + 2y +3z ≈0.09285.

But that's still a complex equation. Maybe we can make assumptions, like z is very small, so 3z is negligible. Let me see: if z is 6e-7, 3z is 2e-6, which is much smaller than 0.09285 (~0.09 M). So perhaps 3z can be neglected.

So, x + 2y ≈0.09285.

Additionally, from the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log(y/x)

Since pH is approximately 7.094, and pKa2 is 7.208, the difference is -0.114. So log(y/x) =-0.114 → y/x =10^(-0.114)= ~0.773.

So, y =0.773 x.

Substituting into x + 2y ≈0.09285:

x + 2*(0.773 x )= x (1 +1.546 )=2.546 x =0.09285 →x=0.09285/2.546 ≈0.03646 M.

Then y=0.773 *0.03646 ≈0.0281 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.0281 M.

Now, considering the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3=1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-]=0.0281 M, [H+]=8.23e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281 ) / 8.23e-8

Calculating numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.0281=5.058e-14.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 5.058e-14 /8.23e-8 ≈6.146e-7 M.

So approximately 6.146e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7) but a bit lower.

But let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me recalculate the [H+] more accurately.

pH =7.094 → [H+] =10^-7.094.

10^0.094 ≈1.237 → so 10^-7.094 =10^(-7) *10^(-0.094) =1e-7 * (1/1.237)= ~8.08e-8.

So, [H+]≈8.08e-8.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) /8.08e-8.

1.8e-12 *0.0281 =5.058e-14.

5.058e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.058 /8.08 )e-6 →5.058/8.08 ≈0.626 →0.626e-6=6.26e-7.

Ah, so 6.26e-7 M, which is very close to option A (6.24e-7). So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7. So yes, that's the expected value.

But wait, wait. Did I correctly account for all the possible sources of error? Like, are the initial concentrations correct? Let me double-check the calculations for the moles.

For KH₂PO₄:

Molar mass = (39.10 for K) + 2*(1.008 H) + (30.97 P) +4*(16.00 O) →39.10 +2.016 +30.97 +64 → 136.086 g/mol. So 1.00g is 1/136.086≈0.007336 mol. Correct.

For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:

Molar mass =2*(22.99 Na) + (30.97 P) +4*(16.00 O) +2*(18.015 H2O) →45.98 +30.97 +64 +36.03 →177.01 g/mol. Close to 177.99 given, so 1.00g is 1/177.99≈0.005617 mol.

So the initial concentrations are correct.

Another consideration: when the salts dissolve, are there any other reactions? For example, the solubility of the salts. But both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are highly soluble in water, so their dissolution is complete, and their concentrations are as calculated.

So the next step is, with the [HPO4^2-] being ~0.0281 M and [H+]~8.08e-8, the [PO4^3-] is (1.8e-12 *0.0281)/(8.08e-8) ≈6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A)6.24e-7 → which is very close.

So the correct answer should be A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and the equilibrium conditions. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in a volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation steps for phosphate species are:

1. H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³)
2. H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸)
3. HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²)

### Step 1: Initial concentrations of phosphate species
- KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻:
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol}, \quad [H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻:
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol}, \quad [HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Buffer system and pH
The solution forms a buffer between H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the equilibrium governed by:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right).
\]
The pKa₂ is calculated as:
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
\]
The initial ratio of \([HPO₄²⁻]/[H₂PO₄⁻]\) is:
\[
\frac{0.028085}{0.03668} \approx 0.766.
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.
\]

### Step 3: Concentration of PO₄³⁻
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ arises from the third dissociation:
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \rightleftharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}.
\]
The equilibrium constant is:
\[
K_a₃ = \frac{[H⁺][PO₄³⁻]}{[HPO₄²⁻]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([PO₄³⁻]\):
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{K_a₃ [HPO₄²⁻]}{[H⁺]}.
\]
From the pH, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting values:
\[
[PO₄³⁻] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.0281)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.058 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \(6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds closely to option **A** (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

ANSWER: A
