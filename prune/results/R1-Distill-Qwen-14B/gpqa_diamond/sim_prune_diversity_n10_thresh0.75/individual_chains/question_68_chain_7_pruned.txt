Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. 

So, the setup is a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the fields are switched.

Wait, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So, when a spin-1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment mu aligns with the field. The energy levels are quantized based on the spin state. The magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. Oh wait, in this problem, mu is given as gamma * Sz, so it's aligned with the z-direction to begin with.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B, which, since B is along Z, becomes H_initial = -gamma B Sz. The energy levels for a spin-1/2 are E = ±(gamma B / 2), right? Because Sz has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, wait. Wait, actually, mu is gamma Sz, so the energy is H = - mu · B. Let me think. So H = - mu B, because B is along Z. So H = - gamma Sz B.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Sz are ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = - gamma B ħ/2 * (±1), which simplifies to E = ± gamma B ħ/2. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, mu is gamma * Sz. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So the energy is H = - mu · B. Since B is along +Z, it's H = - mu B. So H = - gamma B S_z.

So the eigenvalues of H are - gamma B times the eigenvalues of S_z. S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energies are E = - gamma B (± ħ/2) = ∓ gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, but sometimes people
