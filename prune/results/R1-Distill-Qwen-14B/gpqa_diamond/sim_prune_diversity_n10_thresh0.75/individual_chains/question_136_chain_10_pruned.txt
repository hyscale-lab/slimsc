Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. So, f(r) points radially outward or inward, I guess, depending on the direction. Since the magnitude is 1/r², as r increases, the field strength decreases.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. So, the divergence of f will tell us about the sources or sinks in the field.

First, since the field is only radial and its magnitude is 1/r², I should probably write it in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, a vector field that's purely radial can be written as f(r) = f_r e_r, where e_r is the unit radial vector. So f_r is 1/r², and the other components (like theta and phi directions) are zero.

Now, to find the divergence of f, I think the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. Let me recall. The divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r) / dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ dφ)) dA_φ/dφ]. But since our field only has A_r component and that's it, the other terms will be zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr.

So plugging in A_r = 1/r², we get:

div f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) 

Wait, let's compute that. r² multiplied by 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That would make the divergence zero. But wait, that can't be right because I've heard of the divergence theorem and Gauss's law, which relate the integral of divergence to the flux through the surface.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, the function is
