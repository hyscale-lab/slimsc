Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, sigmatropic rearrangements are a type of pericyclic reaction, right? I remember that in these reactions, a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond. So the pi bond migrates into a sigma bond. Common examples include the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem gives three different reactions and asks me to determine the products A, B, and C. Then, I have to match them with the options provided. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

I need to figure out what happens when these two compounds react under these conditions. Let's think about what each molecule looks like. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that can't be right because but is four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Let me correct that. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. But-3-en-2-ol: the structure is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, butenol.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, because but-3-en-2-ol would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons. The double bond in but-3-en-2-ol would
