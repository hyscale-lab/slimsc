Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that compounds A and B are each treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment leads to the formation of two different diketones. I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Wait, what's the reaction here? Oh right, I remember that when you treat amines or alcohols with certain reagents, you can get different products. But wait, the reagents mentioned are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh, right! That's the nitrous acid treatment, typically used for diazotization. Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic amines, but wait, this doesn't necessarily have to be aromatic. Wait, but in this case, the products are diketones. Diketones are compounds with two ketone groups. So how does that happen?

Oh, wait! I think this relates to the Gattermannâ€“Koch reaction or maybe something else. Or wait, another possibility: Maybe the starting materials are secondary alcohols. Because if you have a secondary alcohol and treat it with a nitrosation reagent, like HCl and NaNO2, you can form a nitroso compound. Wait, but what's the next step?

Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process. For instance, the treatment of a vicinal diol (1,2-diol) with nitrous acid and HCl
