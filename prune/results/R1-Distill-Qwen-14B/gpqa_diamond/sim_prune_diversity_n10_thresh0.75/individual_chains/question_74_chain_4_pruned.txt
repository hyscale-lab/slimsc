Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me try to recall what I know about decay probabilities.

Alright, the question says that an atom has a 32% probability of decaying within 100 minutes. So that's the given data. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Because 50 minutes have passed, and now we need the probability over the next 150 minutes. So that's a total of 200 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes starting now?

No, wait. The way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the next 150 minutes after the current time.

Hmm. So the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay. So the remaining time is 150 minutes. But wait, the decay is a Poisson process, right? It doesn't depend on the time that has already passed; the probability is based on the remaining time.

Wait, but in radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of the time since it was created. So, even if 50 minutes have passed, the probability for the next 150 minutes would just be based on the total time from now, regardless of the past. Because each moment is independent.

But wait, the given decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So I think that 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. But wait, no, wait. Because the way it's phrased is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the cumulative probability after 100 minutes.

So the decay follows an exponential decay model. So the decay probability is given by the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, and t is time.

We can find λ from the given data. So, at t=100 minutes, P=0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let's solve for λ.

So, 1 - 0.32 = e^(-100λ) → 0.68 = e^(-100λ). Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68), since ln(1) is 0, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So ln(0.68) would be approximately -0.3856 (since I remember that ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so
