Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about paramagnetic coupling and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz, which I think is the z-axis. It's given as 1 Tesla, which isn't too small. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so m is probably like 0 or ±1. 

The main task is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series, right? Because the Balmer-alpha line is around 0.486 micrometers, corresponding to the transition from n=2 to n=3 or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Balmer-alpha is the transition from n=3 to n=2. Because Balmer series starts at n=2; the first line would be n=3 to n=2, which emits in the visible range, like 656 nm. Wait, wait, but the given wavelength is about 0.486 micrometers, which is 486 nm. Oh, right, that's the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Or wait, no. Let me think: The Balmer series transitions are from n >=3 to n=2. The wavelength formula is λ = 1.097e4 m^{-1} * (1/2^2 - 1/n^2)^{-1}.

Wait, let me calculate the energy ΔE for the transition. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for a transition, ΔE = E_final - E_initial. Let's take the Balmer-alpha line, which is n=3 to n=2. So E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV, E_3 is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.511 eV. So ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy is positive when emitted, the magnitude is about 1.889 eV.

Wait, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. Let me compute the corresponding energy. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So λ is 486.1e-9 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9) = approximately 4.088e-17 J
