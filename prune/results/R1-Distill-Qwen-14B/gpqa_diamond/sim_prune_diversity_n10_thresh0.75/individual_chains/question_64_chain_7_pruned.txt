Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, is heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through three tubes in succession. Tube number 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, tube 2 with Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 with red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 gains 3.60 grams.
- Tube 3 gains 0.80 grams (and CuO is formed there).
- Tube 2's weight doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, let's think about the gases that form when salts A and B are heated. Since the setup is without air, it's likely a decomposition reaction. The gases are probably some combination of common products from such reactions. Since the gases are passed through certain reagents, I can probably use the reactions with these reagents to figure out what the gases are.

Let's look at each tube:

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, especially for acidic gases. It reacts with water vapor, but maybe also with other things. Wait, when anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is used, it's known to absorb water. So if the gas passing through it causes tube 1 to gain 3.60 grams, that mass increase is probably due to the absorption of water. So maybe the gas contains H2O vapor. But wait, the Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so it would react with any water in the gas. So perhaps the gas contains water, and the increase in mass is from water being absorbed.

But wait, in some cases, Mg(ClO4)2 can also react with other gases. For example, it can react with NH3, but I think it's more about absorbing water. So if tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, that's likely the mass of the water absorbed. So the initial gas mixture might have included water vapor.

But wait, the next tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. When a gas passes through a Ca(OH)2 solution, if the gas is CO2, it would react: CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Which suggests that the gas didn't contain CO2. Because if it did, the solution would have reacted, increasing the mass. But here, the mass didn't change. So CO2 isn't present.

Wait, but tube 1 is before tube 2. So perhaps the gas coming into tube 1 is a mixture, some
