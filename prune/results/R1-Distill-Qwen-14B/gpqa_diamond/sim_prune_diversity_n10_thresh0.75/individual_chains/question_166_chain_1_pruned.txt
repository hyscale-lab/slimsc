Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The Lagrangian given has several terms. Let me parse each one. The first term is i\bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R. Oh right, that's a kinetic term for some right-handed neutrinos, I think. Then there's a term (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2, which is the kinetic term for the scalar φ. The next term is |D^μ S|^2, which is the covariant derivative squared for the scalar doublet S. So S must be a Higgs-like field since it's a doublet.

Then there are some interaction terms: -(y_i/2)φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. Wait, \bar{N}^c is the charge conjugate, so this must be a Yukawa coupling term. It couples the scalar φ to the right-handed neutrinos. The next term is -g_{iα} \bar{N}_{iR} L_α S. L_α here would be the left-handed leptons, right? Since S is a doublet, this term probably induces some interactions between the neutrinos and the charged leptons via the scalar S.

And then there's a potential V(φ, S, H). Wait, but the question mentions that <φ>² is (x² + v²), and <φ> is x, while <h> is v. So φ is getting a VEV, and phi's VEV is a combination of x and v. Hmm, maybe h is another field, like the Higgs? Or perhaps φ and h are related fields here.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons usually come from spontaneous symmetry breaking when a symmetry is broken but not completely; the Goldstone theorem applies. So in the Standard Model, the Higgs has four degrees of freedom—two real fields, one becomes the Higgs boson (H), and the others become the W and Z bosons. Wait, but in the extended model here, perhaps there are more Higgs fields, leading to more Goldstone bosons.

The problem is about radiative corrections. So I'm thinking of using the one-loop correction to the mass, which often comes from the Coleman-Weinberg potential
