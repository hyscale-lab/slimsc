Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition, which is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Oh, and the options are given, so I can check my answer at the end.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. The formula I remember is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation is linear, I can separate this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Wait, but actually, since expectation is linear, it's the same as 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier because I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is given by |a|^2 * (1) + |b|^2 * (-1), because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The eigenstates are |↑⟩ for σz, which has eigenvalue +1, and |↓⟩ with eigenvalue -1. So the expectation value is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ in |ψ⟩.

In this case, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 which is 3/4, 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation of 10σz is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the other part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, this is a bit trickier because σx is the Pauli x-matrix, whose eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The expectation value for σx in a given state can be found using the formula involving the coefficients.

I remember that for a spin-1/2 particle in state α|↑
