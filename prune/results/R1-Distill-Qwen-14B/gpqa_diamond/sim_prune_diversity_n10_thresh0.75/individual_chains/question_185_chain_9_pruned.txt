Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. So the question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Wait, Pauli matrices. I think each Pauli matrix (σx, σy, σz) is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Oh, right, each σ_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, in the Hamiltonian here, it's a dot product of σ and n, so it's a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of n.

Hmm, so the dot product σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So the operator H is ε times this combination.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H. Since σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a combination of Pauli matrices, I think its eigenvalues are ± something. Because Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1, their combinations might have similar properties.

Wait, the trace of σ ·n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector. So the trace of H would be ε times the trace of σ ·n, which is zero. Hence, the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of H would be (ε)^2 times the determinant of σ ·n. The determinant of σ ·n is the product of its eigenvalues. Since each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, the combination should also have eigenvalues ±1 because the operator is a unit vector direction multiplied by the Pauli vector. So the determinant would be (±1)(∓1) = -1. So determinant of σ ·n is -1.

Thus, for H, determinant is (ε^2)(-1) = -ε². The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 = -ε², so λ = ±iε? Wait wait, that doesn't make sense because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian since it's an observable.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, the determinant of σ ·n is actually the square of the product of its eigenvalues. Because for a 2x2 matrix, det(M) = product of eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are ±a, then determinant is (a)(-a) = -a². For σ ·n, the eigenvalues would be +1 and -1 because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1, so their combination when normalized would have the same eigenvalues.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because σ ·n is a 2x2 matrix, and when you diagonalize it, it'll
