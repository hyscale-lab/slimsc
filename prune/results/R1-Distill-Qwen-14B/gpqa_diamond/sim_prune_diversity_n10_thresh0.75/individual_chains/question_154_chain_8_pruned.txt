Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you get a problem like this, you have to analyze the given data step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist found a white solid, and he has some spectral information. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one it is. Let me jot down the data.

The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has signals at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).

Let me start by looking at the IR spectrum. Broad peaks in the 3500-2700 cm^-1 region usually indicate O-H groups, maybe from alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyls in carboxylic acids are usually around 1700 cm^-1, but if it's an ester or an acid chloride, they might be higher. Wait, wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because they're strong acids, so if the broad peak is there, could it be a carboxylic acid?

Looking at the options: option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Both have a COOH group. The other options are a benzaldehyde and a chloroformate.

Wait, but what about the NMR? The NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton (like around 9-10 ppm) or a carboxylic acid proton (which is usually broad or sharp around 10-12 ppm). But the singlet suggests maybe a single proton. Carboxylic acids have a -COOH group, which is a -OH. But in NMR, the proton for the -OH in a carboxylic acid is usually broad because of hydrogen bonding, but in this case, the peak is a singlet, not broad. Wait, but maybe it's an aldehyde? Because aldehyde protons are sharp singlets around 9-10 ppm. But here it's 11.0, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a phenol? No, because phenols have -OH protons around 5-7 ppm, and they're usually broad. But wait, the IR has a
