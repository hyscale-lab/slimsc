Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts, which allows us to solve the Schrödinger equation more easily. Let me think about this potential.

So, V(r,θ) is composed of two terms: the first is (1/2)k r², which is a function of r only, and the second is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which depends on both r and θ. Hmm, but perhaps I can rewrite this in a way that it separates into functions of r and θ.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Oh, right! Because in polar coordinates, r² cos²θ is just x², since x = r cosθ. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Wait, that would be better because x is a Cartesian coordinate. So the potential can be written as V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me simplify that.

Combining the terms, (1/2)k x² + (3/2)k x² is (2k x²)/2 * (1/2 + 3/2) wait no, wait: 1/2 plus 3/2 is 2, so the x² term is 2k x². And then the y² term is (1/2)k y². So the potential becomes V(x,y) = (2k) x² + (1/2 k) y². Hmm, so it's a sum of two harmonic oscillator potentials, but with different coefficients.

Wait, each direction (x and y) has a harmonic oscillator potential. In quantum mechanics, each direction is treated independently, and the energy levels are quantized. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.

But wait
