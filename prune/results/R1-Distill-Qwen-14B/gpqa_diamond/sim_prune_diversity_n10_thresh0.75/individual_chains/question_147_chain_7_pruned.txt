Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of charge + and -, which I guess are some kind of mesons or something. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but wait, the question is about the velocity of particle A. Hmm.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh right, that must mean that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate it using non-relativistic methods? But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the situation is simpler.

Let me think about the conservation laws. Since it's an annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved. But given that the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass momentum? Or wait, the antiproton is moving, but slowly, so perhaps in the initial frame, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with some low speed. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem statement says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. 

Wait, but in reality, protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass. So the proton is at rest, and the antipro
