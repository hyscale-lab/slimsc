Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed in a way that maintains some fundamental symmetries. But which ones exactly?

The question gives four options: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these, and I need to pick which combination is correct.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like momentum conservation). So if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. But in some cases, maybe the SMEFT itself doesn't necessarily require Poincare? Or does it?

I think SMEFT is built from a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Well, Poincare symmetry is more about the whole spacetime including translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which by default includes Poincare symmetry, I suppose all operators must respect that too. So both Lorentz and Poincare are in.

Then there's CP and CPT. I remember that the Standard Model has CPT symmetry. CPT is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). But does SMEFT require operators to respect CP symmetry? I'm not so sure.

Wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric, but not necessarily CP. For example, certain processes in the Standard Model violate CP, like in the electroweak interactions. So the SMEFT operators need to respect CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So looking back at the options, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So operators must respect Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2). Also, CPT (4) is a must because the Standard Model does that, and SMEFT is a generalization. But CP (3) isn't necessarily required because the Standard Model doesn't require it either.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect certain symmetries. Lorentz symmetry (1) is fundamental to relativistic field theories, including SMEFT, as it ensures the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations. Poincaré symmetry (2), which includes Lorentz symmetry along with translations, is also respected because SMEFT is a field theory, which inherently incorporates Poincaré symmetry.

CP symmetry (3), however, is not necessarily required by SMEFT. The Standard Model, from which SMEFT generalizes, already includes CP-violating processes, such as in the electroweak sector. Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to enforce CP symmetry.

CPT symmetry (4), on the other hand, is a fundamental symmetry in the Standard Model and is also respected by SMEFT. This symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T), and it is preserved in the SMEFT framework.

Thus, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Among the given options, the correct combination is **C) 1,2,4**.

Answer: C
