Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a certain angle and the form of the function f. 

The setup says the charge distribution is spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. I think this symmetry affects how the radiation is distributed in different directions. 

The problem mentions that the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle with the z-axis. They're asking for the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also the form of f.

Wait, I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh right, an oscillating dipole radiates in a particular pattern. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole's axis, which is the z-axis here. So the maximum radiation is at theta=90 degrees, and the intensity drops off as you go towards the poles (theta=0 or 180).

The formula for the power per unit solid angle, I think, is given by the dipole radiation formula. The formula is something like P = (d^2 P sin^2(theta) ) / (something with lambda and constants), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact expression.

Wait, let me think. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin^2 theta)/(lambda^4) perhaps. Or wait, no, maybe the dependence is different. Let me get this straight: The total power is proportional to (d^2/dt^2)^2, but when considering per unit solid angle, the angular part comes in.

Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is (sin^2 theta) in some form. So the function f(lambda, theta
