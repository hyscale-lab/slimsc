Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. Hmm, I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. Let me start breaking this down.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with certain structures—eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

Then, they made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector probably has two coding regions: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I'm not too familiar with CBA, but I think it's a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. Oh wait, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of the downstream gene without a promoter—so in this case, the receptor would be expressed from the CBA promoter, and the IRES would allow the eGFP to be expressed as well? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe the IRES is after the receptor, so the receptor is expressed from the promoter and the IRES is for the eGFP? I'll have to think.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. And between receptor ORF and eGFP, a stop cassette with lox2272. Oh, right, these are different loxP sites. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can delete the regions between them. So, when Cre is expressed, it would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

So the vector would initially have the ligand with a stop, and the receptor with another stop. Then, in the presence of Cre, the stops are removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. But wait, how does this work with bicistronic vectors? Because the ligand is first, then the receptor. So, in the absence of Cre, maybe the ligand is not expressed because of the stop? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning it's designed to express two proteins. The loxP and lox2272 sites are in the vector such that when Cre is present, they can be recombined, allowing the stop cassettes to be excised, and the two ORFs to be expressed.

So the ligand is under the CBA promoter. The promoter would drive transcription of the entire construct, starting with the ligand ORF. But the ligand is fused to mCherry. But there's a stop in between the ligand and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, preventing translation beyond that. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop before eGFP.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so the ligand's coding sequence is before the mCherry. So the construct would be: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry. Then, after that, IRES, and then receptor ORF -> stop (lox227
