Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

So, the question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses a different starting material and reagent. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral one. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but in some cases, depending on the structure, other reductions can happen. So, the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one, with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon. Structure-wise, that would be CH2CH2 groups on either side, but let me visualize it.

Hexan-3-one is:
CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, noâ€”hexan-3-one would have the ketone group on carbon 3. So, numbering from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, it's CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but wait, 5-methoxy means the methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-? Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Or maybe I should draw it. So, the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be 3-pentanone if it's five carbons. Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons with the ketone on C3. So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but wait, carbon 3 is the ketone. So positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: CH3

Wait, no, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexane is six carbons.
