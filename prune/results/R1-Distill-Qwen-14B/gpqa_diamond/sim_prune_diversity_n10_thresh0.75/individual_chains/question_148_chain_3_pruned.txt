Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular weight of some compound A4. Let me read through the problem again and try to understand what's going on.

The question mentions five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. I remember that elements like O, C, or maybe something else form various fluorides, but the specifics are a bit hazy.

The problem describes several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. Let's break them down one by one.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F) is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, 31.96% might be the percentage by mass of fluorine in A2. Let me calculate that. So if the mass of F is 31.96%, maybe the formula can be determined. Let's see, fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 (F is ~19 g/mol), so if we have 31.96% F, that's roughly 31.96/19 ≈ 1.68 moles of F per 100g. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of molecular formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxidation state of F in A2 is +1. Wait, because I remember that in many compounds, the oxidation states are like that. For example, in NaF, F is -1. Oh wait, but if A2 has oF of 31.96% (maybe that's the percent composition), then perhaps the formula can be found.

Wait, maybe it's the oxidation state. Oh wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%", which I'm a bit confused about. Is that the oxidation state or the mass percentage? Hmm, I think that's the oxidation state. Because the notation might be different. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage by mass, like the composition. Let me think, if A2 is a product of A1 decomposition and fluorine, perhaps A2 is a fluoride.

Wait, A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. So maybe A1 is a more complex fluoride that breaks down into a simpler one and releases F2.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is inert, so for a substance to oxidize it, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but which of these compounds would be? Perhaps something like F2 itself, but wait, A1 is a compound, not elemental F2. So maybe A1 is a fluorine-rich compound. But I'm not sure yet.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So when Y reacts with F2, it forms A3. So Y is some element that when fluorinated forms a fluoride. Then A3 is YF_x for some x.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A
