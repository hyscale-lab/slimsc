Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions, and I need to identify the substances involved. Let me list out what I understand.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking maybe solid A is something like sulfur, which reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to form something red. Wait, but gas B is a reactant. Sulfur reacts with H2SO4 in a reaction that produces S (maybe another form?), but I'm not sure yet. Or wait, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. No, maybe another approach.

Wait, another thought: The product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like SO3^2- maybe? Or perhaps a compound with a red color. Wait, another possibility: when metals like sodium or potassium react with sulfur, they form compounds. Alternatively, the reaction of a metal with a halogen. Or perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur trioxide or something similar.

Wait, considering that C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Let me think. If C is a salt, perhaps a sulfite or sulfate. Wait, when a sulfite (like Na2SO3) reacts with water, it doesn't really produce anything, but perhaps if it's something like a mixed salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate.

Wait, another angle: Let me think about the first reaction. Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → C (bright red). Then, C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous), and C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong acid, G is weak.

Wait, suppose A is Ag (silver), but not sure. Or maybe A is a metal like Na. Let me think about if B is a halogen, like Cl2. If A is Na, then 8 equivalents of Cl2... that doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe B is sulfuric acid? Because sometimes reactions with concentrated sulfuric acid can be exothermic and produce various products.

Wait, let me think again. If solid A is sodium sulfide (Na2S), but I'm not sure how that would react with gas B. Alternatively, when sodium reacts with something to form a bright red product. Wait, maybe the product C is sodium sulfide? Or perhaps it's Na2O2? No, that's usually pale yellow. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is sulfur reacting with something. Let's think about solid A as sulfur (S8). Gas B could be O2, but 8 equivalents might not make sense. Alternatively, another gas. Wait, if A is S8 and B is O2, but when S8 reacts with O2, it forms SO2 or SO3. But if 8 equivalents is a lot, perhaps it's a reaction that produces a sulfate.

Wait, another approach: The product C when reacted with D produces E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene, but I'm not certain.

Wait, considering the D part: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So what's a gas (B) reacting with D to form a solvent (H)? Common solvents include water, alcohols, maybe ethers, etc. If H is a solvent, maybe H is H2O? But then, D and B would react to form H2O. Alternatively, if H is ethanol, then D and B could be something like CO2 and something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe D is H2S and B is something like O2? But H2S plus O2 in a 1:1 ratio would form H2O and S, but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, D could be SO2, and B could be H2O, but then H would be H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), which is a liquid but not a common solvent. Not sure.

Alternatively, B could be Cl2 and D could be H2O. Wait, Cl2 and H2O react to form HClO and HCl, but that's in a 1:1 ratio. But HClO is a strong oxidizing agent but not a solvent.

Wait, another thought: If B is NH3 gas, and D is HCl gas, then they can react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O.

Wait, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), a common solvent. Then, D and B would react to form CH3OH. For example, CO2 reacting with H2 in a 1:1 ratio under certain conditions could form methanol, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, another combination.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is NH3. They react in 1:1 to form NH4OH (which is NH4+ and OH- in solution), but that's not a pure solvent, but more like a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another part: C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids and A.

What compounds hydrolyze to produce two different acids? Maybe a salt that can hydrolyze in two ways. For example, if C is a sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), but then hydrolysis would not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide, like Na2S. When Na2S reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base) and H2S (which is a weak acid). But the question says A is reformed, plus F and G. So maybe A is Na, F is H2SO4 (but that's a strong acid), and G is something else. Hmm, not quite matching.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate salt. For example, if C is ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), upon hydrolysis, it could produce nitric acid (HNO3, strong) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, which is weak acid, but more accurately, it's a weak base). Not sure if that fits.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate, like Na2SO4. But when it hydrolyzes, it doesn't produce much acid or base.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3 hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which is a weak acid when dissolved in water as H2CO3). Hmm, but in this case, the acids would be H2CO3 (weak) and maybe something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfonate ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide like FeS. Upon hydrolysis, FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Fe(OH)2 is a base (but not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, Ca(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. The NO3^- can hydrolyze in water to form HNO3 (strong acid) and other products. But I'm not sure if that's two acids.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, maybe C is a salt that can hydrolyze to produce two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like calcium carbide (CaC2), which reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide (a strong base) but that's not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to form O2 and NaOH. But that's only one base, not two acids.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider the second reaction: C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is something like chlorine gas, but that's not produced in this case. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. How is phosgene made? It's typically produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst. Hmm.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then perhaps the reaction of C with D (Cl2?) produces COCl2. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Wait, in the first reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C. Maybe A is carbon (solid), and B is O2. But 8 equivalents of O2? Not sure. Carbon reacting with O2 would form CO or CO2, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: Maybe A is sodium (Na), B is Cl2. Then, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with Na to form NaCl. But the product would be NaCl, which is white, not bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: What if A is sulfur (S8), and B is O2? Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would react with S8 to form SO3? But that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product C is AgBr? No, because it's a reaction with a gas. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Na, and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 would form NaO2, but I'm not sure if that's a thing.

Wait, maybe B is water vapor. Then, solid A (like Na) reacts with H2O to form NaOH and H2. But that's a possibility. But then, C would be NaOH. But NaOH isn't bright red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide. For example, FeS as solid A. Reacting with H2SO4 (B) would produce FeSO4 (C?), which is greenish, not red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product C is something like Fe(OH)3, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I don't know the reaction path.

Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic gas like sarin, but I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Wait, maybe E is a nerve agent, but I don't have enough info.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic compound like diphosgene or another organophosphate, but again, I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So if C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces two acids, one strong and one weak.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base, but not an acid). Doesn't fit.

Wait, another option: C is ammonium sulfide, (NH4)2S. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to produce NH3 (weak base) and H2S (weak acid). But in this case, F and G would be NH3 (base) and H2S (acid), but the problem says F is a strong acid and G a weak acid. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a nitride, like Na3N. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 and NaOH. Again, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. It hydrolyzes to produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (which in water is H2CO3, a weak acid). So in this case, F would be H2CO3 (weak acid) and G would be NaOH (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate salt that can hydrolyze. For example, if C is Fe2(SO4)3, then hydrolysis might produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and Fe(OH)3 (weak base). But that's one acid and one base, not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester. Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate salt. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Maybe F and G are both acids formed when C is hydrolyzed. For F to be strong, perhaps it's H2SO4, and G is HNO3? No, that wouldn't make sense unless C contains both sulfate and nitrate, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. For example, a double salt like NaNO3 and Na2SO4, but then hydrolysis would produce both HNO3 and H2SO4. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a diacid salt. For example, something like NaHPO4, which upon hydrolysis could produce H3PO4 (strong?) and H2PO4^- (weaker acid). Wait, H3PO4 is a weak acid, not strong. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid). So C would be something that upon hydrolysis produces HCl and H2S. But what compound would that be? Maybe a sulfide chloride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide of a metal, like CuS, which upon hydrolysis with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and Cu(OH)2 (base). But again, that's one acid and one base.

Wait, another thought: If C is a chloro-sulfite or something like that. Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about the second reaction again. C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic.

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, phosgene can be made by the reaction of carbon monoxide with chlorine in the presence of a catalyst. So if C is CO and D is Cl2, then E would be COCl2.

But then, how does C (CO) get produced from the first reaction? Let's see.

In the first reaction, C is formed from A and B. So perhaps A is carbon (solid), and B is O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with carbon to form CO. Wait, but 8 equivalents would imply a stoichiometric ratio, which for CO would be 1 O2 per 2 C (since 2C + O2 → 2CO). So 8 equivalents of O2 would require 8 * 1 = 8 moles of O2, but the reaction would produce 16 moles of CO. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but then C would be CO, which is a gas, but the question states that C is a product, possibly a solid or a bright red liquid or solid. Wait, perhaps the product is not CO. Maybe C is something else.

Wait, another possibility: In the first reaction, A is carbon (solid), and B is Cl2. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with carbon to form CCl2 or CCl4. But CCl4 is a colorless liquid, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is something else. Another thought: maybe the product C is silver bromide (AgBr), but that's a pale yellow solid, not red.

Wait, another idea: maybe the product C is a sulfide. For example, when Group 1 metals react with H2S, they form sulfides. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, perhaps it's a different approach. Let's think about the possible substances involved.

If C is a nitrosyl chloride (ClNO), which is a red gas. But nitrosyl chloride is a red-brown gas, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl2O7 (chloric acid), which is a yellowish gas, not red.

Wait, perhaps C is a different compound. Let me think about the reactions again.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a metal reacting with a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) reacts with Cl2 gas to form NaCl. But NaCl is a white solid, not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, if A is FeO (wustite), and B is Cl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction product.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the symmetry group of E, which is the main question. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Symmetry groups are determined by the molecule's geometry. For example, D4h is the symmetry group for a square planar molecule like XeF4. C2 is for a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like H2O (but H2O has C2v symmetry). Wait, no, H2O has a C2v point group.

Wait, D∞h is the symmetry group for a linear molecule with an infinite number of planes perpendicular to the axis, like CO2 or HCN.

C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry.

So, if E is a linear molecule with symmetry D∞h, its structure would be something like CO2 or O3. Alternatively, if E is a trigonal planar molecule, it might have C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like H2O, which has C2v symmetry, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene, which is O=C(Cl)2. The structure of phosgene is a planar molecule with two chlorine atoms and one oxygen attached to a central carbon. The point group for phosgene is D∞h because it's linear, with two mirror planes and a center of inversion.

Wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. The molecule is planar and linear, so it has a linear structure. The point group is D∞h because it has a principal axis of order 2 (C2), a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis (σh), and other symmetry elements.

So if E is phosgene, its symmetry group is D∞h. Then the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, let me check the reactions again. If C is CO and D is Cl2, then the reaction would produce phosgene. So C + D → E: CO + Cl2 → COCl2 (phosgene), which is a reaction that can occur under certain conditions.

But earlier, I thought that C is formed from A and B. So if A is carbon and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 would produce CO. Alternatively, perhaps A is something else.

Wait, another possibility: What if A is a metal, and B is a sulfur compound. For example, A is Fe, and B is H2S. Then, Fe reacts with H2S to form FeS (solid), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, B is sulfur vapor, and they react to form a sulfide. For example, Fe + S → FeS. But FeS is black, not bright red.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the identification of A, B, C, etc., but since the question is about the symmetry group of E, and I think E is phosgene with D∞h symmetry, the answer might be option B: D4h.

Wait, but wait! Phosgene has D∞h symmetry, which is option C: D∞h. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

So if E is phosgene, the symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). But earlier I thought the answer was D4h (option B), which is incorrect. So perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the structure of phosgene. It's O=C(Cl)2, which is a planar molecule with a linear structure. The point group is D∞h because of the infinite number of symmetry planes along the molecular axis.

Wait, but phosgene's structure has a central carbon with double bond to oxygen and single bonds to two Cl atoms. It's a trigonal planar molecule, but the point group is D∞h because it's linear in the sense that all atoms are in a plane, so the molecule has a center of inversion and a principal C2 axis with multiple mirror planes.

Wait, no, the point group for a molecule like phosgene is actually D∞h, which is option C. Because the molecule is linear (like CO2), it has D∞h symmetry. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, the options don't have D∞h as option C? Let me check:

Options:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

Yes, option C is D∞h. So I think the correct answer is C) D∞h.

But earlier I thought the answer was D4h, which is option B. Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the options.

Wait, another possibility: What if E is diphosgene (Cl2C=O)2O. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

Wait, if E is HCl, which is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h. But HCl isn't extremely hazardous unless in high concentration.

Another possibility: E is Cl2O, which is phosgene again. So yes, D∞h.

So, putting it all together, the molecular symmetry group of E is D∞h, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests that C could be a compound like phosgene (COCl₂), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is produced when carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl₂).

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. Based on the reactions, E is identified as phosgene (COCl₂), a highly toxic and volatile compound.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A, and two acids F and G are produced. This supports the identification of C as CO, which can hydrolyze to form carbonic acid (H₂CO, weak acid) and other products.

4. **Symmetry Group of E**: Phosgene (COCl₂) is a planar molecule with a linear structure. It has a principal C₂ axis, a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the molecular axis (σh), and an infinite number of vertical mirror planes. This corresponds to the molecular symmetry group **D∞h**.

Given the options:

- **A) C2**: This corresponds to a molecule with only a two-fold rotation axis, which does not match the symmetry of phosgene.
- **B) D4h**: This corresponds to a molecule with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes, which does not match the symmetry of phosgene.
- **C) D∞h**: This corresponds to a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and an infinite number of vertical mirror planes, which matches the symmetry of phosgene.
- **D) C2v**: This corresponds to a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes, which does not match the symmetry of phosgene.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E (phosgene) is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
