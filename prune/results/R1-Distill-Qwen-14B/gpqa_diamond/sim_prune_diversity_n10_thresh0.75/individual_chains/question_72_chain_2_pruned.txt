Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it goes through several stepsâ€”like reacting with something, treating with sulfuric acid, then SO3 and pyridine, and finally heating. The goal is to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, I need to understand each reaction step and what's happening structurally.

Step 1: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Product 1 is formed.

Wait, what's happening here? Sodium iodide is a nucleophile, maybe an SN2 reaction. The starting material has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group? Or maybe the dibromomethyl groups are involved in some substitution.

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that molecule has two dibromomethyl groups attached to the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those methyl groups has two bromines attached.

When you have dibromomethyl groups, reacting them with a base like NaI could lead to elimination or substitution. Since there are two equivalents, maybe each of the dibromomethyl groups undergoes substitution.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Alternatively, maybe the starting material with the bicyclo ring is undergoing some kind of Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene, and the other reactant has two dienophiles (bis(dibromomethyl) groups).

Wait, let me think about that. The starting material is a bicyclo diene, which is a conjugated diene. The other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,
