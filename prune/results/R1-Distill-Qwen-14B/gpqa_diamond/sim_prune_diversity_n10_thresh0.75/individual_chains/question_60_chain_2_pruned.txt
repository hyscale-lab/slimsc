Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, it's about space travel and time dilation. So, time dilation is that effect where time moves slower for someone moving at a high speed relative to another observer. I remember from my studies that this is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity.

The problem says there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's like 99.999987% the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. So, they live a long time, but the question is about their astronaut who's 22 years old.

The astronaut is going to Earth, and they're traveling at this high speed. The question is, how long will it take from the astronaut's perspective? So, we're looking for the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the time it takes for the spacecraft to reach Earth from their perspective, considering time dilation. 

But wait, wait, first, I should probably figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give the distance, so maybe that's not needed. Or perhaps it's implied that we're considering the time experienced by the astronaut during the trip, regardless of the distance. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no. Because if the spacecraft is moving at a high speed, the distance between Earth and their starting point will be length-contracted from the astronaut's frame of reference. So, the time taken would be the contracted distance divided by the speed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh wait, perhaps the distance is assumed to be such that from Earth's perspective, the time taken is significant enough to bring up the issue of time dilation. Or maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the time experienced by the astronaut is so short that they don't even age much, but the aliens have a longer lifespan. Or perhaps I'm missing some data.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance is about 160,000 to 200,0
