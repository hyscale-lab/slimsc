Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, each charge is twice the elementary charge. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to mass. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate it and see which one matches.

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy for a system of charges is given by the formula U = k * q1 * q2 / r, but for multiple charges, it's a bit more involved. Since all the charges are identical, I can probably compute the potential energy for each pair and sum them up.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge. But what about the distances between the 12 moving charges themselves? Are they all at a mutual distance of 2 meters from each other? Or is each of them at 2 meters from point P, but their separation from each other could be different?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. So each is at 2 meters from P. But their positions relative to each otherâ€”if they're all at 2 meters from P, they could form a sphere around P, but their mutual distances could vary. But since the problem says "constrained" to stay at 2 m, I think their positions are fixed in a way that they all lie on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. So, perhaps each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P, but the distance between any two of them isn't fixed. But wait, for the potential energy calculation, we have to consider all pairs, right?

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So, I might have to think about how to arrange the charges to minimize the potential energy. Because the potential energy depends on the distances between the charges.

Wait, but in the problem
