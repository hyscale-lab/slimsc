Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field changes direction. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. Since the field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by the spin in the Z direction. The possible states are spin-up and spin-down along Z, with energies proportional to S_z. So, when the field is on, the system is in an eigenstate of S_z, right?

But then the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So, the direction of the magnetic field changes from Z to Y. The particle's spin, which was aligned along Z before, will now precess around Y, I think. Because when the field changes direction, the spin will start to precess around the new field direction.

Wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is mu_z = gamma * S_z. So, we're being asked about the time dependence of <S_z>, and specifically, its oscillation frequency.

In the initial state, when the field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate. After the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. I remember that when the Hamiltonian changes, the system's state might no longer be an eigenstate, leading to time evolution and oscillations in expectation values.

The new Hamiltonian after the field is along Y should be H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, that would be H = -gamma B S · Y direction. Wait, more accurately, the magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B = -gamma B S_y, because the field is along Y. Or wait, wait, no: the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin, so the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. Since the field is along Y, then H is proportional to S_y.

Wait, let me think. The magnetic moment mu is given as mu = gamma S, so the energy is H = -mu · B. The B is along Y, so H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S_y is an operator, and the spin
