Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Non-Gaussianity is being measured using relative entropy, del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix, and rho is the given state's density matrix.

Wait, so non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, right? And the relative entropy measures how different rho is from a Gaussian state tau. So higher del_b means more non-Gaussian.

But wait, the problem is to calculate del_b. How do I approach this?

First, I think I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. So rho is |psi><psi|.

Let me write down the state first. Let's compute N for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4: 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5). So N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5). Wait, that's 1 - exp(-0.5). Let me compute that numerically.

Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but wait: N is the normalization constant. So |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

But wait, when phi is -pi/4, let's compute cos(phi) and sin(phi).

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state becomes [0.7071 |alpha> - 0.7071 |-alpha> ] / N.

Hmm, but what's the density matrix rho? It's |psi><psi|. So let me expand that.

rho = [|alpha> c1 + |-alpha> c2] [ <alpha| c1* + < -alpha| c2* ] / N^2.

So that's (c1^2 |alpha><alpha| + c2^2 | -alpha><-alpha| + c1 c2^* |alpha><-alpha| + c2 c1^* | -alpha><alpha| ) / N^2.

Where c1 is cos(phi) and c2 is sin(phi). Oh wait, but phi is negative, so c2 is negative.

Wait, but coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a, with eigenvalues alpha and -alpha respectively. They are also over the same basis, so their inner product is <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + | - alpha|^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha)* )? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product between |alpha> and |beta> is exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha^* beta ).

So <alpha | -alpha> would be exp( - (|alpha|² + |alpha|²)/2 + (-alpha) * alpha ) = exp( - alpha² + (-alpha^2) ), wait no:

Wait, let's compute it properly. The inner product <alpha| beta> is exp(- (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha^* beta ). So when beta is -alpha,

< alpha | -alpha > = exp( - (alpha² + alpha²)/2 + (alpha^*) (-alpha) )

= exp( - alpha² + (- |alpha|²) )

Wait, because alpha is real in this case? Because the question says alpha is the amplitude, so perhaps real. So alpha is 0.5, and real.

So for beta = -alpha, which is also real, the inner product is exp( - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + (alpha)(-alpha) )

= exp( - (alpha²) + ( - alpha² ) )

= exp( -2 alpha² )

Wait, because alpha is real, so alpha* is alpha. So the inner product becomes exp( - (2 alpha²)/2 + ( - alpha² ) ) = exp( -alpha² - alpha² ) = exp( - 2 alpha² ).

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck.

Wait, the general formula for <alpha | beta> is e^{- (|α|^2 + |β|^2)/2 + α* β}.

So if beta is -alpha, then α* β = α*(-alpha) = - alpha^2.

So, <alpha | -alpha> = e^(- (alpha² + alpha²)/2 + (- alpha²)).

Which is e^(- (2 alpha²)/2 - alpha²) )= e^(- alpha² - alpha² )= e^{-2 alpha²}.

Yes, that's correct.

So, going back to the density matrix rho. It's [ |alpha><alpha| * c1^2 + | -alpha><-alpha| * c2^2 + c1 c2^* e^{-2 alpha²} |alpha><-alpha| + c2 c1^* e^{-2 alpha²} | -alpha><alpha| ] / N^2.

So c1 is cos(phi)= sqrt(2)/2, c2 is sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2.

So c1^2 is (0.5), same for c2^2, since (-sqrt(2)/2)^2 is 0.5.

So rho = [0.5 |alpha><alpha| + 0.5 |-alpha><-alpha| + (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) e^{-2 alpha²} ( |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ] / N^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute c1 c2^* = (sqrt(2)/2) * ( - sqrt(2)/2 )^* = since c2 is real, this is (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) ) = - (2/4)= -0.5.

Similarly, c2 c1^* is (-sqrt(2)/2)(sqrt(2)/2) )= -0.5.

So the cross terms are 0.5 e^{-2 alpha^2} ( |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) multiplied by (-0.5 each?), no. Wait, the cross terms in rho are c1 c2^* |alpha><-alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2} and c2 c1^* | -alpha><alpha| e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So in rho, the cross terms are:

(c1 c2^* e^{-2 alpha^2}) |alpha><-alpha| + (c2 c1^* e^{-2 alpha^2}) | -alpha><alpha|.

Which with the numbers becomes:

(-0.5 e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) |alpha><-alpha| + (-0.5 e^{-0.5}) | -alpha><alpha|.

Wait, because alpha is 0.5, so 2 alpha^2 is 0.5.

So e^{-0.5} is about 0.6065.

So putting it all together, rho is:

[0.5 |alpha><alpha| + 0.5 |-alpha><-alpha| -0.5 e^{-0.5} ( |alpha
