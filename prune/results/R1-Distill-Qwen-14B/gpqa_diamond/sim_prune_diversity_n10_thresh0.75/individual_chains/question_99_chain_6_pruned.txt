Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one fits the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the IR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because their O-H stretches are very broad. Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong C=O peak around 1700, so that fits with the broad O-H. So, the compound is likely a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR doesn't show any vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, probably just single bonds. That makes sense because the IR didn't show any peaks for alkenes either, like around 1650 cm⁻¹ for C=C. So, no alkenes here.

Next, the NMR has several signals. One of them is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's think about splitting patterns and what they tell us about the neighboring protons.

Starting with the doublet of triplets of quartets. Each splitting indicates neighboring protons. So, a quartet suggests that a proton is next to a CH2 group (since a CH2 has two H's, leading to a triplet, but wait, maybe not. Wait, quartet is splitting due to two neighboring groups. Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, splitting patterns arise from neighboring H's. The first thing is the splitting is determined by the number of neighboring H's. Let's break down the terms.

A quartet (quartet) is when a proton is next to a CH2 group (since each H in CH2 would split the peak, leading to n+1 peaks, so 2+1=3 peaks? Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, quartet is four peaks, which comes from three neighboring H's. Oh right, n+1 where n is the number of neighboring H's. So quartet = 3 neighboring H's. So, if it's a quartet, the proton is next to a CH3. Because a CH3 has three H's, which would cause a quartet.

Wait, but that gives a quartet. So if a proton is next to a CH3, it becomes a quartet. But in the case of a doublet of triplets of quartets, this is more complex. Let me think.

Wait, the splitting comes from each neighboring group. So each neighboring group's H's would split the peak into multiple peaks, and each split is a multiplet.

Alternatively, the splitting can be sequential. Let's take the first split: suppose a proton is split into a doublet by one neighboring group, and each of those peaks is further split by another group, leading to a triplet of doublets, etc.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about each option and see which one would fit the NMR data.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Wait, let me parse that. So the structure is:

CH2-COOH is attached to a CH2 group, but wait, maybe not. Let me write it out.

Actually, all four options are carboxylic acids, as each ends with COOH.

Looking at the
