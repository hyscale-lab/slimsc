Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined between 0 and L, and their energy levels are quantized. 

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). From what I recall, each particle's energy level depends on the quantum number n, and the energy is proportional to n² multiplied by that base E. So each particle's energy would be E * (n_i)², where n_i is the quantum number for each.

Wait, but wait. Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are determined by n and spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So for each n, up to two particles can occupy that energy level because there are two possible spin states.

So, let's think about how the particles fill the energy levels. The ground state would have the four particles in the lowest possible energy levels, each with the lowest possible n and different spins. 

Let me list the energy levels and how they get filled.

Each energy level is E multiplied by the square of the quantum number. So the energy levels are E*(1), E*(4), E*(9), E*(16), etc. But since each level can hold two particles (because of spin up and down), we need to figure out how the four particles fill these levels.

In the ground state, we'll fill the lowest levels first. The first level (n=1) can hold two particles, the next (n=2) can hold another two. So for four particles, two go into n=1 and two into n=2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, each n can have two particles, so for four particles, two n=1 (each with spin up and down) and two n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E*1²) + 2*(E*2²). Which is 2E + 8E = 10E. But wait, wait, no, wait. No, because each particle's energy is E*(n_i)^2. So
