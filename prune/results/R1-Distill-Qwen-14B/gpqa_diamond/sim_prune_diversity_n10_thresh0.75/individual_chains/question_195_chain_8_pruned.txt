Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has Earth's radius, is in a circular orbit, and transits with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Now, we need to find the maximum orbital period a second planet can have, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size, so that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in circular orbits with the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So, what do I know about transits and occultations? Transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, from our point of view, which causes an increase in brightness because the planet's light is blocked. For both events to happen, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star. That probably means that the orbital period of the second planet needs to be such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows their conjunctions to happen at both points (front and back).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Actually, for a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star. For occultation, it must pass behind. So, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that its orbital period is a divisor of the first planet's period? Or maybe their periods have a certain ratio that allows the alignment for both events.

Wait, maybe it's about the synodic period. The time between successive transits is related to the orbital periods of the two planets. Oh, right! So, the synodic period is the time between similar configurations (like transits) as seen from Earth. The formula for the synodic period is 1/(1/P1 - 1/P2), where P1 and P2 are the orbital periods of the two planets around the star.

Wait, no. Wait, when you have two planets orbiting the same star, the time between transits of the same planet is given by the synodic period. But in this case, we're talking about two different planets. So, for the second planet to transit, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are commensurate so that they can align in the same line of sight as the star from Earth's perspective.

But the question is about the maximum period of the second planet that allows both transit and occultation events. So, perhaps the two planets must orbit such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows their conjunctions (transit and occultation) to occur.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For a planet to transit, it must lie in the same plane as our line of sight, and the star must be in the same line. Similarly, for the planet to occult, it must be behind the star, so again, same alignment.

But when you have two planets in the same system, their orbital periods need to be such that they can periodically
