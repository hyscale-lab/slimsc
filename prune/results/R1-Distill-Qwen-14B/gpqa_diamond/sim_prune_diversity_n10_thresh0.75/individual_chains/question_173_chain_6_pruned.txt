Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and uncertainty in energy. Hmm, I remember from my classes that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Yeah, that's right. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The question says an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Wait, how does position uncertainty relate to energy uncertainty?

Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation for momentum and position is Δp * Δx ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But how does that tie into energy?

Energy is related to momentum because E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So maybe I can connect the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy.

Let me think. The minimum uncertainty would occur when Δp is as small as possible, so using the Heisenberg equation, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Then, substituting this into the energy equation, ΔE would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Is the uncertainty in energy directly calculated from the uncertainty in momentum? So, ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). That makes sense because E = p²/(2m), so a small change in p would lead to a small change in E, proportional to (Δp)^2.

Right. So first, I need to calculate Δp. Let's plug in the numbers. 

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. The position uncertainty Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9). Let me compute that denominator first: 2 * 0.1e-9 is 2
