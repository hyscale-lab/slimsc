Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral.

Wait, what's mCPBA? Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, does it depend on the stereochemistry of the alkene?

So for each reaction, the starting material is either (E) or (Z) oct-4-ene. Let's consider each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Since mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides, and for alkenes with different stereochemistry, the epoxidation can lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The alkene structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No wait, no. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, actually, oct-4-ene is CH
