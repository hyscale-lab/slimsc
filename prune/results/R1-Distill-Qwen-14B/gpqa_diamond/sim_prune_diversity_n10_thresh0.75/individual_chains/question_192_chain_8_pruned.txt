Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. But wait, it's also at a distance l from the cavity's center. Oh, and the angle between l and s is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, so point P is definitely outside the conductor.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think that means it doesn't have any net chargeâ€”it's neutral. But when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute, right?

Wait, when a charge is placed inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge. But wait, in this case, the conductor itself is neutral. So the inner cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner has -q. That way, the total remains zero.

Wait, no, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when we add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part inside the cavity) must have -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor as a whole now has a charge of +q on the outside. Because the net charge of the conductor was zero, but +q inside the cavity induces -q on the inner surface, so the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero? Wait, no. Wait, conductor's net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer must have +q, making the total conductor's charge zero. Because (-q) + (+q) = 0. But wait, the cavity has +q, so the conductor's net charge is zero because it's uncharged. So inner surface has -q, outer has +q.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The conductor is neutral. When we put a charge +q in the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q. Because the cavity's charge creates an electric field, and the conductor's free electrons move to cancel the field within the conductor. So the inner surface must have -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, so inner surface (-q) + outer surface (+q) = 0. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q
