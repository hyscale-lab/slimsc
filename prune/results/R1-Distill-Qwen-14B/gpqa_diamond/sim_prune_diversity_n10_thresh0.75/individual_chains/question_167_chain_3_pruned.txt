Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which usually makes it non-Gaussian. But the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy.

The non-Gaussianity is measured by del_b, which is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and the reference Gaussian state tau. So del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, but the von Neumann entropy is S = -trace(rho ln rho). So if del_b is the difference between the entropy of rho and tau, that would be S(rho) - S(tau). Because del_b would be [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]? No, wait, wait. Let me think: the expression given is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh, wait, that's actually ( S(rho) - S(tau) ) multiplied by negative? Because von Neumann entropy is negative of that trace. So S(rho) = -trace(rho ln rho), and similarly for tau. So if del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), then that's ( -S(rho) ) - ( -S(tau) ) ) = S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] = ( -S(rho) + S(tau) ) ), so del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Wait, that's positive if tau is more mixed than rho.

But wait, actually, I might be getting this wrong. Let me double-check the definition. The question says the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's equal to ( - S(rho) ) - ( - S(tau) ) ) = (S(tau) - S(rho)). So del_b is S(tau) - S(rho).

But wait, non-Gaussian states are supposed to have higher entropy if they're more non-Gaussian? Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe del_b is defined as the difference in the other direction. I'll have to proceed with the given formula.

The problem gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So first, let's compute N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let me compute that.

Phi is -pi/4. So 2phi is -pi/2. Sin( -pi/2 ) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2), alpha is 0.5. So alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So
