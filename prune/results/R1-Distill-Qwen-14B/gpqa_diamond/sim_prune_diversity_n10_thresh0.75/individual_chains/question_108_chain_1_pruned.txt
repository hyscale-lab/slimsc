Okay, so I've got this question about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy due to the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and m is small. B is given as 1 Tesla. 

First, I remember that paramagnetic effects come from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (~2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the problem says m is small. So m could be 0 or ±1, I guess, since m typically ranges between -l and +l, and for small l, like l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1, 0, +1.

The paramagnetic coupling term would then be related to the expectation value of H, which would be ⟨H⟩ = -⟨μ⟩·B. Since the magnetic moment is quantized, the expectation value depends on m. But wait, in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split, and the coupling term would be proportional to m.

Wait, but the question is about the magnitude of the paramagnetic term compared to the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is the energy difference between two energy levels, like between n=1 and n=2 or something. The hydrogen atom's energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula, and the transition with λ=0.4861 μm is probably the Balmer series. Let me think: the Balmer series is for transitions ending at n=2. So, for example, the transition from n=3 to n=2 emits light with wavelength about 0.656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm, which I think corresponds to the n=4 to n=2 transition. Let me check: the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. The wavelength λ is given by 1/λ = R (1/(2^2) - 1/(n^2)). For λ=486 nm, which is about 486e-9 meters. Let's compute 1/λ: approximately 2.057e6 m^-1. So 2.057e6 = R (1/4 - 1/n²). Plugging in R=1.097e7 m^-1, wait, wait, wait, no: 1.097e7 m^-1 is about 1.1e7. Wait, 1/λ is about 2.057e6. So 2.057e6 = (1.097e7)(1/4
