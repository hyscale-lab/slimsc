Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, but their periods are different. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. So, the time between two primary eclipses is the orbital period. That makes sense.

Then, they talk about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. I remember that in a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The RV method measures the Doppler shift as the stars move towards and away from us, so the amplitude of these shifts relates to their velocities.

Wait, I think the RV amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. But how exactly? Oh right, the more massive star would have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving slower. Because the less massive star has to move more to balance the system. So, the two RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses.

Let me think. The mass function comes into play here. The formula I vaguely remember is something like M = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG), but wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the masses, considering their velocities.

Wait, the center of mass requires that M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because in the center of mass, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. Since K is proportional to velocity, and velocity is 2πa/P, so K1 = (2π a1)/P, K2 = (2π a2)/P. So M1 a1 = M2 a2 → M1/M2 = a2/a1. But K1 = (2π a1)/P, K2 = (2π a2)/P. So K1/K2 = a1/a2 → a1 = (K1/K2) a2. So substituting into M1/M2 = a2/a1 = K2/(K1). Therefore, M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, that seems important. So for each system, the mass ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio. So for system_1, M1a / M2a = K2a / K1a.

So for system_1, the two stars have K1=10 and K2=5. So the mass ratio M1a/M2a = K2a/K1a =5/10=0.5. So M1a =0.5 M2a. The total mass of system_1 is M1a + M2a = 0.5 M2a + M2a = 1.5 M2a.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15 and K2=10. So M1b/M2b =10/15=2/3. So M1b= (2/3) M2b. The total mass of system_2 is M1b + M2b = (2/3 M2b) + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So we need to find (M1_system) / (M2_system).

But wait, I think I need to tie the periods into this. Because the mass isn't just from the velocities; the period affects the mass calculation. Because the mass function from radial velocities also depends on the period and the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, right, the formula for the mass of a binary system using radial velocities is given by the mass function. The formula is:

M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2π G) )

But wait, actually, it's more precise to say that the mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) ) = ( (K1 P )^3 ) / (2π G) )

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I recall that the formula for the mass of the system (M1 + M2) is given by ( (4 π² ) / G ) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P². But since a1 and a2 are related to the velocities, maybe I can find a relation between the two systems.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the system is related to the sum of the masses, which can be derived from the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2π G )

Where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity, and P is the orbital period.

But wait, for each star, we have their own K. So for a binary system, each star's K relates to the other's mass. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the total mass (M1 + M2) can be found using the formula:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² G)⁻¹ * ( (a1 + a2)³ ) * (4 π² / G) )

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the masses from the radial velocities. Let me think: the mass function for each star is given, but the sum of the masses can be found when you have both K1 and K2.

Wait, I remember that when you have both velocity amplitudes, K1 and K2, the mass function for each star is the same when you account for the mass ratio. So for each system, M1 + M2 = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G ) * (1 / sin^3 i ), but if the inclination is the same, perhaps we can compare the systems.

Wait, but unless we know the inclination, which we don't. But since both systems are eclipsing binaries, their inclination must be close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So we can ignore the inclination angle in this comparison.

So, for each system, the total mass would be proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G ), but since G and 2 π are constants, and assuming that the same instrument is used, the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

The mass function is (M^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M + m)^2 ) ) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

But wait, that's for each component. So, for M1 and M2, you have:

f(M1) = (M1^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K2^3 P )/(2 π G )

Similarly, f(M2) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it mixed up. Let me double-check.

In a binary system, each star's mass can be found using its velocity amplitude. The mass function for star 1 (M1) is given by:

f(M1) = ( (K1)^3 P ) / (2 π G ) ) = ( (M2)^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for star 2:

f(M2) = ( (K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G ) ) = ( (M1)^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But if we take the ratio f(M1)/f(M2) = (M2^3) / (M1^3) ) → (K1^3 P)/(K2^3 P) ) = (M2^3)/(M1^3)

Which simplifies to (K1/K2)^3 = (M2/M1)^3 → (K1/K2) = (M2/M1). Hmm, that's a useful relation.

Wait, let me write that again. From the mass functions:

f(M1) = [K1^3 P ]/(2 π G) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, f(M2) = [K2^3 P ]/(2 π G ) = (M1^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Taking the ratio f(M1)/f(M2) → [K1^3 / K2^3] = [M2^3 / M1^3 ]

Which implies (K1/K2)^3 = (M2/M1)^3 → K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Ah, so M1 is the mass of the star with velocity K1, and M2 is the mass with velocity K2.

So for each system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes.

So in system_1: K1 = 10, K2 =5 → M1 = (5/10) M2 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but wait, that's within system_1. But system_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. So how does the period come into play?

Ah, because the mass function depends on both the velocity and the period. So the actual mass isn't just based on the velocities but also the period.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach this differently.

The formula for the mass of the binary system (M1 + M2) is given by:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. The formula for the mass in a binary system using radial velocities is:

M1 + M2 = ( (4 π²) / ( G ) ) * ( a^3 ) / P²

Where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But how does 'a' relate to the velocities?

Well, the orbital velocity is v = 2 π a / P. So for each star, their velocity is K1 = (2 π a1 ) / P, K2 = (2 π a2 ) / P.

But since the two stars orbit the center of mass, a1 * M1 = a2 * M2 → a1 = (M2 / M1) a2.

And since a1 + a2 = a, the total semi-major axis. So a = a1 + a2 = (M2/M1) a2 + a2 = a2 (1 + M2/M1) = a2 ( (M1 + M2) / M1 )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful immediately.

Alternatively, considering that K1 = (2 π a1 ) / P, and K2 = (2 π a2 ) / P, so K1 + K2 = 2 π (a1 + a2)/ P = 2 π a / P.

So a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π )

Substituting this into the mass formula:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G P² )

Substituting a:

a = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π )

So a^3 = [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]^3

Plug that into the mass formula:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² ) / ( G P² ) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]^3

Let me compute this:

= (4 π²) / (G P²) ) * ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2 π)^3 ) )

Simplify denominator: 2^3 is 8, π^3.

= (4 π²) * (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( G P² * 8 π^3 )

= (4 π²) * (K1+K2)^3 P ) / ( G * 8 π^3 )

The 4 and 8: 4/8 = 1/2.

π² in numerator, π^3 in denominator → 1/π.

So:

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) * (1/2) ) / ( G π )

So M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

So, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

That's a key point. So the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 multiplied by the period.

So for each system:

Mass_system ∝ (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

So let's compute the mass for each system.

System_1: K1=10, K2=5 → sum is 15. P=2 years.

Mass1 ∝ (15)^3 * 2.

System_2: K1=15, K2=10 → sum is 25. P=1 year.

Mass2 ∝ (25)^3 * 1.

So the ratio Mass1 / Mass2 = [ (15^3 * 2 ) ] / [ (25^3 *1) ]

Compute that.

15^3 is 3375.

25^3 is 15625.

So 3375 *2 = 6750.

15625 *1 = 15625.

So the ratio is 6750 / 15625 = ?

Let me compute this.

6750 ÷ 15625.

Well, 15625 is 5^6 (5^4 is 625, 5^5=3125, 5^6=15625).

6750 / 15625 = (6750 ÷ 25) / (15625 ÷25 )= 270 / 625.

270 ÷625 = 0.432.

So the ratio is approximately 0.432. Looking at the options, A is ~0.4, D is ~0.7. So 0.432 is closer to 0.4, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I get the formula right? Because I thought that the mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So Mass = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G) → so the proportionality is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the period is in years. But in the formula, I think the period should be in SI units (seconds) because G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

But since both systems are calculated with the same formula, the units would cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio would indeed be ( ( (K1+K2 for sys1 ) / (K1+K2 sys2) )^3 ) * (P1 / P2).

So let's compute that.

sys1: (15)^3 * 2.

sys2: (25)^3 * 1.

15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

So (3375 *2 ) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 / 15625.

Compute 6750 ÷ 15625.

Let me compute 6750 ÷ 15625.

15625 × 0.4 = 6250.

6750 -6250=500.

So 0.4 + (500 /15625 ) → 500/15625 = 0.032.

So 0.432, as I thought before.

So the ratio is approximately 0.432, which is about 0.43.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

0.43 is closest to option A, which is ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Wait another thing. Let me think: does the mass ratio have to be M1 / M2 as per the question. Because the problem says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio is 0.43, that would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so it's less massive. Wait, but the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio is 0.43, that would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times system_2's mass, i.e., system_1 is less massive. So system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

Wait, but wait: the question is phrased as "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the mass ratio (system_1 / system_2) is 0.43, that means system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So it's less massive. So system_1 is approximately 0.43 times the mass of system_2. Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is 0.4, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the computation?

Mass1 is 15^3 * 2 = 3375 *2=6750.

Mass2 is 25^3 *1=15625.

So 6750 /15625 = 6750 ÷ 15625.

Let me compute 6750 ÷ 15625.

15625 × 0.4 is 6250.

6750-6250=500.

So 500 /15625 = 0.032.

So 0.4 + 0.032=0.432.

Yes, correct.

So the answer should be approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A: ~0.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check the mass formula again.

Wait, the formula I derived earlier is M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / ( 2 π G )

So the mass is directly proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

So the ratio is ( (15)^3 *2 ) / ( (25)^3 *1 )

Which is (3375 * 2) / (15625 *1 ) = 6750 /15625 = 0.432.

So the factor is 0.43, so system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

So the answer is A) ~0.4.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system masses. The total mass of a binary system is proportional to \((K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P\), where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the RV amplitudes of the two stars, and \(P\) is the orbital period.

### Step 1: Mass Proportional to \((K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P\)
For system_1:
- \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), \(K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\).
- Orbital period \(P = 2 \, \text{years}\).
- Total mass of system_1 is proportional to \((15)^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750\).

For system_2:
- \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\), \(K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\).
- Orbital period \(P = 1 \, \text{year}\).
- Total mass of system_2 is proportional to \((25)^3 \cdot 1 = 15625 \cdot 1 = 15625\).

### Step 2: Compute the Mass Ratio
The ratio of the total masses of system_1 to system_2 is:
\[
\text{Mass Ratio} = \frac{\text{Mass of system_1}}{\text{Mass of system_2}} = \frac{6750}{15625}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Ratio
\[
\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432.
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 is approximately \(0.432\), meaning system_1 is about \(0.43\) times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is \(0.4\).

### Final Answer
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.

Answer: A
