Alright, so I have this physics problem to solve about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. Let me think about what I know.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is such that the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation. So for a dipole along z, the maximum would be at θ=90 degrees, but wait, the question is about a spheroidal distribution. Maybe it's a quadrupole or something else. Or perhaps it's an electric dipole.

Wait, let me recall. The general form of the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The power radiated is proportional to (d²p/dt²)^2, where p is the dipole moment. But in the far field or radiation zone, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle θ.

The radiation pattern for an electric dipole is such that the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees where sinθ is 1. So the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1, which is 90 degrees. Let me think about the solid angle.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is given by the intensity, which for a dipole is I = (something)
