Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain time t, given a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup involves the origin, the field point r, and the vector d from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

I remember that potentials are usually determined using Coulomb's law for static charges and then considering the time-varying fields for moving charges. But wait, this is about the retarded potentials, right? Because the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr.

So the scalar potential V typically comes from the electric field, and the vector potential A from the magnetic field. For a static charge, V is straightforward: it's (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point where we're measuring the potential. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated.

Wait, the problem gives options where V might have terms involving d*c minus or plus the dot product of d and v. Oh right, d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So the distance would be |d|, but I think the exact expression might involve d·v as a relativistic correction term because of the motion of the charge affecting the potential.

The expression for V in retarded potential theory includes a term like 1/(c² (something)). I recall that when the charge is moving, the potentials involve a sort of "retarded time" where the effects are delayed due to the finite speed of light. So the denominator in the potential expressions would include terms that account for the motion of the charge at the retarded time.

Looking at the options, options C and D have denominators with terms like dc - d·v or dc + d·v. Wait, d is a vector, so I'm not sure about the units here. Oh, but wait, the dimensions must work out. Let's think. The denominator in the V expression in option C is (d c - d·v), but wait, d·v has units of m²/s.
