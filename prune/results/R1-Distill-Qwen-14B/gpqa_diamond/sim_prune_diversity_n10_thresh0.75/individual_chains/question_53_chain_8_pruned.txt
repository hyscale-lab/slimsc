Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. I remember that di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring.

The IR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a strong absorption around 1730-1750 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's one substituent accounted for – an ester group. But wait, the compound is di-substituted, so there's another substituent on the benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the NMR indicates two aromatic signals, which suggests that the substituents are either in the para position (which would split the ring into two sets of equivalent Hs) or maybe some other arrangement. Wait, or maybe the substituents are such that they cause the ring to have two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each with their own signal. For example, if the substituents are not symmetrical and cause the ring to have two different environments for the Hs. Hmm.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so this suggests the presence of an ethylene group. The splitting could indicate coupling with adjacent protons. For example, in an ester group, there's a carbonyl, then an ethylene might be connected. Wait, esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R' or wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. Oh wait, no, the structure is RCOOR'. So for example, if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acetate group. Wait, but the substituents are on the aromatic ring.

Wait, the substituents could be an ester group (like OAc) and another group. Wait, but another substituent? Let me think.

The two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, one is a doublet of quartets. That sounds like a trans coupling. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, while the quartet (doublet of quartets) suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Or wait, maybe it's something else.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. Since the aromatic ring is di-substituted, perhaps each substituent is contributing a methyl. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester with a methyl group and another substituent is a methyl group attached directly.

Wait, but wait, the problem says, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent would bring their own groups. So let's think about possible substituents.

Ester group is one substituent. The other substituent must bring something else. Let's think about the ester: the general formula for an ester is RCOOR'. So if the substituent is, say, an ethyl acetate group (like OAc), but wait, that's an acetyl group attached via an oxygen. So maybe the substituent is O-CO-R, where R is another alkyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two –CH3 signals. So if the ester is, say, methyl something, then the methyl from the ester would be one –CH3. Then, the other substituent might be another methyl group attached directly to the ring. But wait, that would make the ring have two substituents: an ester group (like O-CO-R) and a methyl group. But then, the ester group would be O-CO-R, where R could be, say, a methyl or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are not an est
