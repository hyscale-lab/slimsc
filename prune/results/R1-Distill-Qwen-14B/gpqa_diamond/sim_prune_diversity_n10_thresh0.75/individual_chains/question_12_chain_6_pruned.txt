Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. 

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a nu (neutrino, I assume it's a muon neutrino). The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies, probably for the mu and the neutrino.

Wait, so the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

But wait, neutrinos are almost massless. So the mass of the neutrino is negligible compared to the muon. So maybe the muon's momentum is much larger than the neutrino's? Or does it balance out because of the opposite directions?

Hmm, let's think about the energy and momentum conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's stationary. So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy (105.7 MeV), and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is nearly zero).

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = (K_mu + 105.7) + K_nu

Also, momentum conservation: the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) equals the neutrino's momentum (p_nu) because they're moving in opposite directions. So, p_mu = p_nu.

The energy of each particle is related to their momentum by the relativistic energy equation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're dealing in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c^2), this simplifies to E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ). 

So for the muon: E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2 )
And for the neutrino: E_nu = p_nu (since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p_nu * c, but in our units, E_nu = p_nu )

But since p_mu = p_nu = p, let's say. Let's set p_mu = p_nu = p.

So substituting into the energy equation:
139.6 = [sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ] + p

That's an equation with one unknown, p. Let me rearrange it:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

So, subtract p^2 from both sides:
(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 * p

Let me calculate the squares:

105.7^2 ≈ 11171.49
139.6^2 ≈ 19488.16

So plug those in:
11171.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p

Rearranging:
2*139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11171.49
Calculate the right side: 19488.16 - 11171.49 ≈ 8316.67

So 279.2 * p = 8316.67
Divide both sides by 279.2: p ≈ 8316.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV/c

Wait, so p is approximately 29.8 MeV/c.

So now, E_nu is p, which is 29.8 MeV. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but what
