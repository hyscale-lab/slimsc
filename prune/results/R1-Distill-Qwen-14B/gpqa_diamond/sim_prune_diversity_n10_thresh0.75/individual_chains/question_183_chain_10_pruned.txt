Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Wait, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus double bonds in a molecule. So I need to figure out the structure of the product and then calculate that.

First, let me draw the structure of the starting material. The parent is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Oh, wait, 5-vinyl would be the substituent at position 5. So, the positions are 2 (formyl), 3 (the double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Also, there's a carboxylic acid group on the cyclohexene.

Wait, no, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has double bond at 3. Position 2 is formyl, position 5 is vinyl. And since it's cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the COOH is probably at position 1, because in numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Alternatively, wait, the numbering might be such that the cyclohexene (double bond) is at position 3, and the substituents are 2 and 5.

So, structure-wise, the ring is six-membered. Starting with position 1: where is the COOH group? I think the carboxylic acid is at position 1 because the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps.

Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond is between C1 and C2 for cyclohexene. But in the name, it's 3-enecarboxylic acid, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So position 3 and 4 are double-bonded.

So the cyclohexene is numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C
