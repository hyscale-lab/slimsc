Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here? Because the problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just a distractor. Let's see.

The question mentions using the EW method under LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. But I'm not too sure about that part. Anyway, the key data given are the abundance ratios.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Oh wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given too. The Sun has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe the formula is written differently. Oh, actually, the usual scale is like [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. But I think the given values are in terms of 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) for the Sun. So for the Sun, it's 12 + log(nFe/H) =7.5 → So log(nFe/H) = 7.5-12 = -4.5 → so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = about 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg in the Sun: 12 + log(nMg/H) =7 → log(nMg/H) =7-12= -5 → nMg/H = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5. Same for Mg: Sun's [Mg/H] would be log(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Okay, so now I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I'm to find [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = ? Or maybe it's [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H
