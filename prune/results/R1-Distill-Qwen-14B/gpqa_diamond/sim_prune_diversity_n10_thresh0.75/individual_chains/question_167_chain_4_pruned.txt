Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. N is the normalization constant, which they provide as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Hmm, so first, I remember that Gaussian states are states like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that cannot be described by Gaussian Wigner functions, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can exhibit more complex quantum phenomena, like cat states.

The non-Gaussianity is being measured using relative entropy, which, in this context, I think relates to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state. So del_b is the relative entropy between rho (the non-Gaussian state) and tau (the Gaussian reference state).

Wait, but what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the way non-Gaussianity is calculated depends on which Gaussian state you compare against. Oh, maybe for the relative entropy, the reference state is the one that minimizes the distance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is taken as the thermal state or some other standard Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy between the given state and the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not too certain. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the original state. Because sometimes, the Gaussian state that's the 'best fit' is the one that matches the first and second moments of the non-Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the problem says that the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. That would be the Kullback-Leibler divergence from tau to rho. Wait, no, the KL divergence is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, it's trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), which is [S(rho) - S(tau)]. But that's not the KL divergence; it's the difference in von Neumann entropies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) from rho to tau is S(rho||tau) = S(rho) + S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the relative entropy between them. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem defines del_b as the
