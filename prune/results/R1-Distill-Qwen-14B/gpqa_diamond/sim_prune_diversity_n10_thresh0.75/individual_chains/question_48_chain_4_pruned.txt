Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that cyclohexanone undergoes several reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let me break down each reaction step by step.

First step: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that ketones can undergo halogenation, especially under certain conditions. Since cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, bromine probably adds across the carbonyl group. Oh wait, wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group (C=O). When you add bromine to a ketone, I think it's a type of addition reaction. But wait, wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol formation? Or is it the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for carboxylic acids. Oh wait, maybe it's a halogenation via an enolate? Or wait, perhaps it's a diels-alder type reaction? Or maybe it's just an addition of Br2 to the carbonyl, making a bromohydrin? No, wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone, and adding bromine... another possibility is that bromine adds to the carbonyl in an addition reaction, leading to a bromocyclohexanol? Wait, but cyclohexanone is (CH2)5COCH2, no, wait, no, cyclohexanone has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. When Br2 is added to a ketone, like cyclohexanone, perhaps it undergoes a 1,2-addition or a 1,4-addition (like in conjugated systems). Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a conjugated diene. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first step is a bromination via the enol mechanism. Enolates can form when a base is present, but the question says Br2 is added directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide formation, but that's with peracids like mCPBA. Hmm. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. Another possibility is that cyclohexanone undergoes a ring-opening bromination. No, wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, and adding bromine might lead to a di-substituted cyclohexane bromide. Wait, wait, maybe it's an example of a bromination via the aldol addition. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up what happens when ketones react with bromine. Oh wait, I can't look it up, so I have to think from what I know.

Wait, I recall that when ketones react with bromine in a basic condition, like in the presence of a strong base, it can lead to the formation of a bromide after some steps. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation
