Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. But wait, actually, no, I think the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. Oh right, the formula is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Are they uniformly spread out in space, or uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere? The question probably means uniformly in space, so the number density of stars is constant throughout the universe. But wait, the observable universe is only up to a certain distance, but I think in this problem, we're assuming that stars are uniformly distributed in all space, but we're observing them within a certain range.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax as a function of plx. So I need to relate the number of stars in a given parallax range to the parallax itself.

Parallax is a measure of distance. So for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Since plx = 1/d, the distance d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, the distance changes by dd = -d(plx)^-1. Wait, let me think about that. Let me make it precise.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the distance between plx and plx + dplx is the difference in d. Let me calculate the change in d when plx changes by dplx.

d = 1/plx. So, d(d) = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, that's the derivative. So the change in distance is approximately - (dplx) / (plx^2). But wait, that might be the differential. So, the corresponding distance range for a parallax range dplx is approximately d = Δd ≈ dplx / plx². Because the derivative dd/dplx = -1/(plx²), so Δd ≈ - (1/plx²) Δplx. But since we're considering a small range, the negative sign just indicates direction, but we're dealing with magnitudes here, so we can take the absolute value.

So, the distance range corresponding to a parallax range dplx is about d = dplx / plx².

Now, if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant, say n stars per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by the volume.

What's the volume corresponding to a particular distance range. Let's think in terms of spherical shells. Each shell at distance d with thickness dd has a volume of 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area times thickness. Surface area of a sphere is 4π d², so times thickness dd.

So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of parallax plx, not distance.
