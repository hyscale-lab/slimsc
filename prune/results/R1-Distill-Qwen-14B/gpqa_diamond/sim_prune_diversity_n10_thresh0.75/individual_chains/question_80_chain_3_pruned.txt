Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value a given DNA sequence produces based on some algorithm. The given examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I have to find out the value for ACAGTGACC. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, let me think. First, I need to figure out the pattern or the rule that the algorithm is using to convert the DNA sequences into numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So each letter represents a nucleotide. 

Looking at the examples:

AGG is a 3-letter sequence and the output is 115. TGCTGA is a 6-letter sequence with output 176.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide contributes a certain value, and the total is the sum of those values. Let's check that.

So for AGG: A, G, G.

If I can find the value each letter contributes, I can calculate it.

Let me denote A as a, T as t, C as c, G as g.

In AGG, sum is a + g + g = a + 2g = 115.
In TGCTGA, t + g + c + t + g + a = (t + a) + 2g + c = 176.

Hmm, but that's two equations with four variables. Not enough to solve directly. Maybe there's another pattern.

Wait, another approach: the output could be the sum of each base's position in the alphabet. Wait, A is the first letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. Let me calculate that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the letters are A, T, C, G. But in the alphabet, A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. So for AGG:

A (1) + G (7) + G (7) = 1 +7 +7 =15. But the output is 115. Doesn't match. So that's not it.

Another idea: Maybe each base's value is its own numerical value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me check.

AGG:1 +4 +4=9. Not 115. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe each base is assigned a two-digit number. Like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Let's see:

AGG:10 +40 +40 =90. Not 115.

Wait, maybe each base's value is a single digit, like A=1, T=5, C=3, G=7. Let me try.

AGG would be 1 +7 +7 =15. Not matching 115.

Hmm, not that. Maybe it's based on the molecular weight of each nucleotide. Because DNA is made of nucleotides, each with a certain molecular weight. Let me think about that.

The molecular weight of Adenine (A) is approximately 329.24 g/mol. Thymine (T) is about 288.23. Cytosine (C) is around 288.19, and Guanine (G) is about 345.21. Wait, but DNA is double-stranded, so each base is part of a pair. Wait, but these are the weights of the bases, but they are in pairs. Hmm, maybe each base contributes a certain number based on its weight.

Wait, but AGG has three bases: A, G, G. So their weights would be 329.24 + 345.21 + 345.21 = something like 329 + 345 +345 = 1019.24. No way that would be 115. So that's not it.

Hmm, another thought: maybe each base corresponds to a binary digit, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the number is built by treating each base as a digit in a base-4 number, but let's see.

Wait, the first example is 3 bases leading to 115. Let's see: 115 in base 10 is 115. If it's a base 4 number, what would that be? Wait, no, because base 4 digits go from 0 to 3, which doesn't match A, T, C, G. Maybe it's base 5? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each base is mapped to a number, and the sequence is treated as a number in a certain base. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps each nucleotide is converted to a digit, and the entire sequence is
