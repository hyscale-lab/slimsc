Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about expectation values of spin operators. I remember that spin-½ particles have states like up and down, and their expectation values can be calculated using the coefficients of the superposition state.

The problem says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So the state is a combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, σz is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of this operator. I think expectation values are linear, so I can separate this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Wait, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for each part, I'll compute each and sum them.

First, let's compute the expectation value of σz, then multiply by 10. Then compute the expectation of σx multiplied by 5.

Let me start with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is straightforward. The state is a linear combination, so the expectation value is the sum of the squares of the coefficients multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So for σz, the eigenvalues are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/4 = 0.75. So 0.25 *1 = 0.25, and 0.75*(-1) = -0.75. Adding these gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation of σz is -0.5. Multiply by 10 gives 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Next, the σx part. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its expectation value is a bit trickier because the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx.

Wait, but I can compute it using the state coefficients. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by |a|^2⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + a b*⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + b a*⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

Alternatively, since σx has off-diagonal elements, maybe there's a simpler way. Oh right, σx is Hermitian, and its expectation can be found using the state's components.

Wait, for spin-½ particles, the expectation of σx can be found with the formula: ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * (eigenvalue for |↑⟩ when considered in σx) + |b|^2 * (eigenvalue for |↓⟩) plus cross terms.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you compute ⟨σx⟩, you can express it as 2 times the real part of the product of the coefficients times the transition amplitudes.

Another approach is to write the density matrix and compute the expectation. But maybe a simpler way is to express the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx, or compute it directly.

Wait, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ would be the sum over all terms.

But perhaps a better way is to remember that for spin-½ systems, the expectation value of σx is 2 times the probability that the spin is in the right state when measured in the x-basis, minus 1. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the expectation value of σx is calculated as (a b* + a* b) multiplied by something. Let me think.

Let me write the state ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1; 0) and |↓⟩ is (0;1), ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ is a column vector with elements 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2.

The Pauli matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx times ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then, the expectation is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, which is the conjugate transpose of ψ times σx times ψ.

So compute ψ† σx ψ.

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiply by σx: [[0,1],[1,0]], so ψ† σx is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply by ψ: which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the product is (sqrt(3)/2)(0
