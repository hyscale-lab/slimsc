Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both orbits are circular and in the same plane.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that for a planet to transit (i.e., pass in front of the star from our point of view), the orbital plane must be edge-on enough. The impact parameter tells us how far the planet's path is from the center of the star's disk during transit. If the impact parameter is zero, the planet transits directly in front of the star's center. A higher impact parameter means it's further to the side.

But wait, what's the impact parameter exactly? Oh right, it's the distance in units of the star's radius. So if the impact parameter is 0.2, the planet's path is 0.2 times the star's radius away from the center of the star's disk.

Now, for a planet to transit, its orbit must be aligned such that the line of sight passes through the star's disk. The condition for transit is that the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) must be such that the planet's path doesn't miss the star entirely. But for occultation, which is when the planet passes behind the star from our view, the planet must also be close enough that when it goes behind the star, the star's gravity can cause it to be eclipsed (or occulted). Wait, no, actually, occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star, so the star must be larger in the sky than the planet's orbit. Or is that the other way around?

Wait, maybe I should think about the orbital distance and the size of the star and planet. For both transits and occultations to occur, the planet
