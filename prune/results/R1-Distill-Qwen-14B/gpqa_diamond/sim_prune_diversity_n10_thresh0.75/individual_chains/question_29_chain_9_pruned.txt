Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's all about.

So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. Then, they did EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene in all mutants. They found some changes in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, I remember that anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so the gene probably codes for a protein that produces this compound. If we mutate the gene, we might disrupt its function, thus stopping the production of the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change in the gene sequence. I need to figure out which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function.

First, I'll look at the original gene sequence and the mutants. Let me write down the original and each mutant to compare.

Original:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the changes:

Original has in the first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1: Changed CTC to CTA. So, position where CTC is becomes CTA. Let me count the nucleotides:

Original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT...

Mutant 1's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCT... So, the part after the initial ATG is TTT becomes TCT, then CTC becomes CTA? Wait, maybe I should look at the exact positions.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant's changes:

Original: Exon 1

Mutant 1: Let me see, the first part is ATGTTCTACGCT.

Wait, the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT... So after ATG comes TTT in the original, which is TTT. In Mutant1, it's TCT. So the second triplet is TTT -> TCT. That changes the amino acid from Phe (TTT) to Ser (TCT). Then, the next part is CTC in original, which is Leu. In Mutant1, it's CTA, which is also Leu since CTA is another Leu codon (Leu has several codons: CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG). So the amino acid is still Leu. So in Mutant 1, the first two codons are altered, but the amino acids might still be similar. Wait, but the original is TTT CTC, so the first codon is TTT (Phe), the second is CTC (Leu). In Mutant1, after ATG, first codon is TCT (Ser), second is CTA (Leu). So the first amino acid changes from Phe to Ser, which is a significant change. But the
