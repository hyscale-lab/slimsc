Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about how many of the listed stars would be detectable by ESPRESSO when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The detectability condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. It's used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method, right? But for this question, the key is figuring out which stars provide enough signal for a good S/N.

The stars are options a) to f), each with different properties. Let me list them:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Absolute V mag 15, 10 pc
d) Same abs mag 15, 200 pc
e) Same, 5 pc
f) Same, 50 pc

Wait, so options c, d, e, and f are all stars with the same absolute magnitude (15 mag) but different distances. So their apparent magnitudes will vary based on distance. Then a and b are specific stars, so I should probably look up their apparent magnitudes.

So first, I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitude (V) for each star because the S/N depends on the brightness as seen from Earth. The brighter the star (lower apparent magnitude), the more photons we get, leading to a higher S/N.

The formula to calculate apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs.

So for the stars with absolute V mag 15:

c) d=10 pc: m = 15 + 5*(log(10/10)) =15 +0=15 mag
e) d=5 pc: m=15 +5*(log(5/10))=15 +5*(log(0.5))=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505=13.495 approx 13.5.
f) d=50 pc: m=15 +5*(log(50/10))=15 +5*(1.69897)=15 +8.49485=23.49485, about 23.5 mag.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Oh yes! Because m = M +5*(log10 d) -5. So I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me correct that.

So for each star:

c) d=10 pc:
m =15 +5*log10(10) -5 =15 +5*1 -5=15+5-5=15. So m=15.

e) d=5 pc:
m=15 +5*log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897, so 5*0.69897=3.49485.

So m=15 +3.49485 -5=13.49485, about 13.5.

f) d=50 pc:
m=15 +5*log10(50) -5.

log10(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897=8.49485.

m=15 +8.49485 -5=18.49485, so about 18.5.

d) d=200 pc:
m=15 +5*log10(200) -5.

log10(200)=2.3010. 5*2.3010=11.505.

m=15 +11.505 -5=21.505, about 21.5.

Wait, I think I confused the formula earlier. So that's the correct way.

Now, for Canopus (option a) and Polaris (option b), I need their apparent magnitudes.

Canopus is a bright star. I remember it's the second brightest star in the sky.
