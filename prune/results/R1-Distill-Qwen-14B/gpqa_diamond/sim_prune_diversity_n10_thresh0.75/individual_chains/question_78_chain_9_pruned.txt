Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it creates both electric and magnetic fields. And these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, right? 

The question is giving me a setup: a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). At some time tr, the charge is at a position, and that's when the electromagnetic field is generated. The field is observed at a point r, and the vector d is the distance from where the field was generated to the observation point r. 

So, I think I need to recall the expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. From what I remember, the scalar potential is similar to the Coulomb potential but might have some time dependence if the charge is moving. Oh wait, but in the case of a static charge, V is just kq/r, where k is 1/(4πε₀). 

But wait, when the charge is moving, do I need to consider the retarded time? Because the fields are generated at an earlier time, so there's a delay. Oh right, the retarded time is when the fields are calculated based on the position of the charge at an earlier time. So the expressions for V and A should involve the charge's position and velocity at tr, which is earlier than t.

The scalar potential is usually given by something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r'|), but considering the retarded time, r' is the position at tr. But wait in this problem, the vector d is from the field generating point (at tr) to r. So d is r - r', I think. So the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ d), but I need to make sure about the dependencies.

Wait, but when considering the motion, like when the charge is moving, there might be a term involving the velocity or acceleration? Or is that for the magnetic vector potential? Oh right, the vector potential A is usually proportional to the velocity of the charge. 

Let me think about the expressions. I remember that the vector potential due to a moving charge can be written as A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (some terms involving d and the velocity). Also, the scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * something, but I'm not sure if it's just 1/d or if it's adjusted for time delays.

Wait, but when you have a moving charge, the electric field isn't just static anymore. The fields are affected by the motion, which introduces the magnetic field. So the vector potential must be related to the velocity of the charge.

Looking at the options:

Option A: V is 1/(4πε₀ r), which seems static, and A is v² over c² times V. That seems a bit odd because I remember vector potential is proportional to velocity, not velocity squared. So I'm not sure about A.

Option B: V is the same as in A, and A is v/(c²) times V. Hmm, that makes sense dimensionally. Because in SI units, the vector potential A has units of T·
