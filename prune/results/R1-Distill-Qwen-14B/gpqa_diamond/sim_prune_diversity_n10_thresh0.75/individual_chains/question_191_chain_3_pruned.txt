Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So, the cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group, right? So it's CH2-CH(CH2?) No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2?) Hmm, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2- attached? No, wait. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait. The substituent is the group attached to the main chain. So if it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CH with a double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)-. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2-? No. Let me draw it. The main chain is three carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1, 2, 3. So the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2=C-CH2- as a substituent. No, wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2CH2) with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the structure. The substituent is a propenyl group, specifically the allyl group attached via the middle carbon. So, the substituent is CH2=C-CH
