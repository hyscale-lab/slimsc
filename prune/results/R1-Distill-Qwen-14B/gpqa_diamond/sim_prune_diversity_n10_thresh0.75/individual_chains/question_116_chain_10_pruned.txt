Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A, which shows two signals in its proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, so maybe something like a CH2 group next to another CH2. The quartet suggests each proton is next to three others, like a CH2 adjacent to a CH3.

Looking at the integration: 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. Wait, 6H probably comes from two equivalent CH3 groups because 2*3=6. And the quartet 4H might be a CH2 group connected to something else. So maybe it's a structure like (CH2CH3)2CH2? Hmm, wait. Alternatively, consider ethyl groups. If there's a central CH2 connected to two CH2CH3 groups, that might give the quartet and triplet.

Wait, for example, if it's (CH2CH3)2CH2, the central CH2 would be split by two neighboring CH2CH3 groups. Let me think about the NMR. Each of the CH2CH3 groups has three Hs. The central CH2 would be next to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, maybe it's a different structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or perhaps a neopentyl-like structure.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely two sets of three Hs each, like two CH3 groups. Each CH3 in a triplet would mean each is adjacent to a CH2. So that would fit with an ethyl group, like in diethyl ether maybe? Or perhaps in a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to a CH2.

Wait, what about a diethyl group attached to something else. Let's think, for example, if the structure is CH2CH2(C H2CH3)2. No, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's a four-membered structure. Maybe a cyclohexane derivative with substituents.

Wait another thought: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests that each of those protons is next to three others, maybe like a CH2 adjacent to a CH3. So if you have a CH2 connected to two CH2 groups, but that doesn't fit... Hmm, perhaps it's a geminal diethyl group, like O(CH2CH3)2, but that would be for an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where a central CH2 is connected to two CH2CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH2CH3)2CH2, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 2-pentene structure or something similar. Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible compound A.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals. Let me think of a structure with two types of protons. Triplet at 0.9 ppm: maybe two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 ppm: a CH2 attached to another CH2 (so each proton is next to two others, but wait, quartet implies three neighbors. Wait, that's not matching. Let me think again.

Wait, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. That's 4 hydrogens in total. So perhaps two equivalent CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2, which would cause them to split into a quartet. Because each CH2 has two neighboring Hs on each side, but wait, that would lead to a triplet, not quartet. Hmm, maybe it's something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit.
