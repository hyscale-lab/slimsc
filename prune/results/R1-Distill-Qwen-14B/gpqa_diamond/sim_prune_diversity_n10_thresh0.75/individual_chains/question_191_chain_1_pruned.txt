Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the structure of product 4 after a series of reactions starting from 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let's break down each step one by one.

The starting material is a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. So the propenyl group is like CH2-C with a double bond, right? So the structure would be cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 and 5 positions.

First step: treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so maybe it deprotonates something. The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group. Deprotonating that would give an alkoxide. Then benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to an ether formation. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether. Wait, but wait, the hydroxymethyl is already attached to the cyclohexane ring. So after alkylation, the -O- would have a benzyl group attached. So the structure would become a cyclohexanone with a benzyl ether at position 3 and the propenyl group at 5.

Wait, the starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl), so after alkylation, it becomes 3-(benzyloxymethyl)? No, wait. Let me think again. The hydroxymethyl is CH2OH. Sodium hydride (NaH) deprotonates the OH to O-, which then reacts with benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) in an SN2 reaction. So the O- attacks the benzyl bromide, replacing Br-. So the product would be CH2-O-Bn, so the substituent is a benzyl ether. So the structure after step 1 (product 1) is 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting structure is 3-(hydroxymethyl),
