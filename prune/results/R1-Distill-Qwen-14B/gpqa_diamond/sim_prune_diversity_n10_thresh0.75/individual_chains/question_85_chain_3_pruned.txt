Okay, so I've got this science problem here about two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question is about finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, let's start by understanding what equilibrium temperature is. From what I remember, the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, and the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/ (1 + e) )^0.5. But since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero. So that part simplifies.

Wait, but wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo. So A is the same for both, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio. Good, that makes things a bit easier.

So the formula simplifies to T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), where a is the orbital radius of the planet. But wait, since each planet is at a different distance, their a values will be different. So the ratio of their temperatures will be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) times the ratio of the star's temperatures. But since the star is the same for both, that factor is 1, so it's sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because when you take the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. The formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1-A) )^0.5. Since A is same for both, and T_star is same, then T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So yes, the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So if I can find the ratio of
