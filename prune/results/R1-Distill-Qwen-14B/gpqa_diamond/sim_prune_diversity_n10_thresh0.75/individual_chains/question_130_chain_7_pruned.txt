Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting clouds of hydrogen using optical telescopes. Hmm, I remember that redshift is a big deal in astronomy because it tells us how much an object is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the farther away the object is.

The question is about neutral hydrogen clouds absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength. Lyman alpha is around 1216 Angstroms, right? I think that's in the ultraviolet range. Wait, but the question is about optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't see that. So the light we receive from these quasars would have their Lyman alpha emission shifted into the optical range if the redshift is high enough.

So the idea is that the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms, but if it's moving away (high redshift), the wavelength stretches. We need to find the minimum redshift where this shifted wavelength is still in the optical range observable by ground-based telescopes.

Wait, what's the optical range? I think visible light goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, the question says "optical ground-based telescopes." I should check what the typical range is for optical telescopes. I remember that they can observe from roughly 300 nm (near UV) up to about 2500 nm (near infrared), but maybe more conservatively, visible light is 400-700 nm. But sometimes, optical includes a bit beyond that, like up to 1000 nm or so.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. If the quasar is at redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1 + z). So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We need to find the minimum z such that lambda_obs is within the range observable by optical telescopes. Let's say the maximum wavelength that optical can detect is around 1000 nm (1000 Angstroms is 100 nm, wait no, waitâ€”wait, I'm getting confused
