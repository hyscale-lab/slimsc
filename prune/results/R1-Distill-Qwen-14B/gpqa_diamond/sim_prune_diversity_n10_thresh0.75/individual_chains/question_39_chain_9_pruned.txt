Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The setup is that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. Each particle can move along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, none were found for x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. The normalization condition is the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space equals 1.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function, right? The real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we take the absolute square, it's the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So the absolute square is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (-0.5)². Which simplifies to (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait a minute, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. For the wave function to be properly normalized, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of the absolute square must equal 1.

Wait, but wait another thing. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So since the wave function is complex, the normalization integral is the integral over x from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So the integral is the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but let me think about that again. The wave function is ψ(x) = real part + imaginary part. So the absolute square is (real part)^
