Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me get that right. Oh yeah, when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference. So one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 0.6c - 0.5c is 0.1c. Now the denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) * (c²/c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So that's roughly 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a sign that those are the possible answers for the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy of the system. I remember that each astronaut's energy should be their relativistic energy. So each has energy E = gamma * m c². Wait, but wait, the masses are different. The first astronaut has mass 2m and the second 3m.

So compute each energy separately and add them.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute for each:

For the first astronaut (0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = Gamma1 * 2m * c² → 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) → 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = Gamma2 * 3m c² → 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option D says 5 mc², which is less than what I calculated.

So putting it together, relative speed is about 0.14c and total energy is about 5.96 mc². So the correct option should be C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]
Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]
Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
For the first astronaut (\(v = 0.6c\), mass \(2m\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]
For the second astronaut (\(v = 0.5c\), mass \(3m\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]
The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]
This matches the value \(5.96m c^2\) in the options.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy of the system is \(5.96m c^2\). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
