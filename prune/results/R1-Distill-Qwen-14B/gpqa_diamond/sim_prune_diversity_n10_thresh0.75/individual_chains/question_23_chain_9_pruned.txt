Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The researcher checked using TLC and saw two new spots. So, the reactant spot is diminishing, and two products are formed. I need to figure out which options are possible products.

First, I should probably sketch out the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-). The substituent attached to the oxygen is a butenyl group. Butenyl means there's a double bond somewhere. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure of that group would be CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: but is four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 when counting from the substituent. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But wait, no. Because the substituent is on position 1. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, numbering from the substituent (the benzene is attached to the first carbon). So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's number the substituent as starting from the benzene. So the substituent is: 1-O-benzene, then 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

The substituent is (CH2) group attached to the oxygen, followed by a CH group, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps I should draw it. Let me try:

The substituent is
