Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Cope rearrangement question. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene undergoing a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement to form another 1,5-diene. The structure given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me visualize this structure.

Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the molecule is a norbornene with a substituent. The substituent is a vinyl group attached at the 2-position, and there's an azabicyclo, meaning one of the bridgehead carbons is nitrogen. Wait, wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a double bond at position 5.

Wait, the bicyclo system is [2.2.1], so the bridgeheads are 1, 2, and 4? I'm a bit confused. Let me sketch it out. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two with two carbons and one with one. So positions 1 and 4 are bridgeheads, and position 2 is another bridgehead with the nitrogen.

Wait, the bicyclo is numbered as follows: the bridgehead atoms are 1, 4, and another one. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to think about the Cope rearrangement.

In the Cope rearrangement, the diene needs to be conjugated. The starting material is a 1,5-diene. Wait, but in this case, the molecule has a bicyclic structure. So, the Cope rearrangement would involve the diene groups within that structure.

Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So, the substitution is at position 2, which is the nitrogen. The double bond is at position 5. So, the structure must have a double bond from C5 to C6 perhaps, and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to position 2.

Wait
