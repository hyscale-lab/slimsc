Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance in a specific region of the sky. The key piece of information given is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the relation is N ∝ 1/(parallax)^5.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth at different times of the year. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is approximately 1 divided by the distance (in parsecs). So, parallax (plx) = 1/d, where d is the distance. Alternatively, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Parallax is defined as the reciprocal of distance. So, plx = 1/d. That means as the distance increases, the parallax decreases, which makes sense because stars appear to move less against the background when they're farther away.

So, the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So, it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Oh, right, because the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So it's the differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential quantities. Let's consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. But wait, wait, the problem states that N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So, since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So, the number of stars in a region at distance d is proportional to d^5.

But wait, I'm trying to find how the number of stars changes with distance. So, perhaps it's the number per unit distance, which would be dN/dr. Or maybe it's the number per unit distance
