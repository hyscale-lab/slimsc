Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about an experiment where a researcher reacted a specific compound with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked the reaction progress using TLC and noticed that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. The options are given, and I need to figure out which products are possible.

Alright, let's break this down. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, wait, I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether group is O connected to a butenyl chain. But wait, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, right? So the structure is O attached to a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons, right? So it's but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-C double bond CH2? No, wait, numbering from the oxygen. So the oxygen is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So the structure is: O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? But with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but that would be but-1-en-1-yl if the double bond is between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Let me correct that. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is 3-en, which is the third carbon. So the structure is: the oxygen is attached to a butenyl group that has a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is
