Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two planets. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is transiting a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun. Its orbital period is 3 days. We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size, such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about transits and occultations. Hmm. Oh right, a transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light (if it emits any) is blocked from us. But wait, planets are usually not sources of light we can detect, so maybe the question is referring to when the planet is behind the star, so it's not visible (like in the day side if the planet reflects light). Or perhaps when the planet is eclipsed by the star, but since the planet is much smaller, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe the occultation here is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is no longer visible in our observations. For both events (transit and occultation) to occur, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star relative to us. Which would happen if their orbital periods are such that their positions allow this.

But wait, how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first one? Since the two planets are orbiting the same star, their orbital periods must satisfy certain conditions for their orbital paths to intersect from our perspective.

I think the key here is that for both transits and occultations to occur, the second planet must have an orbital period that's either longer or shorter than the first planet's, but such that their orbital speeds allow them to sometimes lap each other in a way that their positions relative to the star change enough for both events.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the second planet must orbit such that
