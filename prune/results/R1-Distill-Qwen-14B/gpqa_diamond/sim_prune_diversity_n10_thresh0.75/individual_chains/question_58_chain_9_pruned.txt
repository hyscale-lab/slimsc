Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's think this through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations and make the math blow up. By introducing a regularization scheme, you can make the infinities manageable and then remove them with renormalization.

So the options are A to D. Let me consider each one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. From what I've heard, string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. I think string theories don't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do because they're background-independent and maybe have a different way of handling high energies. Or wait, do they still require some form of regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions might still have divergences, but perhaps they are managed in a different way, like through the use of the string tension or other parameters. Or maybe not, maybe they still require some form of regularization. I'm not certain, so I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and the theory behaves more like a free theory. But I also remember that QCD calculations, especially loop calculations, can have divergent integrals. So they'd need regularization to handle those infinities. Techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization are used here. So QCD requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has been very successful, and it's a renormalizable theory. But renormalization implies that the theory has divergences that need to be handled through regularization. For example, in calculating electron self-energy or photon propagators, you get divergent integrals. So they must use regularization methods like cutoff regularization, dimensional regularization, etc. So yes, QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum theories. Classical electromagnetism is a completely deterministic theory without the infinities that quantum theories encounter. You don't have to deal with renormalization in the classical case. For instance, in Maxwell's equations, even point charges are handled without the need to deal with divergent integrals. So in classical ED, you don't have to regularize because there are no divergences arising from quantum loops or other such phenomena. So D might be the correct answer.

So putting it all together. The question is which theory never requires regularization. QED and QCD require it because they're quantum field theories with divergences. Superstring theory might still need some form, but I'm not as sure. But wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory of gravity and strings, so it probably deals with high energies and might require regularization. But wait, string theory is background-dependent? No, some versions are background-independent. Alternatively, perhaps in string theory, certain approaches like lightcone quantization require regularization, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle. Regularization is needed when you have divergences in loop integrals. In a theory that doesn't have such divergences, you don't need regularization. Which of these theories is finite, meaning no divergences? I think that in string theory, the perturbative series is better behaved. Because in string theory, the amplitude calculations involve integrals over the worldsheet and higher-genus surfaces. But I'm not sure if they lead to the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Alternatively, perhaps string theory doesn't have the same UV divergences that QFT does, which would mean it doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but I remember that
