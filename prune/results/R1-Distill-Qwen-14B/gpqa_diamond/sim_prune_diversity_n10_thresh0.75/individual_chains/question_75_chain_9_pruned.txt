Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. The question gives me the DNA sequence they used, and I need to look for possible issues in it.

First, the setup: they introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. HA tags are usually added to proteins to help with purification, so the construct should include the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, which is the plus strand, I need to check if the reading frame is correct and if there are any stop codons introduced. The presence of an early stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Let me break down the sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, I should look for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) that might have been introduced during the HA tag addition or elsewhere.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus. So the sequence starts with the HA coding sequence, then continues with GADD45G. If the HA sequence has a stop codon, that's bad. Alternatively, maybe the GADD45G sequence has a premature stop codon.

But looking at the given sequence, perhaps the issue is with the frame. Let me think: the HA tag is a short peptide, so the coding sequence for HA should be in frame with the GADD45G.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag isn't correctly added, but the problem is more about the construct's sequence leading to no protein.

Wait, another thought: when they added the HA tag, perhaps they didn't include a proper linker or the correct frame, leading to a frame shift. If the HA tag's coding sequence isn't in frame with the GADD45G, that could cause a frameshift, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from that point on, possibly introducing a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence has a stop codon. Let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

Wait, I see a TGA in there. Let me look for the exact positions. Scanning the sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking through each codon, starting from ATG, so in triplets:
