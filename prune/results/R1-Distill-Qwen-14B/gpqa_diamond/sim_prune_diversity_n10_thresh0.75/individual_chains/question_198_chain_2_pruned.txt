Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. We're given the stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, stability constants. Right, stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached. So which complex is that? Let me think. The complexes are Co(SCN)n^2- or something like that. For Co(II), the possible complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^-, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^+, and [Co(SCN)4]^{2+} perhaps. Or maybe the first complex is [CoSCN]^2- (n=1), then [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2), etc. 

Wait, the stability constants are given in order β1 to β4. So each β corresponds to the nth complex. So β1 is for the 1:1 complex, β2 for 2:1, and so on. So the question is about the [Co(SCN)₂]^(0) complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex, meaning two SCN- ligands. So we need the fraction of this complex compared to all Co species.

To find the percentage, I think we need to calculate the distribution of each complex and then find the proportion of the dithiocyanato one.

The stability constant β for a complex [ML_n]^k is given by β = [ML_n]/([M][L]^n). So for each complex, the concentration is [ML_n] = β_n [M][L]^n.

But since all these complexes are in equilibrium, we can model their concentrations using the stability constants and the initial concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

Wait, the initial concentration of Co²+ is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. So the total Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN is 0.1 M, but some of it will be tied up in complexes.

But how to calculate the fraction of each complex?

I remember that when multiple complexes are possible, their concentrations can be determined using the stability constants and the initial concentrations.

The general approach is to consider the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, and then normalize by the total concentration.

Wait, yes. The fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constant
