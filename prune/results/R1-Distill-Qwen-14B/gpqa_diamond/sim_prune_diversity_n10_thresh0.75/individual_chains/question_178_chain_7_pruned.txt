Alright, so I've got this question here about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, let's break it down step by step. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable.

First, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are part of the Dirac algebra, and their commutator often appears in expressions involving angular momentum or other tensor structures.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to recall how to determine the mass dimension of coupling constants in a Lagrangian. The rule is that the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Breaking down each part of the term: ψ̄ is the Dirac adjoint of ψ. Each ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2, so ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2. Similarly, the other ψ in the term has dimension 3/2 as well.

Now, σ_{μν} is a term involving the commutator of γ matrices. Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they're just matrices with no mass scaling), the entire σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well. So, the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have a dimension of 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. But wait, ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, and ψ is another 3/2: so 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then, the F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. For electromagnetism, F has dimension 2 because the field tensor is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and each derivative has dimension 1, so F is [∂]^2 times A, which is dimension 1, so F^2 would be 3, but wait, no—what's the dimension of F itself? Each derivative is mass dimension 1, and A is dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, so A must have same dimension as ∂, which is 1). So F is ∂ A, so each index gives a derivative, so F has dimension 1 (from ∂) plus 1 (from A) = 2.

Wait, so F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the term ψ̄ σ F would be the product of the three terms: ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So in total, the term is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. But wait, the Lagrangian
