Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus here is on two parts, A and B, which are about which compounds exhibit certain properties.

First, the question defines that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. But the question is about two specific properties: tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Hmm, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in an isomerism. This usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from one atom to another adjacent one, changing the structure. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a hydrogen moves from an oxygen to a carbon, changing the structure between keto and enol forms.

So, benzoquinone. I think benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Quinones generally have two carbonyl groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. Now, benzoquinone can have tautomerism because it can form enol tautomers, similar to how cyclohexane-dione might. Wait, but wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups that are conjugated. But can it undergo tautomerism? Alternatively, maybe it can form a dienol structure, but I'm not sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's symmetric. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Well, for a compound to undergo tautomerism, it needs to have two adjacent atoms where a hydrogen can shift. For example, in a diketone like cyclohexane-1,2-dione, the hydrogen can shift from the carbonyl carbon to an adjacent oxygen, forming an enol. But in trione, with three ketones, I'm not sure. Wait, but wait: cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. Each of them is at every other position. So maybe it doesn't have any adjacent hydrogens that can shift because the carbons next to a carbonyl are either another carbonyl or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it can form a conjugated enol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about tautomerism: it occurs when a hydrogen and a lone pair can shift between adjacent atoms. So, in a diketone, like cyclohexane-1,2-dione, the hydrogen on the central carbon (if any) can shift, but wait, in that case, the cyclohexane-1,2-dione would have two adjacent carbonyls. But in
