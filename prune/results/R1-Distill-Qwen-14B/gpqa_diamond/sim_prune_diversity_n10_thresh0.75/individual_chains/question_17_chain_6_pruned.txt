Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. They give me that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means a more stable complex, right?

So the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, but what does that 0.02 M represent? Is it the concentration of the complex itself, or the total concentration of Ca and EDTA?

I think that when they say the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, it refers to the concentration of the complex, which is [CaY]^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

EDTA in solution exists in various protonated forms, but the problem states that the pH is ideal. I think that means the pH is such that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the one that complexes with Ca^2+. So I don’t have to worry about other forms of EDTA. That simplifies things.

The formation constant, K, for the reaction:
Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
is given as 5x10^10. Wait, no, the formation constant is often written as Kf, which is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

So the reaction is:
Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-; Kf = 5e10.

Wait, but in solution, the Ca-EDTA complex is present, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Now, the question is, what is [Ca^2+]?
