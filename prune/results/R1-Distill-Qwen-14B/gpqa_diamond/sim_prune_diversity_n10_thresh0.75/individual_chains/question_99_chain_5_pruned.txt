Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct structure of an unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the question gives me FTIR and 1H NMR data. I'll start by analyzing each.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids or maybe alcohols. But since there's another strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have both an O-H and a C=O group. So that fits. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, the 1H NMR data. It says that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds or triple bonds (like in alkenes or alkynes) in the structure. All the hydrogens are probably in single bonds. That means the molecule is saturated, no unsaturation.

Looking at the signals in the NMR: one is a doublet of triplet of quartets, another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think. Splitting patterns in NMR come from neighboring protons. So each splitting indicates how many neighboring H's are there.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the splitting terms. A doublet means split into two, which would be from one neighboring set. A triplet is from two adjacent Hs, with two neighbors. So a doublet of triplets would imply that a proton is split first by one set (making a doublet), and then each of those is further split by another set (making triplets). So the overall pattern is doublet of triplets, which would result in 2 * 3 = 6 peaks? Or maybe it's about the order of splitting.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of neighboring groups. For example, a doublet of triplets: that would be each peak in the doublet split into triplets. So each of the two peaks from the doublet would split into three, leading to 6 lines? Or maybe the splitting is sequential. Let me think of an example. Suppose the proton is next to two different sets of Hs. First, it's split by one set (say, 2 Hs) into a triplet. Then each of those is split again by another set (say, 1 H), making each line a doublet. So overall, a triplet of doublets, but the way it's described is doublet of triplet, which might be the same as a triplet of doublets in terms of the number of peaks but different in the order of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex. Let me think about the structures given in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Let me parse that structure. So the central part is C(H)(C
