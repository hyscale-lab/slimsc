Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic NMR, but let me think through it. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 10, H is 14. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation: that could be one ring (benzene) and three double bonds, but no, wait, wait. No, a benzene ring is three double bonds (so three degrees), and the fourth would be another ring or a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring (three) and one more double bond, but the molecular formula doesn't have a double bond. Or another ring? Wait, another ring would require more carbons, but our formula is C10H14. Oh, wait: benzene is C6H6. So the substituents add four carbons and eight hydrogens. Because 6+4=10, and 6 +8=14? Wait, wait: Wait, 6 (benzene) + substituent carbons =10 â†’ substituent carbons are 4. Hydrogens: benzene has 6, substituent adds 8 (since 6 +8=14?), but substituents could be alkyl groups.

Wait, maybe each substituent is a methyl group. Because, four substituents (each -CH3) would add 4 carbons and 4*(3)=12 hydrogens, but benzene already has 6 hydrogens. So 6 +12=18, but the molecular formula is C10H14. So that
