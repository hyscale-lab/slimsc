Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about brominating six different benzene derivatives and determining the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each listing a different order.

Wait, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. Also, steric effects might play a role when substituents are bulky.

Looking at the compounds:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So, bromine should add in the para position more than others.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The ester group is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Because esters are electron-withdrawing by the carbonyl group but the oxygen is still ortho/para-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Wait, but isn't Cl slightly deactivating but ortho/para-directing? Because it's an electron-withdrawing group but has lone pairs that can donate, making it an activating group in some cases. No, wait—Cl is a deactivating meta director? No, wait. No, Cl has an electronegative effect (deactivating) but is ortho/para-directing due to resonance. So, Cl is a meta director? Wait, no. Chlorine is ortho/para-directing. Because in the case of nitration, Cl is ortho, para.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2, COOH) are meta directors. Electron-donating groups (like OMe, NH2) are ortho/para. Cl is an exception—it's deactivating but ortho/para directing because of resonance. So in this case, Cl would direct the incoming Br to para and ortho positions.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, the incoming electrophile would go to the meta position. But wait, nitro is a meta director, so when nitro is present, the substitution occurs at meta positions more than para and ortho.

Wait, but in this reaction, it's electrophilic substitution. So, the substituent effect would determine where the Br adds.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. Similar to toluene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So, the Br would add to para and ortho positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing substituent. So,
