Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. They're heated to 200°C without air, and only a mixture of gases is formed. Then these gases are passed through several tubes, and based on the weight gains and losses, we need to figure out the total number of atoms in salts A and B.

Alright, let's start by summarizing the given information:

1. The mixture is equimolar, so moles of A equals moles of B.
2. The total mass is 7.20 grams.
3. The gases pass through three tubes:
   - Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. It's a drying agent, I think. Maybe it absorbs water?
   - Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. This is probably to absorb CO2 because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water.
   - Tube №3: Red-hot copper. This would react with certain gases. For example, CO would react to form CuO and CO2. Also, H2 might react with copper, but I'm not sure about the conditions here.

The results:
- Tube 1 gains 3.60g. Since it's Mg(ClO4)2, which is a desiccant, maybe it absorbed water. So the mass gained is water? So 3.60g of H2O.
- Tube 2 shows no change. So no CO2 was absorbed there, meaning maybe the gas didn't have CO2, or perhaps CO2 was present but didn't react? Wait, but if tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, any CO2 would form a precipitate. But the weight didn't change, which suggests no CO2 was present. So the gas mixture doesn't contain CO2. Or perhaps it's some other reason.
- Tube 3 gains 0.80g. The reaction here is probably CO reacting with Cu. Let me think, the reaction for CO and Cu is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So when CO passes through red-hot copper, it's oxidized to CO2. The mass gain in tube 3 would be the mass of CuO formed. Let me calculate that.

So, the mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80g of CuO. Let's find the moles of CuO. The molar mass of CuO is 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. So moles = 0.80 / 79.55 ≈ 0.01005 moles. So approximately 0.01 moles of CuO.

In the reaction, for every 2 moles of CO, we get 1 mole of CuO. So moles of CO would be 2 * 0.01005 ≈ 0.0201 moles.

So CO is present in the gas mixture, and it's 0.0201 moles.

Wait, but the problem says that after all these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles, because 22.4 L/mole * 0.1 = 2.24 L.

So gas C is 0.1 moles. Let's think about what could it be. Since tube 2 didn't react, it's not CO2. But in tube 3, some of the CO was converted to CO2. So what's left?

Wait, the initial gas mixture passed through tube 1 (which absorbs water) and then tube 2 (which absorbs CO2), but tube 2 didn't change. So the initial gases after tube 1 are CO and H2, perhaps? Because if tube 2 didn
