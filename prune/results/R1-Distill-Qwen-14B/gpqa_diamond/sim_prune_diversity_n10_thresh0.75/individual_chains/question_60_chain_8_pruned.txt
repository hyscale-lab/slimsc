Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and they want to reach Earth. The question is, from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take? And the options are whether the astronaut dies before reaching, or it takes about 72, 77, or 81 years.

Wait, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, from the perspective of someone on the spacecraft (the astronaut), the time experienced is different from the time observed from Earth.

Let me think about the concepts. There's proper time and coordinate time. Proper time is the time measured by the clock that's moving along with the astronaut. Coordinate time is the time measured in the stationary frame, which in this case would be Earth's frame.

But wait, the question is asking for the astronaut's experienced time, so that's the proper time. So we need to calculate the proper time for the trip from the astronaut's perspective.

But first, I need to know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure of the exact distance, but I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's see, so maybe about 163,000 light-years. Wait, I should check that. I think it's approximately 160,000 light-years. So let's say the distance is roughly 1.6e5 light-years.

The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's super close to the speed of light. So the time taken from Earth's perspective (coordinate time) would be distance divided by speed. Let me compute that.

Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time in Earth's frame is (163,000 ly) /
