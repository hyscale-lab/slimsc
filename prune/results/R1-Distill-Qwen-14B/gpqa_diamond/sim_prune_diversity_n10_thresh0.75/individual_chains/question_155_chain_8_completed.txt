Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Alright, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Oh wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make things a bit easier because then when I calculate ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Wait, but actually, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. But the state is given explicitly, so maybe I don't need to worry about that part beyond knowing that it's an eigenstate of P_x.

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is a vector in the P_z basis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z. Looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal. Let me write down the matrix:

P_z is a 3x3 matrix with elements:
First row: [ℏ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ℏ]

So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the diagonal elements. The state vector is (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the components are the coefficients in the eigenbasis.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ would be the sum of each component squared multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Let me calculate it step by step:

Each component squared:
|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

Multiply each by their eigenvalues:
(1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4 - ℏ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just the square of its eigenvalues because it's diagonal. So the eigenvalues of P_z squared are (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, which are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the squared eigenvalues:

(1/4)*(ℏ²) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(ℏ²) = (ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/2.

So now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ℏ²/2 - 0) = sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ℏ/sqrt(2), which matches this result.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$), and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $\psi$ are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the results:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:
