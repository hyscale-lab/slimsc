Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Right, the question states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So the first thing I remember is that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical addition. I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because at high speeds, velocities don't add linearly.

So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/c²). Let me write that down. So v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)).

But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²) / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c, which is 1/7 c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Oh wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So I need to compute gamma for each mass and add them together.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².
