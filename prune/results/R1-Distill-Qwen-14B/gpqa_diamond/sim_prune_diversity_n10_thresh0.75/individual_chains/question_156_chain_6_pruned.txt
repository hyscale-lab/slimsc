Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically occurs via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. Wait, but wait, I think when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions are important. Oh, right, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide, and that's an oxidation reaction.

Wait, but wait. The reaction also includes aqueous acid after the mCPBA treatment. Oh, right, I think that's the work-up. So the epoxide is formed, and then maybe further reactions happen. Wait, no, wait. Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. So mCPBA adds the epoxide, and then in the presence of aqueous acid, the epoxide might open.

Wait, so in the first reaction, we have (E)-oct-4-ene. Treating with mCPBA would form an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide would depend on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E) alkenes, the substituents are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. Then, under acidic conditions, the epoxide would protonate and open. How does that work?

Wait, when an epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens via a protonation leading to a carbocation, followed by nucleophilic attack. The nucleophile could be water or another nucleophile. Since it's aqueous acid, probably water is the nucleophile.

But wait, let's think about the reaction steps. For (E)-oct-4-ene, adding mCPBA forms an epoxide. Let me draw it. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, but wait, oct-4-ene
