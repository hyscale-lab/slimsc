Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll go step by step.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, does that mean it's a 3x1 vector? Because the operators P and Q are 3x3 matrices. So yeah, the state vector is in a 3-dimensional space.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. Let me write them down to visualize better.

Operator P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measured in that order. So first measure P, then Q.

Wait, but I remember that in quantum mechanics, measurements affect the state. So measuring P first will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: measuring Q just after P. So yes, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Then measure P, get 0, then measure Q on that resulting state.

Wait, but I need to find the probability of both events happening: getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability that when you measure P, you get 0, and then when you measure Q on the same state (post-measurement of P), you get -1.

So the approach would be:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Because measuring P and getting 0 would collapse the state into that eigenvector.
3. Then, express the initial state |ψ> in terms of the eigenbasis of P. The coefficient corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue will give the amplitude, and the square of its magnitude is the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.
4. Then, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q on the same state after collapse.

Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Since the initial state is given, and the operators are known, maybe I can compute the probabilities directly without diagonalizing P.

Wait, but perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues of P because I need to find the eigenvalue 0. Let me see.

Operator P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write the matrix P - λI:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

Calculating the determinant:

| -λ        1/√2         0      |
| 1/√2     -λ          1/√2   |
| 0        1/√2       -λ      |

The determinant can be found using cofactor expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the matrix has any obvious eigenvectors.

Looking at the first row: any vectors where the second component is 0 might be candidates?

Wait, perhaps I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me think about symmetric matrices. P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable.

The trace of P is 0, since the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So sum of eigenvalues is 0. The determinant would be the product of the eigenvalues.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for eigenvectors.

Suppose λ=0:

Then P - 0I = P.

Looking for a vector v = (a, b, c) such that Pv = 0.

So:

Row 1: (0*a) + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 → b=0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 → a + c = 0.

Row 3: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2)) b + 0*c = 0 → which is redundant because b=0.

So from a + c = 0 and b=0, we have a = -c.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (a, 0, -a) = a (1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1, 0, -1). Let's normalize it.

The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to this eigenvector.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let's write it as a vector:

|ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

We need to find the projection of |ψ> onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

The projection amplitude is the inner product of |ψ> and the eigenvector.

Eigenvector v = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So inner product:

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1
= (-1)/(sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2))
= (-2)/(sqrt(2)) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, that's the amplitude. The probability is the square of the magnitude of this amplitude.

So |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But wait, probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the inner product.

v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

ψ is (-1, 2, 1).

So:

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1)
= (-1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + (-1)/sqrt(2)
= (-2)/sqrt(2) = (-sqrt(2)).

Wait, because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), but since it's negative, it's -sqrt(2). So the magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have messed up the normalization.

Wait a second, the eigenvector v is (1, 0, -1), but when normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So when I compute the inner product, it's (1/sqrt(2))* (-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1).

Which is (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414. So the inner product is -1.414. But the inner product's magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. Which can't be correct because the probability can't be more than 1.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Let me check the eigenvectors again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving for the eigenvectors when λ=0. Let me re-calculate that.

When λ=0, the equations are:

1. (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → b=0.
2. (1/sqrt(2)) a + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 → a + c = 0.
3. (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → same as equation 1.

So, a = -c. So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So any vector where the second component is zero and the first is negative the third.

So the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1), which has a norm squared of 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So when normalized, each component is divided by sqrt(2). So yes, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is correct, but the probability can't be 2. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the inner product again.

v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) + 0 * 2 + (-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2), so the probability is |amplitude|^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2? That's impossible because probabilities can't be more than 1. So I must have messed up the state normalization.

Wait, the initial state |ψ> is given as (-1, 2, 1). Is it normalized? Let's check its norm.

||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So |ψ> is not normalized. So to get the actual state vector, we need to normalize it by dividing by sqrt(6).

So |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

Ah, this is a critical point I missed. So the state given is not normalized, so I must normalize it before doing any calculations.

So the correct initial state is ( [-1, 2, 1] ) / sqrt(6).

So when I compute the inner product with the eigenvector of P, I have to use this normalized state.

Let me recompute the inner product.

v is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

ψ_normalized is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

So inner product:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) ]

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so:

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v. So the new state is |v> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, we need to measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix:

Q = diag(1, 0, -1).

So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So if the state is |v> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)), let's express this in terms of the eigenbasis of Q.

Expressed as a vector, |v> is:

(1/sqrt(2)) |e1> + 0 |e2> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |e3>

So when measuring Q on |v>, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients in front of each eigenstate.

So for outcome 1: coefficient is 1/sqrt(2), probability (1/2).

For outcome 0: coefficient is 0, probability 0.

For outcome -1: coefficient is (-1)/sqrt(2), probability (1/2).

So the probability of measuring -1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the joint probability of first getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

So the joint probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0.

Which is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, no. Because after measuring P=0, the state is |v>, and in that state, the probability to get Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The state after measuring P=0 is |v>, which is the eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. So when I measure Q on this state, the probabilities are as I computed.

So the joint probability is 1/3 (from P) multiplied by 1/2 (from Q), giving 1/6.

So the answer should be 1/6, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the Q measurement.

Wait, the state |v> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). So when measuring Q, which is diag(1,0,-1), the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The projection onto each eigenvector is:

For eigenvalue 1: the first basis vector |e1>. The component in |e1> is (1/sqrt(2)) * 1, so the coefficient is 1/sqrt(2). The probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

For eigenvalue 0: the second basis vector |e2>. The component is 0, so probability 0.

For eigenvalue -1: the third basis vector |e3>. The component is (-1/sqrt(2)), so probability (1/2).

So yes, the probability of measuring -1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. So the answer is D) 1/6.


The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Initial State Normalization**:  
   The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:  
   \[
   \| | \psi \rangle \|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{6}.
   \]  
   The normalized state is:  
   \[
   | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector of \( P \)**:  
   The operator \( P \) is given by:  
   \[
   P = \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), we find that \( \lambda = 0 \) corresponds to the eigenvector:  
   \[
   v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared magnitude of the projection of \( | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \) onto the eigenvector \( v \):  
   \[
   \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]  
   The probability is:  
   \[
   P(P = 0) = \left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

4. **State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   Upon measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to the eigenvector \( v \):  
   \[
   | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

5. **Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)**:  
   The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:  
   \[
   Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -1 
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( | e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( | e_2 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( | e_3 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).  
   The state \( | v \rangle \) can be expressed as:  
   \[
   | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} | e_1 \rangle + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} | e_3 \rangle.
   \]  
   The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared magnitude of the coefficient of \( | e_3 \rangle \):  
   \[
   P(Q = -1) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

6. **Joint Probability**:  
   The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:  
   \[
   P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
