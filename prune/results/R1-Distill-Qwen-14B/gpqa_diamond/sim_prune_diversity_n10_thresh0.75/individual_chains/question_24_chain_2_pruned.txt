Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it looks a bit tricky. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds because alkenes can react with bromine in a process called addition. So mixture X probably contains alkenes or maybe something else with unsaturation.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so Y doesn't have any double bonds? Or maybe they're in a different form that doesn't react with bromine. Oh, but wait, the reaction with platinum under heat—what kind of reaction is that? Oh, right, hydrogenation. Platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, which adds hydrogen across double bonds. So maybe X has alkenes that are getting hydrogenated to alkanes, which don't have double bonds. But wait, the problem says that when mixture X is hydrogenated, it gives hydrocarbon Z. Wait, no—mixture Y is formed via hydrogenation, and then when both X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z.

Wait, the problem says that treating X with Pt when heated gives Y, which is a result of a disproportionation. Oh wait, no, the problem says "disproportionation" for the formation of Y. Disproportionation is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. Hmm, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, wait, maybe each component undergoes a reaction. Or perhaps the two components in X react with each other in some way when hydrogenated. Wait, no, the reaction is with Pt and heat, which is hydrogenation. So perhaps each component in X is hydrogenated. But how does that lead to a mixture Y which is the result of a disproportionation?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's take it step by step.

So, X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So each of the two components has a double bond because that's what reacts with bromine water.

Then when X is treated with Pt and heated,
