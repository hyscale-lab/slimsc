Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for Co(SCN)2^+, maybe? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The general form for a complex is Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}, I think. Because Co^2+ and each SCN- is -1, so for n SCN- ions, the charge would be 2+ - n*(1-) = 2-n.

So the complexes are:
- Co^2+ (n=0)
- Co(SCN)^+ (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2 (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^- (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^{2-} (n=4)

Each stability constant βn is for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN)^+, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants are usually for the formation of the complex. So the general equation is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n^{2-n} ; βn = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n)

So βn increases with more SCN- added, but in this case, the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, β3 is the highest here. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions, Co(SCN)_3^-.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions. So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which is the second complex with β2=40. So the question is asking about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 in the solution.

Our goal is to find the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 among all cobalt species. So all species include Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3^-, and Co(SCN)_4^{2-}.

To find the percentage, I think we can model this using the formation of each complex step by step and calculate their concentrations based on the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But wait, the SCN-
