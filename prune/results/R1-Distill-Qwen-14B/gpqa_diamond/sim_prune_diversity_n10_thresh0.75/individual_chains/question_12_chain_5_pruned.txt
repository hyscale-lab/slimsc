Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, it's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Let me think about how to approach this.

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. So the equation is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. I remember that when a particle is at rest and decays, we have to consider conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny masses, almost negligible. I think in these cases, we treat them as massless, which simplifies things.

So the rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu is 105.7 MeV/c². Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, we can ignore it for this calculation. 

Wait, but wait. The problem is the KE of the product particles. So the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino are the products.

Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just |p_nu|c, right? Because for massless particles, E = pc.

Hmm, but wait, the muon has mass, so its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). So let's set up the equations.

The total energy before decay is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy.

So,

E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

And for momentum,

p_mu = p_nu (since they're opposite, but since neutrino is moving opposite, their magnitudes are the same, but directions are opposite. So when summing, they cancel out.)

But for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c. And for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

But because p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. So,

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 )

E_nu = p c.

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Hmm, that equation looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root, but that might get messy. Alternatively, I can let x = p c, then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Let me write it as sqrt(x² + a²) + x = b, where
