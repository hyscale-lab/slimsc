Okay, so I need to figure out the product of a Cope rearrangement starting from (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Cope rearrangement, but I remember it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. Let's try to break this down.

First, I should draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, which means it's a norbornene structure. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) on carbon 2 and an azabicyclo group. Wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo system has three bridgehead carbons. The numbering is a bit tricky, but I think the bridgehead positions are 1, 4, and 5, maybe?

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has two two-carbon bridges and one one-carbon bridge. So the structure would have bridges between 1-4, 4-5, and 5-1? Or something like that. The structure is a bit complicated, but perhaps I can visualize it as a norbornene with a substituent.

The starting molecule has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) attached to the same carbon where the nitrogen is. So it's 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. Wait, no, the bicyclo is the base structure. So the 2-position is one of the bridgehead carbons? Or is it a substituent on the bridge?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's see: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bridge is between carbons 1, 4, and 5. So the structure has a bridge from C1 to C4 (length 2), another from C4 to C5 (length 2), and another from C5 back to C1 (length 1). The double bond is between C5 and C6, perhaps? Or maybe between C5 and another carbon.

Wait, maybe the numbering
