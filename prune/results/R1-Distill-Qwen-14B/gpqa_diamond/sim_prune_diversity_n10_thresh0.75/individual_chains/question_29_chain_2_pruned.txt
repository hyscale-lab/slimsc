Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and four mutant sequences are provided. I need to find out which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, thus stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant is a variant of the original gene. So, I should compare each mutant's sequence to the original to see where the changes are and what kind of changes they are.

First, the intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. Let me write that down.

Now, let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm, comparing to the intact gene. Let's see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …TGA

Wait, let's line them up:

Original:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA

Mutant1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...TGA

Looking for differences:

- The second codon in the original is TTT (Phe), in mutant1 it's TTC (also Phe). So same amino acid. No change here.

Wait, wait, that can't be. Let me look again. Oh wait, wait no.

Wait, original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each segment.

Original: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, so let's compare each part.

Original first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first few codons:
