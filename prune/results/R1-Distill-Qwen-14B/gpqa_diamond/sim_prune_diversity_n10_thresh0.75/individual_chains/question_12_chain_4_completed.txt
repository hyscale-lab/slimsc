Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a Pi(+) particle is at rest and decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. They gave me the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, right. So the pion is at rest, so its momentum is zero. When it decays, the total momentum of the products must be zero too, because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions opposite.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. I think neutrinos have very tiny mass, but in many cases, like in beta decay, they are considered massless. But wait, I remember that in cases like pion decay, the neutrino might be a muon neutrino, and there are discussions about its mass, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can assume it's massless? Because the muon is much more massive.

Wait, the pion is at rest, so the total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino share this energy. But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So let's think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the four-momentum. The pion is at rest, so its four-momentum is (E, 0), where E is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the muon and neutrino have four-momenta (E1, p1) and (E2, p2). Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before is zero, so p1 + p2 = 0. So p2 = -p1, meaning their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

But the neutrino's mass is negligible, so for it, E2 = |p2| c, but since we're working in units where c=1, E2 = |p2|.

The muon has mass, so its energy is sqrt( (p1 c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Wait, but in units where c=1, it's sqrt( p1² + m_mu² ).

So let's write the energy conservation equation: E1 + E2 = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

But E2 is |p2|, which is the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum. Since p1 and p2 are equal in magnitude, E2 = p1.

So E1 = sqrt( p1² + m_mu² ), and E2 = p1.

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( p1² + (105.7)^2 ) + p1 = 139.6

Hmm, let me let x = p1 for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Subtract x from both sides: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So,

x² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 x

Compute the squares:

105.7 squared is approximately (100 +5.7)^2. Let me calculate:

105.7^2 = (100)^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

Wait, but 105.7 * 105.7: Let me compute it accurately. 100 *100 is 10,000. 100*5.7=570, 5.7*100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49. So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab +b². So 105.7² = 11172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me compute 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So putting the numbers back:

11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x

Rearranging:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Let me compute 19488.16 - 11172.49.

19488.16 minus 11172. Let's see:

19488.16 -11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49). 19488-11172=8316. 0.16-0.49= -0.33. So 8316 -0.33=8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈ let's see.

2.792 * 30 = 83.76 → which is slightly larger than 83.1567. So about 29.8 or so?

Wait, 2.792 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 2.792 * 30 = 83.76. Subtract 2.792 * 0.2 = 0.5584 → 83.76 -0.5584=83.2016. Hmm, which is just a bit above 83.1567.

Wait, wait, so 2.792 * 29.8 = 83.2016. But our numerator is 83.1567, which is less. So perhaps 29.8 minus a little.

The difference between 83.2016 and 83.1567 is about 0.0449. Since each 0.1 is 0.2792 in the product. So 0.0449 / 2.792 ≈ 0.016.

So approximately 29.8 - 0.016 = 29.784. So x≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, that's the neutrino's energy, E2, which equals x. Because E2 = p1 = x.

Wait no, E2 is the neutrino's energy, which is equal to p1 (because for a massless particle, E = |p|). So E2 = x ≈29.784 MeV.

Then, the muon's energy, E1, is sqrt(x² + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784^2: approx (30)^2=900, but 29.784 is 0.216 less than 30. So (30 - 0.216)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 → 900 -12.96 + 0.046656 → 887.086656.

And 105.7^2 = 11172.49 as before.

So E1 = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576656) → sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.815 MeV.

Wait, let me compute 109.8^2: 109^2 is 11881, 0.8^2 is 0.64, and cross term 2*109*0.8=174.4 → 11881 + 174.4 +0.64=12056.04. Hmm, our value is 12059.57, which is a bit higher than 109.8^2. So 109.815^2 is about 12059.57, so E1≈109.815 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. E1 + E2 = 109.815 +29.784 ≈139.6 MeV. That checks out.

So the muon's energy is about 109.8 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV.

But wait, the question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Ah right, because the rest energy is part of the total energy. So kinetic energy is (total energy) minus (rest energy).

For the muon: KE_mu = E1 - m_mu c² = 109.815 - 105.7 ≈4.115 MeV.

For the neutrino: KE_nu = E2 - m_nu c². But m_nu is negligible, so KE_nu ≈ E2 =29.8 MeV.

Wait, but in reality, the neutrino does have some mass, but it's extremely small. For most practical purposes, especially in problems like this, we can treat it as zero. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy.

So the KEs are approximately 4.115 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, which option has these numbers.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV

C)3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV

D)4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV

So option D matches. So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson into a μ⁺ and a neutrino (ν). The reaction is:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of the π⁺ meson: \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the μ⁺ lepton: \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\( m_\nu \approx 0 \)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before and after the decay is conserved.
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu
   \]
   Since the π⁺ is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total momentum before and after the decay is conserved. Since the π⁺ is at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero:
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_\nu = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_\nu|.
   \]

### Energy of the μ⁺:
The total energy of the μ⁺ is given by:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino:
For a massless neutrino, the total energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}.
\]

### Solving for \( p_{\mu^+} \):
Using energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}.
\]
Let \( x = p_{\mu^+} \). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - x)^2 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]
Cancel \( x^2 \) and rearrange:
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \implies x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Total Energy of the μ⁺:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{(29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
Compute:
\[
(29.784)^2 \approx 887.09, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.815 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the μ⁺:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.815 - 105.7 \approx 4.115 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino:
The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = p_\nu = x \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( 2.84 \, \text{MeV}, 26.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **B)** \( 7.2 \, \text{MeV}, 32.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **C)** \( 3.52 \, \text{MeV}, 20.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Incorrect.
- **D)** \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) — Correct.
