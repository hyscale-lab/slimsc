Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given here: L = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. 

First, I need to determine the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because in four-dimensional spacetime, the action (which is the integral of the Lagrangian) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

Let me break down the terms in the interaction Lagrangian. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

I know that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2. 

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they are just matrices, no mass scaling), σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well. So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because σ is dimensionless, so 3 comes from the two ψ terms.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism (I assume, since F is antisymmetric and comes from a gauge field A). The field strength F has the same dimension as the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the field tensor F is made from derivatives of A, and derivatives have dimension 1. So F has dimension 2. 

Wait, let me think again: the field strength tensor F^{μν} is ∂μ A^ν - ∂ν A^μ. Each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂μ A^ν which is dimension 2. So F has dimension 2. 

Putting this together, the term ψ̄ σ ψ F would have dimensions from each part. The ψ̄ σ ψ part is dimension 3, and F is dimension 2. So the whole term is 3 + 2 = 5. 

But wait, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so the coupling κ must adjust this. So the term κ * (term) must have dimension 4. The (term) has dimension 5, so κ must have dimension -1 to bring the total to 4. So [κ]_M is -1. 

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 (I think). Wait, no, actually, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because in the renormalization process, the divergences are handled by counterterms which must have the same form as terms in the original Lagrangian. 

Wait, no, actually, the condition is that the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4 minus the sum of the fields' dimensions in the term. Or wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the superficial degree of divergence. 

Another approach: In four dimensions, a term with dimension D contributes to a Feynman diagram with a superficial degree of divergence D - 4L, where L is the number of loops. But for renormalizability, all terms must have D ≤4. Because if any term has D>4, then the theory is nonrenormalizable. 

Wait, wait, in the interaction Lagrangian, each term must have mass dimension ≤4 for the theory to be renormalizable. So let's check our term. The interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. What's the dimension of this term?

Wait, I calculated earlier that each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So let me compute:

The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ * ψ * F. 

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. F is 2. So the product is 3 + 2 =5. So κ has to make the term dimension 4, so κ is 4 -5 = -1. So the dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the interaction term has dimension 4 (since κ is -1, and the rest is 5, so 5 + (-1) =4). So the Lagrangian term is renormalizable if the term itself has dimension ≤4. Since it's exactly 4, this is a renormalizable interaction.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the dimension of the Lagrangian term must be 4, which is okay. But what about the number of fields? Because for renormalizability, you also need that the term doesn't have more fields than the dimension allows. But in this case, the term is a four-dimensional term. So the theory should be renormalizable. 

Wait, but wait a second. The term is quartic in fields? Let me count the fields. ψ̄ is one field, ψ is another, and F is two fields? Wait, no, F is derived from two A fields (since F is ∂A). But in terms of field components, F is a field in itself, so the term has four fields: ψ̄, ψ, and F (which has two field components because F_{μν} is a tensor). Hmm, this might be getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Another approach is to consider the scaling dimension. For a term to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, it's like having a higher-order term (since the dimension is negative, more like 1/(mass)^n). 

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling κ is [κ] = -1. So the term is dimension 4 because [κ] + [ψ̄ψ F] = (-1) + (3+2) =4. But since [κ] is negative, that implies that the theory has an interaction term that is dimension 4. Wait, but wait: the condition for renormalizability is that the coupling has dimension ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has negative dimension, it would imply that the interaction is relevant (like a dimensionless coupling in 4D), but wait, actually, in 4D, dimensionless couplings are renormalizable. Wait, no, in 4D, a coupling is renormalizable if its dimension is ≥0, because higher dimensions would mean more severe UV divergences.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

In a general spacetime dimension d, a theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling [g] satisfies [g] ≥ (d - (sum of fields' dimensions)). But I'm not exactly recalling the formula correctly. 

Another approach: Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤ d, where d is 4 for our case. Because if a term has higher dimension, it's nonrenormalizable. So in this case, the term is dimension 4, which is okay. So the theory is renormalizable.

Wait wait wait, but no, because the term has dimension 4, which is the maximum allowed for renormalizability. So the theory is renormalizable.

But wait, let me think about the number of derivatives. The interaction term has F^{μν}, which contains two derivatives. So the term is something like (∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ) which is two derivatives. So the term is of order (∂^2), which in terms of mass dimension is 2. But the term as a whole must have dimension 4. 

Wait, perhaps another way: the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's compute the dimension of each part. 

ψ̄ (dimension 3/2)
σ_{μν} (dimension 0)
ψ (dimension 3/2)
F (dimension 2)

So adding those: 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So the product without κ is dimension 5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the entire term dimension 4. 

So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. 

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. Now, for renormalizability, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. Since our term is exactly 4, the theory is renormalizable. 

Wait, wait, but wait. Another thought: In four dimensions, renormalizable theories have terms with dimension <=4. Since this term is dimension 4, it's renormalizable. So the answer would be that κ has dimension -1 and the theory is renormalizable. 

Looking at the options, option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable. Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. So I think the correct answer is A.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four-dimensional spacetime, as the action (the integral of the Lagrangian) is dimensionless.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ for electromagnetism has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$, as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$ (which has $[A]_M = 1$).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4. Breaking it down:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.
- $[F]_M = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless since it is a commutator of $\gamma$ matrices, which are dimensionless.
- Thus, the total dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is $3 + 2 = 5$.

To ensure the Lagrangian term has dimension 4, $\kappa$ must have dimension $[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension $\leq 4$. The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension 4, which satisfies the condition for renormalizability. Therefore, the theory is renormalizable.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. This is correct.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. Incorrect, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. Incorrect, as the theory is renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. Incorrect, as $[\kappa]_M = -1$ and the theory is renormalizable.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is renormalizable.
