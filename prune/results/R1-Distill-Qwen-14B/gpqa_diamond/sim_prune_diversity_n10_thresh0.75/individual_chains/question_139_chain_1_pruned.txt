Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about two compounds, A and B, reacting with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, producing different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

First, I remember that when alcohols are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's a common way to form ketones through the Stephen reduction or maybe some kind of elimination-addition reaction. Wait, no, Stephen reduction is more about converting ketones to alcohols. Oh wait, maybe it's the Jones oxidation or something else. Or wait, waitâ€”sodium nitrite and HCl conditions. Hmm. Oh right! I think this is the preparation of a carbonyl group from an alcohol using the hydroxylamine method? No, that's for forming amides. Wait, maybe it's the reaction where an alcohol is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. But how?

Wait, I'm confusing things. Let me think again. Oh! I think the reaction here is the production of a diketone from a diol. Because when you have a diol (a molecule with two adjacent hydroxyl groups), and you treat it with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it can undergo a cyclization or elimination to form a diketone. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxidation of a
