Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a specific value for an observable. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space, right? So I think this means it's a 3-dimensional vector. But I should check if it's normalized. Because probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector.

Wait, the state vector needs to have a norm of 1. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. Let me calculate that. So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, right, so the state vector isn't normalized. That complicates things a bit. But wait, in quantum mechanics, we usually work with normalized vectors, so I think I need to normalize it. But wait, the problem doesn't say anything about it. Hmm, maybe I should proceed assuming it's normalized, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, the observable is given by matrix P, and the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So perhaps the approach is to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and see the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.

Wait, but first, what's the observable P? The matrix P is given:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the observable's possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. So the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. Then, when the problem asks for the probability of getting 0, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and compute the projection.

So, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) =0.

But wait, maybe I can find the eigenvalues without getting into heavy calculations. Looking at the matrix, perhaps it's symmetric, which would mean it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, which is good.

Let me compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So 0 +0 +0 =0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is 0, since trace equals sum of eigenvalues.

Also, the determinant of P? Hmm, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues another way. Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator? Wait, no, because the rows don't sum to 1 or 0. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by noting the structure.

Looking at the matrix, it's a symmetric matrix with a certain pattern. Let me consider the eigenvectors. For a matrix like this, maybe there's an eigenvector that's symmetric or antisymmetric in some way.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues directly.

So the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write out P - λ I:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant is:

| -λ    1/√2    0    |
|1/√2  -λ   1/√2 |  = 0
| 0    1/√2  -λ   |

To compute this determinant, I can expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ] ] ) - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] ) + 0 * something.

So computing each minor:

First term: -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ ( λ² - (1/2) )

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = - (1/√2) * ( - λ /√2 ) = (λ)/2

Third term is 0.

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0

Expand the first product:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) ) + (λ/2) = 0

Combine like terms:

-λ^3 + (λ/2 + λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ = 0

Factor out λ:

λ (-λ² +1 ) =0

So eigenvalues: λ=0, and solutions to -λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0 is the subspace of states that would be measured as 0.

So I need to find the eigenvectors for λ=0 and compute the projection of the given state onto this eigenspace.

But wait, the given state is a vector with components (-1, 2, 1). But earlier I thought it's not normalized. Let me confirm: the vector has squared norm 6. So the actual state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) times (-1, 2, 1). Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized.

Wait, but the problem statement says the state is the column matrix having those elements. So perhaps the state is not normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector for probabilities to make sense. Maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the observable is not Hermitian, but wait, no, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, so P must be Hermitian. Let me check P: the matrix is symmetric, so yes, it's Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real, as expected.

So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But it's not normalized. So I should normalize it for the calculation. Because the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|² where |v⟩ is the eigenvector, but I need |ψ⟩ to be a unit vector. So I should probably normalize it.

So first, compute the norm of |ψ⟩: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)= sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

But wait, the problem didn't mention normalizing. So perhaps I can proceed without it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to proceed with the given vector, but that would mean the probabilities are scaled by 1/6, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), and the observable is P. So the probability is the expectation of the projection onto the eigenspace of P with eigenvalue 0.

But to compute that, I need to find the eigenvectors of P for λ=0.

So let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We can set up (P - 0 I ) |v⟩ = 0 → P |v⟩ =0.

So the system of equations is:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3= -v1.

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as row 1, so v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are vectors where v2=0 and v3= -v1. So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T. So any vector in the direction (1, 0, -1). Because if v1=1, then v3=-1. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check. The equations are:

v2=0,

v1 + v3 =0,

and v2=0 again. So yes, the solutions are v1 = a, v2=0, v3= -a. So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1,0,-1).

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with basis vector (1,0,-1).

But wait, any scalar multiple, so perhaps normalized as (1/√2)(1,0,-1). Because the norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1 +0 +1) )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Now, to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, I need to find the squared magnitude of the projection of |ψ⟩ onto this eigenvector.

Wait, but wait. The state |ψ⟩ is given as (-1,2,1), but I'm assuming it's not normalized. So perhaps I should normalize |ψ⟩ first.

So |ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).

The eigenvector |v⟩ is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2).

Compute the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

⟨v| is [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).

So:

⟨v | ψ⟩ = [1/(sqrt(2)) ] * [ (-1)(1) + 2*(0) + 1*(-1) ) ] / sqrt(6) )

Wait, wait. Let me do it step by step.

⟨v| is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

|ψ⟩ is ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) * ( (-1)(1) + 0*(2) + (-1)(1) ) ) / sqrt(6).

Simplify numerator:

(-1) *1 + 0 + (-1)*1 = -1 +0 -1 = -2.

So the inner product is ( -2 ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(6) ) ) = (-2) / (sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

The probability is the squared magnitude, so (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

⟨v | ψ⟩ = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2) · [ -1, 2, 1 ]/sqrt(6 )

The dot product is (1*(-1) ) + (0 *2 ) + ( (-1)*1 ) ) = (-1) +0 + (-1 )= -2.

Then, multiply by 1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(6) ) → (-2)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3). The absolute value squared is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The observable P can have eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0. The eigenspace for 0 is one-dimensional. So the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the projection onto that eigenspace.

Wait, but perhaps I should also consider other eigenvectors. Because sometimes, the eigenspace could be multi-dimensional, but in this case, for λ=0, it's a single vector. So my calculation is correct.

So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0. The state of the system is given as the vector \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). Expanding the determinant:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = \begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

Expanding along the first row:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda \begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{vmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

The first minor is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The second minor is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= -\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Substituting back:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda (\lambda^2 - \frac{1}{2}) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(-\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda + \frac{\lambda}{2} = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring:

\[
\lambda (-\lambda^2 + 1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are:

\[
\lambda = 0, \, 1, \, -1.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvectors satisfy \( P | v \rangle = 0 \). Solving \( (P - 0I) | v \rangle = 0 \), we get the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0, \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

From the first and third equations, \( v_2 = 0 \). From the second equation, \( v_1 + v_3 = 0 \), so \( v_3 = -v_1 \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( | v \rangle = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \), where \( a \) is a scalar. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
| v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Normalizing the State \( | \psi \rangle \)
The given state \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto the Eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto the eigenspace of \( \lambda = 0 \). The projection is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Computing the dot product:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{6}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} (-2) = \frac{-2}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the squared magnitude:

\[
P(0) = \left| \langle v | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
