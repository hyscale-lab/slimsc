Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the mirror images of a compound are non-superimposable, right? So the compound must have chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry that allows for enantiomers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Also, the ester groups are from the carboxylate. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, like coplanar or trans. But for optical isomerism, the molecule needs to have a plane of symmetry or lack one. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is chiral, then it can have enantiomers. So the biphenyl here has substituents at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Let me visualize this: each benzene ring has two substituents, ester groups at 2 and 2', nitro at 6 and 6'. I think position 6 is the para position relative to 2. So if the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, then each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, 6 would be across from 2 on the benzene ring. But in a biphenyl, the substituents' positions affect the possibility of a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrically arranged, maybe the molecule is achiral. But if not, it could be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups and ester groups create a situation where the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. I'm a bit confused, but I think in this case, the molecule might have a center of asymmetry. Or maybe the biphenyl has substituents that create a chiral axis or something. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other
