Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology, specifically about a problem with a transgenic mouse model. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The researcher is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice. They've introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So the question is why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand. Let's think about possible issues. The options given are A to D. I'll go through each option to see which makes the most sense.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean that the HA tag isn't correctly formed, possibly leading to no protein or a truncated version. But if the HA tag is at the N-terminus, a mutation there might prevent proper folding or recognition by purification methods, but the construct's expression may still produce the protein, just not tag properly. But the issue here is overexpression isn't happening, not that it's not tagged correctly. So maybe not A.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That suggests a premature stop codon. The ribosome stops at stop codons, so if a stop codon is introduced early, the protein would be shorter. So looking at the DNA sequence, perhaps there's a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) in the coding region. Wait, the sequence given is the coding sequence, right? So I need to look for any in-frame stop codons.

Option C: The lack of a linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. A linker sequence could be part of the tag or maybe a protease cleavage site. Without a linker, maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized by proteases. But proteolysis usually occurs post-translation, so the protein would be present but degraded. The question says they can't overexpress, implying maybe the protein isn't made at all or is made but not detected. If it's degraded, perhaps western blot wouldn't detect it. But the problem is the expression issue, not detection. So maybe not.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But wait, the construct is in a plasmid, and when transfected into CHO cells. CHO cells are mammalian, so they use mammalian tRNA. So if the construct has a UAA codon, but the mouse (or CHO) tRNA for that doesn't exist, the ribosome would terminate early. But the issue is that the construct is expressed in CHO cells, not in the mouse yet. Wait, but the problem is that when they test the expression in the transfected cells, the protein isn't overexpressed. So if the construct has a premature stop codon (like UAA which is a stop codon), that would cause early termination.

Let me look at the DNA sequence provided. Let's see if there's a stop codon introduced.

The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence starts with the HA sequence followed by GADD45G. Let me look for stop codons in the coding region.

Looking at the sequence, perhaps I should scan for any TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets. Let me look through the sequence.

Looking for TGA: Let's see. The sequence starts ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTG GAA GAA GTC... Oh, wait, there's a TGA here. Wait, let me see:

Breaking it down:

Looking for any triplet that's TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the start: 5'AT
