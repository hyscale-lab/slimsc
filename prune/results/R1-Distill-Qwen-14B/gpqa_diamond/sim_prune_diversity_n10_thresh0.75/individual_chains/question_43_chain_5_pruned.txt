Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.

First, I remember that IUPAC naming for benzene rings involves numbering the substituents to give the lowest possible numbers. The substituents are arranged in order of priority. The functional groups in order of priority are: carboxylic acid (highest), then cyano, then aldehyde, then others like amino, hydroxyl, methoxy.

The question says there's a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group).

I think I should draw this structure. Let me imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon.

The carboxylic acid is one substituent. Let's say it's at position 1. Since the other groups (cyano, aldehyde) are meta to each other and to the carboxylic acid, I need to figure out their positions.

Wait, meta to each other means that each is separated by two carbons. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the aldehyde and cyano would be at positions 3 and 5, or 4 and 6? Wait, no. Because each of them is meta to each other.

Wait, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the other groups (cyano, aldehyde) are meta to each other and also meta to the acid? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In a benzene ring, meta positions are two positions away. So, if a group is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. So, if two substituents are meta to each other, they would be two apart. For example, if one is at 3, the other would be at 5.

Wait, but the question says the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. That would require each to be meta to the others, which is impossible
