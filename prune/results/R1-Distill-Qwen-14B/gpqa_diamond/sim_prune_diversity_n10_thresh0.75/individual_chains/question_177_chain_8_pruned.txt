Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies and want to compute the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I think I should recall what determines the luminosity of a star. Luminosity (L) is related to radius (R) and temperature (T) via the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, the key here is to find the temperatures of the two stars.

Wait, the question says the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. I remember that the peak wavelength (λ_max) of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Wait, but wait a second—no, no, wait. No, no, that's not right. Because if both have the same λ_max, then T would be the same. But wait, because star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Oh, right! Because the star is moving, there's a Doppler effect that affects the observed wavelength. So the actual emission peak might be different, but the observed peak is the same.

So, the peak wavelength we observe is different from the rest wavelength. So, for each star, their actual (rest) peak wavelengths would be different, but the observed peak is the same because of their velocities.

Wait, let me think. So, the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/ (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that, depending on whether the star is moving towards or away. Wait, no, that's the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But wait, maybe the velocities are high enough that we need to use the relativistic formula. Alternatively, if they're not too high, maybe the non-relativistic approximation is okay.

Wait, the radial velocity for Star_2 is 700 km/s. Let's see, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% the speed of light. Hmm. So relativistic effects might be negligible, but maybe not so much that we
