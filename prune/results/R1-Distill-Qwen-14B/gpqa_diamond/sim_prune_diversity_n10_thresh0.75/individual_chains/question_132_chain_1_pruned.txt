Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think: Benzene rings have 6 carbons. Each methyl group is CH3, so each adds one carbon and three hydrogens. Let me check the degrees of unsaturation. For C10H14: The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees: one benzene ring (3) and one double bond would give 4, but wait, benzene is three (each ring or double bond is one). So four would mean a benzene (3) and a ring or double bondâ€”no, wait, benzene contributes three, so an additional one, like another ring or a double bond. But the compound is aromatic, so probably the other is another ring, but wait, no, the molecular formula suggests each compound is a substituted benzene with methyl groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is C1H3. So each substitution adds C and H. Let me see: For a benzene substituted with, say, four methyl groups. Benzene is 6 C, four methyl groups add 4 C, so total 10 C. Hydrogen: Benzene has 6 H. Each methyl has 3 H, but substitution may affect that. Wait, when you substitute a benzene with a methyl group, each substitution replaces a H with the substituent. So each methyl adds 3-1=2 H? Wait, no. Actually, the benzene has six H. When you add a methyl group, each substitution replaces one H. So if you have four methyl groups, you would have
