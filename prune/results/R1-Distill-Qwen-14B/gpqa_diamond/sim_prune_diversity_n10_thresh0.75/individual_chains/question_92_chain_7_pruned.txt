Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, not too bad, but I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. It looks like there are two double bonds in this molecule. Wait, maybe I should count the number of each type of bond to apply the bond energy method.

Wait, the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. For carbon, that's breaking C-C bonds, right? So if I can figure out the number of C-C bonds in the molecule, I can calculate the total bond energy.

Wait, but I'm supposed to calculate the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for this molecule, which is a hydrocarbon, it's formed from carbon ( graphite? ) and hydrogen gas.

So the approach is: calculate the total bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule, then subtract from the sum of the bond energies of the elements in their standard states.

Wait, but the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:
