Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, I need to figure out which transition route and probability are correct when the state |3,0,0⟩ decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels, and each transition emits or absorbs a photon. The dipole transition has selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by +1 or -1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, +1, or -1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which means n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. Wait, but since it's a two-step process, it must go through an intermediate state. So first from n=3 to some n=2 or n=1? Wait, no, wait. Because in two dipole transitions, it's two steps. So from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1? Or maybe 3 to 1 directly? No, no, because each transition is dipole, so each must obey the selection rules.

Wait, but can it go directly from n=3 to n=1 in one dipole? Let me think. The selection rule for n is that Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but wait no, the dipole selection rules for hydrogen are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc. But wait, no, I think for dipole transitions, the electric dipole selection rule is Δn = ±1, but wait, no. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, for hydrogen, the main selection rules are:

Δl = ±1 (so l can change by +1 or -1)
Δm = 0, ±1
Δn can be any (no restriction), because the radial part allows for different n transitions as long as the angular parts are okay. Wait, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. For dipole transitions in hydrogen, the selection rule is Δl = ±1, and then Δn can be any, but the transition is only allowed if l changes by ±1. So in this case, the initial state is l=0, so the intermediate state must have l=1, because that's the only way to change by ±1.

So the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ must go to a state with l=1. So possible states are l=1, with m=0, ±1. So the possible n's for the intermediate state could be 2 or 4? Wait, n can be any, but for hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized, so from n=3, the possible l is up to n-1. So l can be 0,1,2 for n=3. So when it transitions to l=1, what's the possible n?

Wait, the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. So in the first transition, l must go from 0 → 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. So possible states are |2,1,m⟩ or |4,1,m⟩? But wait, n can't be greater than the initial n (3) in a dipole transition? Or can it? Wait, I think it can, because the selection rules don't restrict n as much as they do l and m. But in reality, higher n would be possible, but in the context of the problem, the decay is from 3 to 1, so probably it's going through n=2 as an intermediate.

So the first transition would go from n=3 to n=2, l=1, m=0,1, or -1. Then the second transition would go from n=2 to n=1, l=0, m=0.

So the possible first steps are |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1. Then from |2,1,m⟩, another dipole transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but when going from l=1 (n=2) to l=0 (n=1), the selection rules say Δl = -1, which is allowed. So that's a valid transition.

Now, the problem is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0, probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0, probability 1/4.

Wait, wait, but the dipole selection rules for m are Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, you can go to m=0, ±1.

So the initial state is m=0. So the first transition can have m=0 → m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate states could have m=0, ±1.

So the first step, from |3,0,0⟩ would go to |2,1, m⟩ where m is 0,1, or -1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Then from each of these, the second transition would go to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but each of these has different selection rules for m in the second transition. Let's think about that.

From |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

In the second transition, the m must change by Δm = 0, ±1.

So in the first step, m was 0 → m= some value.

Then in the second step, m must go from whatever it was to 0.

So for example, if in the first step, m was 0: from m=0 in n=2, l=1, to m=0 in n=1, l=0. So Δm must be 0 (allowed).

Similarly, if in the first step, m was +1, then in the second step, m must go from +1 to 0. Δm = -1 (allowed).

If in the first step, m was -1, then in the second step, m must go from -1 to 0. Δm= +1 (allowed).

So all three pathways are allowed.

Now, the question is, what's the probability of each of these. The given options A, B, C, D suggest that each has a certain probability.

But wait, the problem says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the total transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ with two steps, each a dipole transition.

So the overall probability would be the product of the transition probabilities for each step, assuming they are independent.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact probabilities, so I need to recall how transition probabilities are calculated.

In the electric dipole approximation, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial and final states. The matrix element is non-zero only when the selection rules are satisfied.

So for each dipole transition, the strength (and hence the probability) depends on the values of m and l.

But wait, in hydrogen, the transition probabilities are also dependent on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or the Wigner 3j symbols, but I'm not too clear on the exact expressions.

Wait, another approach. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the possible m values are 0, ±1. The transition dipole moment is non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

The probability amplitude for the transition is proportional to the integral involving the spherical harmonics Y_{l_initial m_initial} and Y_{l_final m_final}.

For the initial state Y_{0,0} and the final Y_{1,m}, the integral ∫ Y_{0,0} Y_{1,m} Y_1 dΩ would be zero unless certain conditions are met. Wait, but Y_0 is a constant (1/(2√π)), so the integral becomes Y_1,m integrated over the sphere, multiplied by 1. That would be zero except when m=0, because Y_1,m is zero when integrated against a constant? Wait, no.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{l', m'}* Y_{l, m} Y_{l'', m''} dΩ is the Gaunt coefficient, which is non-zero only when certain angular momentum coupling conditions are satisfied. In this case, the initial and final states are Y_{0,0} and Y_{1,m}, and the dipole operator Y_1^k (for k = -1, 0, +1).

Wait, actually, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1,m} for m=-1, 0, +1. So the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to <2,1,m | Y_{1, k} | 3,0,0>.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently.

The transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the square of the matrix element <2,1,m | e r Y_1^k |3,0,0⟩, where Y_1^k are the spherical harmonics for l=1 and m=k.

But since the initial state has l=0 (s-state), the only non-zero matrix elements would be when the spherical harmonics of the dipole (Y_1^k) connect the initial and intermediate states.

Wait, wait, the matrix element for the dipole transition is:

⟨2,1,m | e r Y_1^k |3,0,0⟩.

But Y_0^0 (since initial state is l=0) is a constant. So the integral becomes:

e ∫ Y_{1,m}^* (2) Y_{1,k} (r) Y_{0,0} (3) dΩ.

But since Y_{0,0} is a constant, the integral simplifies to e ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ.

Wait, but the integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ is zero unless m = -k. Because the product Y_{1,m} Y_{1,k} is involved in the Gaunt integral, which is non-zero only when m + k = 0, I think. Wait, no, perhaps when m + k = some other condition.

Wait, actually, the integral ∫ Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} dΩ is zero unless certain angular momentum coupling conditions are met. In this case, l1=1, m1=m; l2=1, m2=k; l3=0, m3=0.

So the integral will be non-zero only if m + k = 0, and the triangle conditions for angular momentum are satisfied. The triangle conditions require that l1 + l2 ≥ l3, and |l1 - l2| ≤ l3. Here, l3 is 0. So l1 + l2 must be ≥ 0 (which they are), and |l1 - l2| ≤ 0. That implies l1 = l2. So l1=1, l2=1.

So the condition is that m + k = 0. So k = -m.

Therefore, the matrix element is non-zero only when k = -m.

But the dipole operator has Y_1^k for k=-1,0,+1. So for each intermediate m in the first transition, the possible k is determined.

So for the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the dipole operator must have Y_1^{-m} to have a non-zero matrix element.

Wait, let me make a table:

If the intermediate m is 0, then k must be 0. So dipole operator has Y_1^0.

If m is +1, then k must be -1. So dipole operator Y_1^{-1}.

If m is -1, then k must be +1. So dipole operator Y_1^{+1}.

So for each m, the dipole operator component is fixed.

Now, the transition probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m | Y_1^{-m} |3,0,0⟩ |^2.

But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is Y_{0,0}, so the matrix element becomes proportional to ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-m} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

Wait, no, because the dipole operator is Y_1^{-m}, and the initial state is Y_{0,0}.

So the integral is ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-m} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π). So the integral is (1/(2√π)) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-m} dΩ.

Wait, but Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,-m} = |Y_{1,m}|^2, which is real and positive.

So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)) times ∫ |Y_{1,m}|^2 dΩ.

But ∫ |Y_{1,m}|^2 dΩ is 1, because the spherical harmonics are orthonormal. So the integral is 1/(2√π) * 1.

Wait, but that's just for each m?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The integral of Y_{l m}^* Y_{l' m'} Y_{l'' m''} over all angles is the Gaunt coefficient. In our case, l=1, m=m; l'=1, m' = -m; l''=0, m''=0.

So the Gaunt coefficient is non-zero only if certain conditions are met. The condition for the integral to be non-zero are that m + (-m) = 0 = M, which is m''=0. So that's okay.

But also, the triangle conditions on the angular momenta: l + l' ≥ l'', and |l - l'| ≤ l''.

Here, l=1, l'=1, l''=0.

So 1+1 ≥0: yes.

|1-1| ≤0: 0 ≤0: yes.

So the Gaunt integral is non-zero.

The value of the Gaunt coefficient for this case can be found, but I think for this purpose, each transition will have a certain probability. For each m, the transition probability from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ depends on the square of the matrix element, which depends on the Gaunt integral for that m.

But I'm not remembering the exact values, so perhaps I can think about the possible Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should think in terms of selection rules and possible m.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for each m are the same, so each of the three possible m values (0, +1, -1) would have equal probability in the first transition. That would mean each has a 1/3 chance. Then, the second transition would have another set of probabilities.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Perhaps the transition probabilities are not the same for each m.

Another approach: The transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ is dipole allowed, so the probability is non-zero only for m=0, ±1. But the actual probabilities may depend on the integral of the spherical harmonics.

Wait, perhaps the probability depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=1 and l=0 to get l=1.

Wait, when combining l=1 (dipole) and l=0 (s-state), the result is l=1. So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining Y_{1,m} and Y_{0,0} to get Y_{1, m}.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probability is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=1 and l=0 into l=1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact probabilities, so maybe I can think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) Two steps: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0. Probability 1/3.

B) 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

C) 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

D) 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0. Probability 2/3.

Wait, but option D says the transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, but the probability is 2/3. That seems high.

Wait, but why would the probability be 1/3, 1/4, or 2/3?

Another approach: The total probability is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes for each possible intermediate state. So suppose each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ (m=0, ±1) has a certain probability, and then each of those decays to the final state with their own probabilities.

But for the overall process, the total probability is the sum over all possible intermediates of (probability of first step to intermediate) × (probability of second step from intermediate to final).

Assuming that each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ has a certain probability p_m for the first transition, and then a certain probability q_m for the second transition, the total probability is sum (p_m * q_m).

So let's think about each possible m:

Case m=0:

First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩. The probability for this is p_0.

Second transition: |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. The probability for this is q_0.

So total contribution is p_0 * q_0.

Similarly for m=1 and m=-1.

Now, I need to find p_m and q_m for each m.

But how?

I recall that in hydrogen, the transition probability from n', l', m' to n, l, m is proportional to (2l' +1) * |d_{l m'}^{l'}|², where d_{l m'}^{l'} are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Or perhaps it's related to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the dipole transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For example, the transition amplitude is proportional to CG(l', m') × CG(l, m), where CG is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

Wait, I think the dipole transition matrix element is proportional to the product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining the angular momenta.

Alternatively, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the product of the CG coefficients.

Wait, perhaps the transition probability from |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to (2l1 +1) | (CG(l1, m1; 1, k; l2, m2)) |², where k is the component of the dipole operator (k= -1, 0, +1). So for each transition, we have to sum over k.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me think in terms of m values.

For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the transition is allowed only if m = k, where k is the component of the dipole operator (k = -1, 0, +1).

So for each m in |2,1,m⟩, the allowed k is m.

Wait, so the matrix element is non-zero only if m = k, and m can be -1,0,+1.

So for the first transition, each m corresponds to a different k in the dipole operator.

But the probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining l=0 (initial) and l=1 (dipole) to get l=1 (intermediate).

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l=1 is straightforward.

The CG coefficient for combining l1=0, m1=0 with l2=1, m2=k to get l=1, m=m2.

Wait, since l1=0, the CG coefficient is 1 when l=1 and m=m2. Because when you add angular momenta, if one is zero, the CG coefficient is delta_{m, m2}.

Wait, no. The CG coefficient for l1=0, m1=0 is:

CG(0,0; 1, k; 1, m) = δ_{k, m}.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The CG coefficients are defined such that:

| l1 m1 ⟩ | l2 m2 ⟩ = sum_{M} CG(l1, m1; l2, m2; L, M) | L M ⟩.

So for l1=0, m1=0, the state |0,0⟩ can only combine with |1, k⟩ to form |1, k⟩, since 0 + k = k.

So the CG coefficient is 1 when L=1 and M=k.

Therefore, the transition amplitude for the first step is proportional to CG(0,0; 1, k; 1, m) which is 1 when m=k.

Wait, but this seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the transition amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient for combining the initial state and the dipole operator to get the intermediate state.

Let me try to think again. The transition amplitude is proportional to:

⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1, k} |3,0,0⟩.

Since |3,0,0⟩ has l=0, Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π), so the matrix element becomes:

e/(2√π) ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ.

Which is e/(2√π) * ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ.

The integral is zero unless m = -k, because the product Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} must be such that their integral is non-zero only when m + k = 0 (due to orthogonality conditions). So m = -k.

Wait, no, wait. The integral of Y_{l, m} Y_{l', m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'.

So in this case, the integral of Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,k} is zero unless m = -k.

Wait, no. Wait, Y_{l, m}^* = (-1)^m Y_{l, -m}, so the integral is:

∫ Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, k} dΩ = ∫ (-1)^m Y_{1, -m} Y_{1, k} dΩ.

This is non-zero only if -m = k, i.e., k = -m.

So for each m, the allowed k is -m.

Therefore, the matrix element is non-zero only when k = -m.

But the dipole operator has components Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1, +1}.

So for m=0, the allowed k is 0.

For m=+1, the allowed k is -1.

For m=-1, the allowed k is +1.

So the matrix element is non-zero only for these cases.

The value of the matrix element for each case is:

For m=0, k=0: the integral is ∫ Y_{1,0}^* Y_{1,0} dΩ = 1.

So the amplitude is e/(2√π) * 1.

For m=+1, k=-1: the integral is ∫ Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,-1} dΩ.

But Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,-1} = |Y_{1,1}|^2 * (-1)^2 (since Y_{1,-1} = (-1)^-1 Y_{1,1}^* )? Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the actual value.

Wait, Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iθ} sinθ.

Y_{1,-1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ.

So their product Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,-1} = (3/(4π)) sin²θ.

The integral over all angles is ∫ (3/(4π)) sin²θ dΩ.

Wait, dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ.

So the integral becomes (3/(4π)) ∫ (sinθ)^3 dθ dφ.

But wait, ∫ (sinθ)^3 dθ from 0 to π is 4/3.

∫ dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π.

So the integral is (3/(4π)) * (4/3) * 2π = (3/(4π)) * (8π/3) )= 2.

Wait, but that can't be right because the integral over Y_{1, m}^* Y_{1, m'} must be zero unless m = m'.

Wait, I'm making a mistake here. Because Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,-1} is (Y_{1,1})^* * Y_{1,-1} = (sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ ) * (sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iθ} sinθ) ) = (3/(4π)) sin²θ.

So the integral becomes (3/(4π)) ∫ sin²θ * sinθ dθ dφ.

Which is (3/(4π)) * ∫ (sinθ)^3 dθ ∫ dφ.

∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3, as before. ∫ dφ is 2π.

So (3/(4π)) * (4/3) * 2π = (3/(4π)) * (8π/3) )= 2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the integral should be zero for m≠m'. So I must have an error in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me correct that.

Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iθ} sinθ.

Y_{1,-1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ.

So Y_{1,1}^* = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ.

Multiplying Y_{1,1}^* * Y_{1,-1} = (3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sin²θ * e^{-iθ} ?

Wait, no, Y_{1,1}^* is sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ, and Y_{1,-1} is sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iθ} sinθ?

Wait, no, Y_{l,m}(θ,φ) = sqrt( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * P_l^m (cosθ) e^{i m φ}.

So Y_{1,1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{iφ} sinθ.

Y_{1,-1} = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So Y_{1,1}^* = sqrt(3/(4π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ.

So Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,-1} = (3/(4π)) e^{-iφ} sinθ * e^{-iφ} sinθ = (3/(4π)) e^{-2iφ} sin²θ.

The integral over all φ and θ is:

∫ (3/(4π)) e^{-2iφ} sin²θ dΩ.

But ∫ e^{-2iφ} dφ from 0 to 2π is zero because ∫ e^{i n φ} dφ = 0 for n≠0. So this integral is zero.

Ah, so the integral is zero because m≠m'.

Wait, so for m=+1, the integral is zero, so the matrix element is zero. Similarly, for m=-1, the integral would also be zero because m= -1 and k=+1, leading to m + k =0, but the integral over φ would be zero.

Wait, but this seems conflicting with earlier reasoning because when m=0, the integral is non-zero.

So, putting it all together:

For the first transition, the only allowed m is 0, because for m=+1 and m=-1, the integrals are zero. So the first transition can only go to m=0, and the others are forbidden.

Wait, this is a key point. So the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is allowed, but the transitions to |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are forbidden because their integrals are zero.

If that's the case, then the only possible intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, and the transition occurs via that state. Then from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

So the overall route would be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Now, what is the probability of this route?

Assuming that only this transition is allowed, the probability would be 1, but looking at the options, option A has probability 1/3, and option D has probability 2/3.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because maybe the initial reasoning about the forbidden nature of m=+1 and m=-1 is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me re-examine the matrix element for m=+1.

The matrix element is:

⟨2,1,1 | Y_{1, k} |3,0,0⟩.

Because the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is Y_{0,0}, the integral is:

∫ Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,k} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π), so the integral becomes (1/(2√π)) ∫ Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ.

The integral ∫ Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,k} dΩ is zero unless k = -1, because for the product Y_{1,1}^* Y_{1,k} to be non-zero, the sum of the m's must be zero (since Y_{0,0} is involved). So k must be -1.

So Y_{1,k} must be Y_{1,-1}.

Thus, the matrix element is non-zero only when k=-1, which corresponds to m=+1 in the intermediate state.

Wait, but wait, the dipole operator is Y_{1,k}, and the initial state is |3,0,0⟩.

So when m=+1 in the intermediate state, the dipole operator must be Y_{1,-1} (k=-1), because m_initial + k = m_final.

So m_initial = 0 → 0 + (-1) = -1 → but the intermediate m is +1. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I have this reversed.

Wait, no, the selection rule is that the change in m is Δm = k. So m_final = m_initial + k.

But m_initial is 0, so m_final = k.

But the intermediate state is |2,1, m⟩, so m can be -1, 0, +1.

So for m=+1, k must be +1.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

The dipole operator Y_{1}^k has m = k. The transition occurs via absorbing or emitting a photon with angular momentum k, so the change in m is Δm = k.

So for the initial state m=0, the final m must be m = 0 + k.

So for the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, m = k.

So if the intermediate state has m=+1, then k=+1. So the dipole operator must be Y_{1, +1}.

Similarly, for m=0, k=0; and for m=-1, k=-1.

So the matrix element is non-zero only if the dipole operator's k matches the m of the intermediate state.

So for each m in the intermediate state, the dipole operator must be Y_{1,m}.

Thus, the matrix element becomes:

⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,m} |3,0,0⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{1,m}^* Y_{1,m} Y_{0,0} dΩ.

But Y_{0,0} is a constant, so it's (1/(2√π)) ∫ |Y_{1,m}|^2 dΩ.

The integral ∫ |Y_{1,m}|^2 dΩ is 1, because the spherical harmonics are orthonormal.

So the matrix element is (1/(2√π)) *1.

Wait, but this would be the same for all m. So the probability would be the same for each m.

But wait, earlier I thought the integral would be zero for m ≠ 0, but that was under the wrong assumption. So perhaps all three transitions are allowed, each with the same probability.

So the first transition can go to m=0, +1, or -1, each with equal probability.

So the probability for each m is (1/3) × something.

Wait, but the transition probability is proportional to |⟨2,1,m | Y_{1,m} |3,0,0⟩ |^2.

Which, as we've found, is (1/(2√π))^2 × 1.

So each of the three transitions has the same probability, so each has probability 1/3.

So the first transition has a 1/3 chance for each m, and the second transition would have a certain probability.

Wait, but the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Again, the dipole selection rules for this transition are Δm=0, ±1, and Δl=−1.

So from |2,1,m⟩, the l must go to 0, so l=0.

So the only possible transition is to |1,0,0⟩.

But what about the m?

The final state has m=0. So the change in m must be Δm = -m. Because initial m is m, and final is 0. So Δm = -m.

So for the dipole operator in the second transition, the k must be -m.

Because Δm = k.

So for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator must have k = -m.

Thus, the matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | Y_{1, -m} |2,1,m⟩.

Because the initial state in this transition is |2,1,m⟩.

So the matrix element is proportional to ∫ Y_{0,0}^* Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} dΩ.

Again, Y_{0,0} is 1/(2√π), so the integral becomes (1/(2√π)) ∫ Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} dΩ.

But Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} = |Y_{1,m}|^2 when m is real. Wait, no, because Y_{1,-m} = (-1)^m Y_{1,m}^*.

So Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} = |Y_{1,m}|^2 when m is positive? Wait, no, let's compute.

Y_{1,m} = sqrt(3/(4π)) * P_1^m (cosθ) e^{i m φ}.

Y_{1,-m} = sqrt(3/(4π)) * P_1^{-m} (cosθ) e^{-i m φ}.

So Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} = (3/(4π)) [P_1^m P_1^{-m}] e^{i m φ} e^{-i m φ} = (3/(4π)) P_1^m P_1^{-m}.

Wait, but P_1^m (x) = (-1)^m P_1^m (x) = P_1^{-m} (x), because the associated Legendre polynomials satisfy P_l^m (x) = (-1)^m P_l^{-m} (x).

So P_1^m (x) = (-1)^m P_1^{-m} (x).

So Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} = (3/(4π)) [ (-1)^m P_1^m (x) ]^2.

Wait, no, let's compute it properly. P_1^m (x) = (-1)^m P_1^{-m}(x).

So P_1^{-m} (x) = (-1)^m P_1^m (x).

So Y_{1,-m} Y_{1,m} = (3/(4π)) [P_1^m (x)]^2.

So the integral becomes (1/(2√π)) * (3/(4π)) ∫ [P_1^m (x)]^2 sinθ dθ dx (since x=cosθ).

Wait, but the integral of [P_1^m (x)]^2 over x from -1 to 1 is zero unless m=0.

Because P_1^m are orthogonal. So for m≠0, the integral is zero.

Wait, because for l=1, the associated Legendre polynomials P_1^m are orthogonal for different m. So ∫ [P_1^m (x)]^2 dx is zero unless m=0.

Wait, no. The associated Legendre polynomials for the same l and different m are orthogonal:

∫_{-1}^1 P_l^m (x) P_l^{m'} (x) dx = 0 for m ≠ m'.

So if m ≠0, the integral of [P_1^m (x)]^2 is zero. Therefore, for m≠0, the integral is zero.

Thus, the matrix element is zero unless m=0.

So the second transition is only allowed if the intermediate state has m=0.

Thus, the second transition can only occur if the first transition went to m=0.

So the only possible route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

Therefore, the probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

The first step's probability is 1/3 (since there are three possible m values, each with equal probability, so 1/3 each).

The second step's probability is for m=0, which can only transition to m=0 in the final state. So the probability for the second step is 1, because it's the only possible path.

Wait, but earlier we thought that the second transition's probability depends on the matrix element. But according to the calculation, the second transition is only allowed if m=0.

So the overall probability is the product of the first step's probability (1/3) and the second step's probability (1), giving 1/3.

But looking at the options:

Option A says the route is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but what about the other options? They involve transitions to m=1 and m=-1, but we've just determined that those intermediate states cannot transition to the final state because their matrix elements are zero.

Thus, the correct route is option A.


The problem involves determining the correct transition route and probability for the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to decay to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions
1. **Angular momentum (l):** Δl = ±1.
2. **Magnetic quantum number (m):** Δm = 0, ±1.

### Initial and Final States
- **Initial state:** |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).
- **Final state:** |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).

The decay occurs in two steps, with an intermediate state. The intermediate state must have l=1 (since Δl = ±1), and the possible m values are m=−1, 0, +1.

### First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩
- The initial state has l=0, so the intermediate state must have l=1.
- The possible intermediate states are |2,1,−1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,+1⟩.
- The transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements involving the dipole operator. For hydrogen, the matrix elements depend on the spherical harmonics \( Y_{l,m} \).
- The calculation shows that the transition probabilities are equal for the three possible m values (m=−1, 0, +1), so each has a probability of \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Second Transition: |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩
- The final state has l=0, so the intermediate state must have l=1.
- The final state has m=0, so the change in m (Δm) must satisfy \( m_{\text{final}} - m_{\text{intermediate}} = 0 \), meaning the intermediate state must have m=0.
- For m=0, the transition is allowed, but for m=±1, the transition is forbidden because the matrix elements are zero (orthogonality of spherical harmonics).

### Overall Transition Route and Probability
- The only allowed route is \( |3,0,0⟩ \rightarrow |2,1,0⟩ \rightarrow |1,0,0⟩ \).
- The probability of the first step is \( \frac{1}{3} \), and the probability of the second step is 1 (since it is the only allowed transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩).
- The total probability is the product of the probabilities of the two steps: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A:** \( |3,0,0⟩ \rightarrow |2,1,0⟩ \rightarrow |1,0,0⟩ \), probability \( \frac{1}{3} \). This matches the derived route and probability.
- **Option B:** \( |3,0,0⟩ \rightarrow |2,1,1⟩ \rightarrow |1,0,0⟩ \), probability \( \frac{1}{4} \). This is incorrect because the transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden.
- **Option C:** \( |3,0,0⟩ \rightarrow |2,1,-1⟩ \rightarrow |1,0,0⟩ \), probability \( \frac{1}{4} \). This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D:** \( |3,0,0⟩ \rightarrow |2,1,0⟩ \rightarrow |1,0,0⟩ \), probability \( \frac{2}{3} \). This is incorrect because the probability is \( \frac{1}{3} \), not \( \frac{2}{3} \).

### Final Answer
The correct transition route and probability are given in **Option A**.
