Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it reflects or emits others, right? The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I think I need to figure out what color that corresponds to.

Wait, wait. Oh right, energy and wavelength are related. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So if I know the energy, I can find the wavelength and then figure out the color.

Let me jot down the numbers. E is 2.3393 eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. But wait, maybe I don't need to convert to joules. Oh, wait! There's a handy shortcut for converting eV to wavelength in nanometers. I think the formula is λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV). Does that sound right? Because 1240 eV·nm is a common approximation for hc when using nm units.

So plugging in the numbers: 1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1240 divided by 2 is 620, but since it's a bit more than 2, the wavelength will be a bit less than 620. Let me get more precise. 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 ≈ let's see. 2.34 times 500 is about 1170, which is a bit less than 1240. So maybe 530 nm? Wait, wait, wait. Let me do it correctly. 2.3393 multiplied by 530 is about 1243, which would give E as close to 1240/530 ≈ 2.34. So the wavelength is approximately 530 nm.

Wait, but wait, the energy is the energy of the emitted light. Oh, but when a dye absorbs light, it's because it's absorbing a higher energy photon and then emits a lower energy photon. Or wait, no, the dye emits light when it goes from an excited state to a lower energy level. So the energy difference between these states is the energy of the emitted photon.

Wait, actually, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. To find the color it absorbs, I think I need to look at the absorbed energy, which is higher than the emitted. Or wait, no—maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me think. Electrons in the dye are promoted from a lower energy level to a higher one when they absorb a photon. Then, when they drop back down, they emit a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait
