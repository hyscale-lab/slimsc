Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

Alright, the setup is about two planets in the same star system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and orbits a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. This second planet should also exhibit both transit and occultation events, so I need to find the longest possible period it can have while still doing that.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on what transit and occultation events mean. From what I remember, a transit is when a planet passes directly in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in the star's brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its light, which is a different kind of event. For both to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet's path brings it in front and behind the star from Earth's perspective. So the planets need to have aligned orbital planes, which they do in this problem.

But how does that affect the orbital periods? Hmm.

I think the key here is about the Hill sphere or something related to orbital stability, but maybe it's more about the orbital dynamics concerning transits and occultations. Wait, no, I'm probably mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the condition for a planet to be able to transitâ€”specifically, the planet's orbital period can't be too much longer or shorter than the first one's because they share the same orbital plane.

Wait, no, the question is about the maximum period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation occur. I think the main point here relates to the synodic period or something about how often the two planets align in a way that we can observe both events.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about when a planet can transit. The transit happens when the planet's orbit brings it directly in front of the star. For another planet in the same system, the transits and occultations would depend on
