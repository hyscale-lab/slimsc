Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. So, the question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I remember that l is the orbital quantum number, which for p orbitals is 1. So each electron has l=1, right? So l1 is 1 and l2 is 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both measurements give -침. So each electron's Lz component is -침. Since each Lz has eigenvalues m침, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, if m is -1, then Lz is -침.

Wait, but the total state is |1,1,2,-1>. I think this means that the two electrons have combined their angular momenta. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and its m is -1. But how does that relate to the individual m1 and m2?

I remember that when you couple two angular momenta, say l1 and l2, the possible total l values are l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, ..., down to |l1 - l2|. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so l can be 2, 1, or 0.

The state in question is |1,1,2,-1>, which is the highest l state, l=2, and m=-1. But wait, for l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So m=-1 is possible.

Now, the total m is m1 + m2, right? Because Lz for the total state is L1z + L2z. So in the coupled state, m = m1 + m2 = -1. But the question is asking for the probability that each individual m1 and m2 is -1. So m1 =
