Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it slow.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their interaction's developmental fate. They've done some genetic engineering with a bicistronic vector, and after some experiments, they're not seeing a green signal under the microscope. I need to figure out why.

First, let's parse the setup. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames), so two genes in one vector. The vector is probably using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something similar to allow both ORFs to be translated.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So the vector structure is something like: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF with stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) and mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF with a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) and eGFP at the C-terminus.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning loading controls are fine. So the issue isn't with the blot itself.

They bred mice homozygous for their construct in a wild-type background. Then crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Cre is a recombinase that recognizes loxP sites. When Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

Wait, so in the vector, the ligand has a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so using SOX10-Cre would presumably activate the expression of both ligand and receptor in neural crest-derived cells.

But after the offspring are born, they don't see a green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed or is not fluorescent.

Let's think about the possible issues. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression in the same cells, I think. If they were paracrine, maybe the ligand would be secreted, but the vector is for expression in the same cells. Not sure if this affects the GFP expression. Maybe not the reason for no green.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So, eGFP is a reporter for proper protein trafficking. If it's stuck in Golgi, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. Or perhaps it does, but if the receptor isn't trafficked, maybe it's not expressed. But I'm not sure if this is the primary issue. Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under certain promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under an IRES, which I think allows for internal ribosome entry, so it's usually expressed at lower levels than the first gene. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But wait, the vector is using the CBA promoter for the ligand, and IRES for the receptor. What about the presence of enhancers in the construct? If the construct lacks enhancers, maybe the expression isn't driven correctly. But in this setup, the ligand is under CBA, which is a constitutive promoter, so I'm not sure if enhancers are needed. Maybe the IRES isn't working, but that would affect the receptor expression.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they are not in frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed correctly. However, the question says the ligand and receptor are each fused to mCherry and eGFP, respectively. So the receptor ORF is probably in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, then the eGFP might not be present. But if the Cre didn't work, the stop would remain.

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. In the ligand's case, it's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272. SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the control of SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. Cre is a site-specific recombination enzyme. The loxP sites are recognized by Cre, and the stop cassettes would be excised only when Cre is present.

So in the parental mice, which are homozygous for the construct, the ligand and receptor have stop cassettes. When they're crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in
