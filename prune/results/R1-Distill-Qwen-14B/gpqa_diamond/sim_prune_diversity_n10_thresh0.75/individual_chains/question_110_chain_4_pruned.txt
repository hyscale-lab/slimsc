Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question gives me some information about the magnitude limits of each instrument.

From what I remember, apparent magnitude determines how bright a star appears from Earth. Lower magnitudes mean brighter stars. BothESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag, while HIRES can go down to V=16 mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude â‰¤16, because HIRES can't see beyond that. Wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than X mag" can be observed. Oh, wait, I think I got that wrong. If a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than (lower than) a certain value, the instrument can observe it. So, for ESPRESSO, stars with V <17 are observable. HIRES can see V <16.

So a star that is brighter than V=16 mag would be observable by both. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter than 17, meaning apparent V <=17? Because higher magnitude numbers are dimmer. So, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star's V is less than 17,
