Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity arises when a compound has chiral centers, which are centers with four different substituents. But wait, there's also something about meso compounds, which are compounds that have chiral centers but are achiral overall because of a plane or center of symmetry. So, I need to check each compound for whether they have chiral centers and whether they're meso or not.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
   The structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3, but wait, the double bond is at position 1? Wait, butene is four carbons. So it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Hmm, wait, maybe it's (Z) configuration. But regardless, the question is about optical activity. So for a compound to be optically active, it must have at least one chiral center. Let's see: the molecule here is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the first carbon (C1) has Cl, two CH2 groups (maybe?), wait, no. Let me think. The structure is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be four carbons. So the first carbon is CH2Cl, second is C(CH3)=, then CH2. But wait, the second carbon is double-bonded, so it can't have four substituents. So the double bond would be between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1 is Cl, and what else? It's attached to C2 (double bond), and perhaps two other substituents. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3 if single bond, but it's a double bond. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1: Cl, double bond to C2 (which has CH(CH3)), and maybe two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would
