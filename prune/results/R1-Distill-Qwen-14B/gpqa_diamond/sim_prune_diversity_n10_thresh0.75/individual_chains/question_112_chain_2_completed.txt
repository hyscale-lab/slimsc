Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, so I think the first thing I need to do is normalize |alpha>. But wait, the question mentions that it's proportional, so maybe I don't need to immediately normalize it because I'm looking for probabilities which are based on the squared magnitudes regardless of the overall normalization factor. Hmm, but to find the probabilities, I probably need to normalize it because probabilities must add up to 1.

So let's break it down. The state is given as |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where 'a' is the proportionality constant. Oh wait, no, the problem says it's proportional, so I think I can write it as |alpha> = C*(1+i)|up> + C*(2-i)|down>, where C is a normalization constant. Wait no, wait, the state is proportional to that sum, so perhaps it's (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by some constant. But for normalization, I need to calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself and set it to 1.

Wait, the normalization factor is 1 divided by the square root of the inner product. So let's compute the inner product. The inner product of |alpha> is (1+i)* (1-i) + (2-i)*(2+i). Let me compute each term.

(1+i)(1-i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2-i)(2+i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the inner product is 2 +5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Wait, but wait, no. Because the inner product <alpha|alpha> is |C|^2 times [(1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)] which as we saw is 7. So to make it 1, C must be 1/sqrt(7), because |C|^2 is 1/7, so 1/7 *7=1.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the first part of the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise.

Wait, wait, what operator is this? The matrix elements are zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So in the basis |up>, |down>, the operator is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:
[ 0    ħ/2
  ħ/2  0 ]

Hmm, what operator has this form? I think this might be the spin-x operator multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we have ħ/2 times X, that would give the matrix above. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator. Let me think: the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the problem says the operator has eigenstates. So the eigenstates of this operator are the same as those of σ_x, which are the superpositions I mentioned.

So the first task is to find the probabilities of measuring the system in each eigenstate of this operator. That is, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the coefficients' squared magnitudes as the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator is proportional to σ_x, perhaps we can think in terms of the spin-x basis. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x.

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given in the |up> and |down> basis. So perhaps it's easier to compute the components in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Alternatively, since the operator's matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], the eigenstates are as I said.

Let me proceed step by step. Let me first write |alpha> in the |up>, |down> basis. So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), as we found earlier.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, to find the probability of getting each eigenstate of the operator A (which is the same as the eigenstates of σ_x), I need to express |alpha> in the basis of |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me find the coefficients c_+x and c_-x such that |alpha> = c_+x |+x> + c_-x |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

We can solve for a and b.

Expressing in terms of |up> and |down>:

a |+x> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
b |-x> = b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Adding them:

|alpha> = [a + b] |up> / sqrt(2) + [a - b] |down> / sqrt(2).

But |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, the coefficients must match:

[a + b]/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),
[a - b]/sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So we have two equations:

1. a + b = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ?

Wait, wait, let me see. Wait, the right-hand side is (1+i)/sqrt(7). So:

[a + b]/sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7),
[a - b]/sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So let me write this as:

a + b = (1 + i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7),
a - b = (2 - i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7).

Let me compute these right-hand sides.

First, compute (1 + i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7):

(1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{i pi/4}, so sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) e^{i pi/4} = (2/sqrt(7)) e^{i pi/4}. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, just note that (1 + i) = sqrt(2) (1/sqrt(2) + i/sqrt(2)) ), which is sqrt(2) multiplied by e^{i pi/4}.

But perhaps I should just solve for a and b.

We have:

a + b = (1 + i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7),
a - b = (2 - i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7).

Let me add these two equations:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)
=> 2a = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the first:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> 2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So, now, the coefficients a and b are known.

The probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |a|^2, and the probability for |-x> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = (9 * 2) / (4 * 7) ) = (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is a part of some options.

Compute |b|^2:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] * (2) / (4 *7).

Because | (-1 + 2i) |^2 is (1 +4) =5, multiplied by (sqrt(2))^2/(2 sqrt(7))^2) ?

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

|b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) * (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 )

Wait, no, actually, |b|^2 is [ ( (-1) + 2i ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ] multiplied by its complex conjugate. So:

|b|^2 = [ ( (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) ] * [ (-1 - 2i) ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

Multiply the numerators and denominators.

Numerators: [ (-1 + 2i)(-1 - 2i) ] * (sqrt(2))^2 = [ (1 + 2i -2i -4i²) ] * 2 = [1 +4 ] *2 = 5 *2 =10.

Denominator: [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ] = 4 *7 =28.

So |b|^2 = 10 /28 =5/14 ≈0.3571429.

Wait, but 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (approx 0.642857) for |+x> and 5/14 (approx 0.3571) for |-x>.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → 0.64 and 0.36 are close to 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.3571.

But the probability for |+x> is 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is approximately 0.64, and for |-x> it's about 0.3571, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places.

So in option A, the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, so that matches.

Now the second part of the question is to find the average value of the operator A. The operator A is given by the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the average value would be (ħ/2) <sigma_x>, which is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

Alternatively, compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute A|alpha> first. Since A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], and |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, A|alpha> = (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 -i)) |up> + ( (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) |down> ) / sqrt(7).

So,

A|alpha> = [ ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) |up> + ( (ħ/2)(1+i) ) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i) ( (ħ/2)(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7) ) + (2 +i) ( (ħ/2)(1 +i) ) / sqrt(7) ) ].

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i) [ (ħ/2)(2 - i) ] + (2 + i) [ (ħ/2)(1 + i) ] ] / sqrt(7)

Wait no, wait. |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). So <alpha| is [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] / sqrt(7).

So, when you apply A to |alpha>, you get:

A |alpha> = ( (0)(1+i) + (ħ/2)(2 - i) ) |up> / sqrt(7) + ( (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) ) |down> / sqrt(7).

So,

A |alpha> = [ (ħ/2)(2 - i) |up> + (ħ/2)(1 + i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, compute the inner product <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] / sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2)(2 - i) |up> + (ħ/2)(1 + i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)

Multiply the two 1/sqrt(7) terms, giving 1/7.

Then, the product becomes:

(1 - i)(ħ/2)(2 - i) * <up|up> + (1 - i)(ħ/2)(1 + i) <up|down> + (2 + i)(ħ/2)(2 - i) <down|up> + (2 + i)(ħ/2)(1 + i) <down|down>

Since <up|up> =1, <down|down>=1, and <up|down>=0.

So, the cross terms (those with <up|down> and <down|up>) are zero.

So, the expression simplifies to:

(1 - i)(ħ/2)(2 - i) *1 + (2 + i)(ħ/2)(1 + i)*1 ) * (1/7)

Factor out (ħ/2) and (1/7):

= (ħ/(2*7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) [since i²= -1]
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i +i + i²
= 2 +3i -1 [since i² =-1]
=1 +3i.

So sum of the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) = 2.

So the average value is (ħ/(14)) * 2 = ħ/7.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says average is ħ/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7 → matches.

Wait, but wait, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.642857 and 0.35714. So 0.64 and 0.36 are rounded versions.

So the correct option is A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait a second, in the first part, I thought of the operator as (ħ/2) sigma_x, so the average value would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

Alternatively, compute <sigma_x> in |alpha>:

<sigma_x> = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7.

Wait, let me calculate that.

Compute numerator:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2= 2-3i -1=1-3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i)=2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2= 2+3i -1=1+3i.

Sum: (1-3i)+(1+3i)=2.

So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So <A> = (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which confirms the earlier calculation.

So the average is ħ/7, and probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.357).

Looking at the options, option A matches.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

This normalization ensures that the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator add up to 1.

### Step 1: Eigenstates of the Operator
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, and its eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 2: Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) Basis
To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Using the definitions of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) such that:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+x\rangle + b|-x\rangle
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we equate coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) to match \( |\alpha\rangle \). This gives:

\[
a + b = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad a - b = \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Solving these equations, we find:

\[
a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}, \quad b = \frac{(-1+2i)\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{7}}
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14}
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

### Step 3: Average Value of the Operator
The average value of \( A \) is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Substituting \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we compute the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \). Using the components of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7}
\]

Thus, the average value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
