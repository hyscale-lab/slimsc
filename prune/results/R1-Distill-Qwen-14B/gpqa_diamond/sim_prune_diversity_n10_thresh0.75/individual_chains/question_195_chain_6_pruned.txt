Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. 

Wait, what's a transit and an occultation? I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, so it's blocking some of the star's light. An occultation, I think, is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is hidden from view. So for both to happen, the second planet must pass in front and behind the first planet relative to us. Hmm, maybe I need to think about their orbital positions.

Wait, no. Actually, the transit is when a planet passes in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. The occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light (if any, but in this case, we're probably talking about the planet being blocked, so maybe the light curve doesn't change much then. Or perhaps it's the opposite: when the planet is behind, we don't see its reflected light, but if it's a small planet, maybe the star's light is too bright anyway. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the orbital mechanics here.

So both planets are in the same system, same star, same orbital plane. The first planet's orbital period is 3 days. The second's period is what we're trying to find, with the maximum period. 

Wait, why would there be a maximum? I think it's because if the second planet's period is too long, the two planets won't align in such a way that both transits and occultations occur. Because for both to happen, the second planet must either catch up to or be overtaken by the first planet in their orbits. So their orbital periods must be such that their orbital speeds allow them to align in these positions regularly.

But wait, the first planet is smaller and has a much shorter period
