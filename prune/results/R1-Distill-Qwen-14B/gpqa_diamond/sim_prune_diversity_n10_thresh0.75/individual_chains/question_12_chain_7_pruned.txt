Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let's see what the problem says.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion Pi(+) is at rest, and we're supposed to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay should be zero, right? So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense because momentum is a vector quantity.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think for this problem, the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others. So maybe we can approximate its mass as zero. That should simplify things.

So the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. So their magnitudes are equal, but opposite in direction.

Let me think about the energy conservation equation. The total energy after decay is the energy of the muon plus the energy of the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero). So:

Energy conservation: E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino

Which is,

139.6 MeV = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

But wait, m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. So substituting that in:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu

So, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So the sum of their kinetic energies is 33.9 MeV.

Now, for momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) equals the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). Let's denote p_mu = p_nu = p.

The energies of both particles can be expressed in terms of their momenta and masses. For the muon, which has mass, the energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c
