Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I remember that NMR helps determine the structure by showing the environment of each hydrogen. The peaks tell us about the neighboring hydrogens and their coupling. So, I need to analyze each peak and see what they indicate.

The NMR data given is: 
- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quadruplets
- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet

Hmm, okay. Let's start by breaking down each part.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably an acetyl group (OAc). Because in acetates, the acetyl's methyl group is usually around 2 ppm and appears as a singlet since all three hydrogens are equivalent and there are no neighboring hydrogens to split it.

Then, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. That's likely a methyl group adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 or a CH that's part of a double bond. Since it's a doublet, it's coupled with one neighboring proton. So, possibly a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is attached to a double bond. Wait, but wait, propenyl or butenyl would have double bonds. Let me think about the structure.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That's a bit tricky. A doublet of quartets suggests that this proton is coupling with two different sets of equivalent protons, each with a different coupling constant. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets of doublets? Wait, no, the question says it's a dq, so probably two coupling constants. Maybe it's a proton that's next to a CH2 and a CH group, each causing splitting. Or maybe it's a trans or cis situation in a double bond.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which I remember is typical for protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. So this might be a vinyl proton adjacent to another vinyl proton. For a trans double bond, the coupling (J) is around 16 Hz. Cis double bonds usually have smaller coupling, like around 10 Hz. Wait, no, wait, I think I might have that backwards. Wait, no, wait: in a trans double bond (like trans-stilbene), the vicinal coupling (J) is larger, around 16 Hz, while in cis it's smaller, perhaps around 10 Hz. So the peak at 7.0 ppm being a doublet with J=16 suggests that this proton is coupled to another proton across the double bond in a trans configuration. So that would be a trans double bond.

So, let me put this together. The compound is an
