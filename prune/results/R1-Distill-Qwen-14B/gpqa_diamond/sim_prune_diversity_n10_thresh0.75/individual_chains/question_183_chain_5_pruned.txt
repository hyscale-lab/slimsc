Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed from a reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I should draw the structure to visualize it better. Let me picture the cyclohexene ring. The numbering starts at one point, so position 2 has a formyl group (which is a CHO), position 3 is a double bond (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and position 5 has a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2 but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- so maybe it's attached to the ring.

Wait, 5-vinyl would mean a vinyl group at position 5. And 3-enecarboxylic acid means a carboxylic acid group attached at position 3? Or wait, the parent chain is cyclohexene with substituents. Let me think: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, there's a carboxylic acid group at carbon 3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. No, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene is the base, and the carboxylic acid is attached at position 3. So at position 3, there's a COOH group. Then at position 2, a formyl (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH2, but the substituent is -CH2-CH2-? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the group would be attached as -CH2-CH2? No, wait, it's a substituent on the ring. So position 5 is attached to a CH2CH2 group, but with a double bond, so it's CH2=CH2. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond between C3 and C4) substituted with a CHO at C2, a COOH at C3, and a CH2=CH- group at C5.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. Let me try again. The base is cyclohex-3-ene, meaning the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Oh wait, but wait, the full name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3, as a substituent. So the structure would be:

- Carbon 1: connected to C2 and C6.
- Carbon 2: connected to C1, C3, and a formyl group (CHO).
- Carbon 3: connected to C2, C4, and a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.
- Carbon 4: connected to C3, C5, and maybe double bond to C3? Wait, the cyclohexene is at position 3, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring is C1-C2-C3=C4-C5-C6-C1.

Wait, no, the numbering would go such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C3 and C4 are double-bonded. Then, substituents are located at C2 (CHO), C5 (vinyl group), and C3 (COOH, but wait, if it's cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, the COOH is at position 3 of the cyclohexene ring. So yes, that's correct.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a
