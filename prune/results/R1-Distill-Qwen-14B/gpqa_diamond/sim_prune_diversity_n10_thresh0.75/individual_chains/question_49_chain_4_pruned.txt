Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I need to figure out the products for each of the three reactions given. Let me take it step by step.

First, let me recall what a sigmatropic rearrangement is. I think it's a type of pericyclic reaction where a sigma bond moves, and a pi bond shifts in a conjugated manner. The general form is something like [i,j] sigmatropic rearrangement, where i and j are the number of atoms on each side of the migrating bond. Oh right, examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements.

Looking at the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Wait, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with acid and heat. Hmm. I'm trying to think what kind of reaction this would be. Maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but with an amine involved.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on a central carbon, which is attached to an amine. So structure-wise, it's like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. Oh wait, but when you have two methoxy groups on a carbon adjacent to an amine, maybe it's a situation for a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, but the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure is CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, but wait: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? Or is it CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but
