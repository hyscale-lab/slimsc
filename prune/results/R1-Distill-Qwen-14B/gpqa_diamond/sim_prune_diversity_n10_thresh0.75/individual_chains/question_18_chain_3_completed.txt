Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let's break it down. So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, I remember that the notation like [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] are logarithmic abundance ratios. The brackets mean "logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance relative to another, divided by the Sun's abundance." Or wait, more precisely, [X/Y]_star = log10(n_X/n_Y)_star - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh right, because it's a logarithmic scale.

So, given that, let's look at the data. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Hmm, [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. Since it's 0, that means [Fe/H]_1 = log(n_Fe/n_H)_star1 - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_star1 = same as Sun. So Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun's Fe abundance.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Sun's photosphere has some given values: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 12 plus something equals 7.5? That would mean the something is negative. Let me compute that. 12 + x =7.5 → x= -4.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Which is about 3.16e-5. But wait, that's the Sun's value. But wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so its nFe/nH is same as Sun. So Star_1 has same Fe as Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg abundance in Star_2 is same as Sun. 

Now, what about the other abundances? 

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. This means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. 

But wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is what? Let me calculate. For the Sun, n_Fe/n_H=10^(-4.5), as per the given data. Oh wait, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be based on their photospheric composition. Wait, the problem gives the Sun's photospheric composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So for H, I think. Wait, n_X/nH is the number density of X relative to H. So for Fe, log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, Mg is log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5. 

Wait, but for Si, we don't have the Sun's data. So I need to find the Sun's [Si/Fe] value. Because for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, which is relative to the Sun.

So the Sun's [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. How to find that?

Well, because in the Sun, n_Si can be expressed in terms of H, so n_Si = (n_Si/n_H) * n_H. But we don't have the Sun's n_Si/n_H. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the problem doesn't require knowing the Sun's Si abundance, but only the relative ratios between the stars.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express each star's Si abundance in terms of H and then compare.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =0.3. So,

n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log10(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - (log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun) =0 → n_Fe/n_H)_1 = same as Sun.

So, n_Fe)_1 = n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1 / n_H)_sun.

Wait, but without knowing the actual H abundance in the stars, perhaps I can relate their Si and Mg abundances.

Wait, but let's look at Star_2's data.

Star_2:
[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 - log10(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log10(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =0 → n_Mg)_2 /n_H)_2 = same as Sun.

So for Star_2, Mg is same as Sun, and the ratio of Mg/Si is 0.3 dex higher than Sun. So, n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Now, I need to relate this to the Si abundance.

Wait, but how? Let me think.

We are to find the ratio (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

Perhaps I can express each star's n_Si in terms of n_H, and then take the ratio.

But for that, I need to find n_Si in each star in terms of their H.

Let me handle Star_1 first.

Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1=0 → their Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. So, n_Fe)_1 / n_H)_1 = n_Fe)_sun / n_H)_sun.

Wait, but I think it's more accurate to say that [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which implies that (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So, the ratio n_Fe)_1 /n_H)_1 = same as Sun.

So, n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun) * (n_H)_1 /n_H)_sun.

But we don't know the ratio of H in the stars. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si in terms of n_Fe and the [Si/Fe] ratio.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =0.3.

So, n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

We can write n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_Fe)_1 / (n_Fe)_sun ) * 10^(0.3).

Wait, because n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = (n_Si)_1 / (n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun/(n_Fe)_sun.

So, (n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_Fe)_1 / (n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, (n_Fe)_1 / (n_H)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun / (n_H)_sun → (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1 / (n_H)_sun.

Hmm, but without knowing (n_H)_1, perhaps it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of (n_Si)_sun and (n_H)_sun.

Wait, let me think about what I need to find. The ratio (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2.

So, let me compute each star's (n_Si) relative to the Sun's (n_Si).

Wait, perhaps I can express (n_Si)_1 as (n_Si)_sun * 10^([Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_sun?), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the abundance ratios.

Alternative approach: for each star, express the number density of Si relative to H.

Because the ratio (n_Si/n_H)_1 and (n_Si/n_H)_2 would then be the key to finding the desired ratio.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

So, n_Si/n_H)_1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun) * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Which is 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

But (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun = (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

So, n_Si/n_H)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_H)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

So, (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_2 * (n_H/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * (n_H/n_Si)_2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * (n_H/n_Si)_sun.

So,

10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * (n_H/n_Si)_sun = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun * (n_H/n_Si)_2.

Divide both sides by (n_Mg/n_H)_sun:

10^0.3 * (n_H/n_Si)_sun = (n_H/n_Si)_2.

Thus,

(n_H/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H/n_Si)_sun → (n_Si/n_H)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun / 10^0.3.

So, (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H)_2.

But wait, I can express (n_Si)_2 in terms of (n_Si)_sun: (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H)_2.

But how does n_H relate between the stars? Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see.

Wait, the ratio (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 is what we need.

From Star_1: (n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun.

From Star_2: (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H)_2.

But wait, that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can express (n_Si)_2 in terms of (n_Si)_sun.

Wait, let me think again.

(n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun.

For Star_2, from earlier:

(n_Si/n_H)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun / 10^0.3.

So, (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun /10^0.3 * n_H)_2.

But I don't know how n_H)_2 relates to the Sun.

Wait, but perhaps since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and Star_1's Fe is same as Sun, but Star_2's Fe abundance isn't given. Wait, but Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0. So, n_Mg)_2 = same as Sun. But how does that relate to H?

Hmm, perhaps I need to find the ratio of H in each star. But without knowing the H abundance, maybe I can express (n_Si)_1 and (n_Si)_2 in terms of (n_Si)_sun and the ratio of H in each star, then find the ratio (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2.

Wait, let me try this.

For Star_1:

(n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun.

For Star_2:

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun.

So, the ratio (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun ] / [ (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ]

Simplify: 10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun ) / [ (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_2 ) ]

Wait, wait,

Wait, more correctly:

(n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 = [10^0.3 (n_Si)_sun ] / [ (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ]

Which is equal to [10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun * 10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun ] / [ (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_2 ) ]

Which simplifies to (10^0.6) * (n_H)_sun / (n_H)_2.

So, ratio = 10^(0.6) * (n_H)_sun / (n_H)_2.

Hmm, but without knowing (n_H)_2, we can't compute this ratio. Wait, but perhaps the stars' H abundances can be determined from their given data.

Wait, but the only data given about Star_2 is [Mg/H]=0, which means n_Mg/n_H)_2 = same as Sun. But n_Mg)_2 = same as Sun's n_Mg?

Wait, no, because [Mg/H] is the logarithm of (n_Mg/n_H)_star - (n_Mg/n_H)_sun. So if it's 0, then (n_Mg/n_H)_2 equals Sun's.

So n_Mg)_2 = (n_Mg)_sun * n_H)_2 / n_H)_sun.

But how does that help?

Wait, but perhaps we can find the ratio (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun and (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun from other data.

Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0. So, n_Fe)_1 /n_H)_1 = same as Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg)_2 /n_H)_2 = same as Sun.

But how about (n_H)_1 and (n_H)_2?

Wait, perhaps the stars' masses don't affect the relative abundances. Because elemental abundances are about the composition, not the number of particles. So perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. Hmm.

Wait, but without knowing the H abundance, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H abundance differences. Or perhaps we can find the ratio via other means.

Alternative approach:

We can compute the ratio (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2.

We have:

(n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But (n_Mg)_2 = (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun.

So,

(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = [ (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun ] / (n_Si)_2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun is (n_Mg)_sun / (n_Si)_sun.

So,

(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = [ (n_Mg)_sun / (n_Si)_sun ) * (n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun ) ].

Set equal to 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun → 

[ (n_Mg)_sun / (n_Si)_sun ) * (n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun ) ] = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Cancel (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun from both sides:

(n_H)_2 / (n_H)_sun ) = 10^0.3.

So, (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun.

So, (n_H)_2 is higher than the Sun's by 10^0.3, which is about 2.

Now, back to the ratio (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2.

Earlier, we had:

(n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 = 10^0.6 * (n_H)_sun/(n_H)_2.

We found (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun → substituting,

(n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 =10^0.6 * (n_H)_sun/(10^0.3 (n_H)_sun) =10^0.6 /10^0.3 = 10^(0.3) ≈ 2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, because 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, the ratio is about 2. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~1.2. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Wait, (n_Si)_1 is 10^0.3 times the Sun's.

(n_Si)_2 is (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

But from earlier, (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun.

So,

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun / 10^0.3 * (10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun ) / (n_H)_sun )

Simplify:

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 *10^0.3 = (n_Si)_sun.

So, (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun.

Wait, what? That can't be right. Because earlier, we thought (n_Si)_2 was (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

But if (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun, then (n_Si)_2 becomes (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (10^0.3) → (n_Si)_sun.

So, (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun.

Wait, that would mean (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 = 10^0.3 / 1 = ~2, which is about 2. But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, B ~12.6, C ~0.8, D ~1.2.

Hmm, but wait maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me re-express.

Wait, maybe I confused [X/Y] notation.

Wait, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]=0.3.

So log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun =0.3 → n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Also, [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun =0 → n_Fe/n_H)_1 = same as Sun.

So, n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

So,

n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_Fe)_1/(n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Which is (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun =0.3 → n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(n_Mg/n_H)_2 - log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun=0 →n_Mg/n_H)_2 = same as Sun.

n_Mg)_2 = (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

So,

n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = [ (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ] / (n_Si)_2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun.

So,

[ (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun ) * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ] =10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Divide both sides by (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun:

(n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) =10^0.3.

So, (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun.

Now, back to Star_1's (n_Si)_1.

(n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_Fe)_1/(n_Fe)_sun *10^0.3.

But (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

So,

(n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * [ (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun ) / (n_Fe)_sun ) ] *10^0.3.

Simplify: (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun *10^0.3.

So,

(n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun *10^0.3.

But we have (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun → (n_H)_sun = (n_H)_2 /10^0.3.

So, (n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/( (n_H)_2 /10^0.3 ) ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

(n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1 * 10^0.3 / (n_H)_2 ) *10^0.3.

Which is (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1 *10^0.6 / (n_H)_2.

But wait, what about (n_H)_1? I don't have data about Star_1's H abundance beyond [Fe/H]=0.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which implies (n_Fe)_1/(n_H)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun/(n_H)_sun → (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

But without knowing (n_H)_1, maybe I can relate it to Star_2's H.

Wait, but I don't think the problem gives any information about (n_H) in the stars except relative to the Sun. So perhaps the H abundance is the same in all stars? No, that's not correct, because each star can have different overall abundances.

Wait, but in the absence of data, perhaps H is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Wait, but that can't be, because Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, meaning Mg in Star_2 is same as in Sun, but H could be same or different.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the H abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that's an assumption and might not be correct, but perhaps it's the only way to proceed.

If (n_H)_1 = (n_H)_sun and (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 (n_H)_sun.

Then,

(n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun *10^0.3.

= (n_Si)_sun * 1 *10^0.3.

= 10^0.3 (n_Si)_sun.

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

But (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 (n_H)_sun → (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun =10^0.3.

So,

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 *10^0.3 = (n_Si)_sun.

Thus, (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 / 1 ≈ 2.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2.

Hmm, so either my approach is wrong, or I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the masses of the stars. Wait, the stars' masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. Hmm, but how does that affect elemental abundances?

Wait, unless the question is about the number of silicon atoms per unit mass or something else. Wait, but the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres," which should be number density, not abundance. But perhaps the total number of silicon atoms depends on the star's size or other factors.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the problem again.

We need to find (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2.

From the Sun's data, n_Fe/n_H is 10^(-4.5), nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

We have:

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → n_Si/n_Fe)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

[Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe/n_H)_1 = same as Sun.

So, n_Si)_1 = n_Si/sun * (n_Fe)_1/(n_Fe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

So,

n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun *10^0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → n_Mg/n_Si)_2=10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg/n_H)_2 = same as Sun.

So, n_Mg)_2 = (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

Then,

n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = [ (n_Mg)_sun * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ] / n_Si)_2.

But (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun.

So,

[n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun) * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) ] =10^0.3 * (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun).

Cancel (n_Mg)_sun/(n_Si)_sun from both sides:

(n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun )=10^0.3.

So, (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 * (n_H)_sun.

Now, I have (n_Si)_1 = (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun *10^0.3.

But I don't know (n_H)_1. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which is (n_Fe)_1/(n_H)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun/(n_H)_sun.

So, (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

But from the Sun's data:

n_Fe)_sun = (n_Fe)_sun =10^(-4.5) * n_H)_sun.

Similarly, (n_Si)_sun = 10^x * n_H)_sun, but I don't know x. Let me compute that.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is (n_Fe/n_H)_sun =10^(-4.5), as we computed earlier.

Wait, but perhaps we can find (n_Si)_sun in terms of (n_Fe)_sun.

Wait, but without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], which would be [Si/Fe]_sun = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But we don't have that directly. Hmm. So perhaps I can express (n_Si)_sun in terms of (n_Fe)_sun and [Si/Fe]_sun.

But without [Si/Fe]_sun, I can't proceed. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expresses the photospheric composition in terms of the Sun's, so maybe I can find the ratios using only the given data and the Sun's composition.

Wait, let me think about the problem again.

We need to find (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2.

We have:

For Star_1: (n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun * (n_Fe)_1/(n_Fe)_sun.

But (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

So,

(n_Si)_1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

For Star_2: (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 * (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun.

But (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 (n_H)_sun.

So,

(n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun /10^0.3 *10^0.3 = (n_Si)_sun.

So, (n_Si)_2 = (n_Si)_sun.

Then, (n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 = (10^0.3 (n_Si)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun ) / (n_Si)_sun ) → 10^0.3 * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

But what is (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun?

Wait, perhaps the star's [Fe/H] is 0, which means (n_Fe)_1/(n_H)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun/(n_H)_sun.

But (n_Fe)_sun =10^(-4.5) n_H)_sun.

So, (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun ) → (n_Fe)_1 =10^(-4.5) n_H)_sun * (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun ) =10^(-4.5) (n_H)_1.

But from Star_1's [Fe/H]=0, (n_Fe)_1 =10^(-4.5) (n_H)_1.

I'm not sure if that helps us find (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that the ratio of H in Star_1 to Sun is the same as the ratio of H in Star_2 to Sun, but that's an assumption.

Wait, perhaps I can set (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun) = (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun) = K.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, from Star_2, we found that (n_H)_2 =10^0.3 (n_H)_sun.

So, (n_H)_2/(n_H)_sun ) =10^0.3.

If (n_H)_1/(n_H)_sun) is also 10^0.3, then:

(n_Si)_1/(n_Si)_2 =10^0.3 *10^0.3 =10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is about 4. So, the ratio is ~4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Hmm, that's one of the options. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the logarithmic abundance ratios provided. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: This implies  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{Star_1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
  \]
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This means  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Star_1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
  \]
  Therefore,  
  \[
  n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Star_1}} = n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
  \]
- Combining these,  
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_1}} = n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
  \]

### Star_2
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: This implies  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Star_2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
  \]
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This means  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Star_2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{Sun}}.
  \]
  Therefore,  
  \[
  n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Star_2}} = n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
  \]
- Combining these,  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Star_2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
  \]
  Setting this equal to \(10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{Sun}}\), we find  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} = 10^{0.3}.
  \]
  Thus,  
  \[
  n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}.
  \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms
For Star_2,  
\[
n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{10^{0.3}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
\]
Substituting \(n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}\),  
\[
n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_2}} = n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}.
\]

For Star_1,  
\[
n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_1}} = n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
\]

The ratio of silicon atoms is  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}.
\]

Assuming \(n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_1}} / n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Star_2}} / n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = 10^{0.3}\),  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Star_2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
