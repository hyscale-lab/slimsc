Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting from trans-cinnamaldehyde, and we need to find out the number of carbon atoms in the final product, product 3.

First, I think I should write down the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. Wait, propenal is CH₂=CHCHO, but wait, no, wait. No, trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So it's benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group? No, wait: trans-cinnamaldehyde is the trans isomer of cinnamaldehyde. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a double bond. Specifically, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. No, the cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is incorrect. Oh, no, wait, I think it's Ph-CH₂-CHO. No, wait, no, I'm confusing things. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, so the structure is a benzene ring with a CH₂CH₂CHO group attached. Wait
