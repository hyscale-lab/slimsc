Okay, I need to find out by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. Hmm, all the planets have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios between the planets. Also, their albedos are the same as Earth's, which is 0.3. 

So, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance. Wait, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature should be proportional to sqrt( (1 - a) ) / D^(1/2). But since the albedo is the same for all, (1 - a) is the same, so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). 

Wait, no, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)} * (1 - a)^(1/4), where T_star is the star's temperature and R_star its radius. But since all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same, so T is proportional to (1 - a)^(1/4) / sqrt(D). But since a is same for all, we can ignore that factor. So, T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), which implies that D is proportional to T^(-2). Or D = k * T^(-2), where k is a constant.

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is given by:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² σ D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Since L, a, σ are constants for each system, T_eq is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2) * (1)^(1/4) (since (
