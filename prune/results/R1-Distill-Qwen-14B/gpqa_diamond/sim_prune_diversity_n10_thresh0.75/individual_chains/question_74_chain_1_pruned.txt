Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over a given time. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the atom has a 32% chance to decay in 100 minutes.

Wait, but they're asking about the next 150 minutes, and 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the total time we're considering is 150 minutes, but 50 have already gone by. So, the remaining time is 100 minutes. Oh wait, wait a second. Let me think again.

Wait no, the initial 100 minutes is the time frame for the 32% probability. So, if 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed, then the remaining time is 50 minutes more to reach 100. Or wait, no, the time we are considering now is 150 minutes from the current point, but the initial 32% was for 100 minutes. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should model it using the decay equation. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus has not decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The decay probability is 1 - P(t).

But the given probability is 32% (0.32) within
