Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. What's the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution, and what's the pH of the resulting solution?

The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume. Hmm.

First, I think I need to find out how to dissolve Fe(OH)3. Since it's a hydroxide, using an acid makes sense because it will neutralize the hydroxide. So, maybe a reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So when you add a strong acid, like HCl, it should react to form Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl^- ions.

The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, right, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each gives an OH- ion, so the acid would donate three H+ per Fe(OH)3.

So first, I need to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let's find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let me compute that. Wait, 0.1 divided by 106.88 is approximately 9.357e-4, which is 0.0009357 moles.

Now, the reaction requires 3 H+ ions per mole of Fe(OH)3. So moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

The acid used is 0.1 M HCl, which is monobasic, so each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. But wait, wait, no: HCl is monobasic, so it donates one H+ per molecule. Wait, no, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Wait, but in the reaction, each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+ ions. So for 0.0009357 moles of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.0028071 moles of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M HCl, so the volume needed is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.0028071 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028071 liters, which is 28.071 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't exactly have 28.07. Let me look at the options.

Option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough. But wait, is that the minimum volume? Because maybe the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³, so the acid is added to the solution, bringing the total to 100 cm³. Wait no, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the 100 cm³ includes the acid and the solution.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So the amount of acid solution is added to the Fe(OH)3 to make the total volume 100 cm³.

Wait, but I think the way to approach this is that the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and after dissolving, the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution is 10
