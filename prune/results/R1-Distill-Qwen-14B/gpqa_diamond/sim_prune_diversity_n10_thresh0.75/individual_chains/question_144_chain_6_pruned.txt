Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles, so they decay pretty quickly. The problem gives me some numbers: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters range, so it's going to involve some small numbers.

Wait, mean decay distance. I think that's related to how far the particle travels before it decays. The mean lifetime would be the average time it exists, and then distance is velocity multiplied by time. But how do I find the lifetime?

Oh right, the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ. I remember that for unstable particles, the natural linewidth is Γ, and the lifetime is given by the uncertainty principle. So the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE is the energy uncertainty, which here is the width Γ, and Δt is the lifetime. So tau ≈ ħ / (Γ). But wait, isn't it ħ/(2Γ) or something? Or maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right. So the lifetime is Planck's constant over (2π times Γ) maybe? Wait, no, I think the relation is Γ = ħ * (1/tau). Or is Γ the full width, so Γ = ħ / tau. Let me check the units. Γ is in MeV, ħ is in GeV·s. So 1 GeV = 1e3 MeV.

Wait, let's make sure. Let me recall the formula. The mean lifetime tau is related to the width Γ. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. Hmm, but sometimes I see it expressed as tau = ħ / (2π Γ) or something else. Maybe I'm mixing up the natural line width formula with the Breit-Wigner distribution. Oh, right, the Breit-Wigner formula says the width Γ is related to the lifetime as Γ = ħ / tau. So I think that's correct.

So first, calculate tau. Then, find the velocity of the meson. Once I have tau and velocity, multiply them to get the average decay distance.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? The meson is produced with some energy, but the mass is given. So maybe I can find the momentum, then velocity from momentum and mass.

The production energy E_X is 8 GeV. So this is the total energy of the meson. The mass is 1.2 GeV, so the rest mass energy is 1.2 GeV. The kinetic energy plus rest energy equals total energy. So the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E_X - m_X c². Since we're
