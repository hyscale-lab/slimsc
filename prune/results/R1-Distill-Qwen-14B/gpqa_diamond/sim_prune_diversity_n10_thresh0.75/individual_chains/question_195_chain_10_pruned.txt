Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. 

We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. This second planet also has a circular orbit, same orbital plane, and should exhibit both transit and occultation events.

Hmm. So, both transiting and occultation events. Wait, what's the difference between them? Oh right, a transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, but since planets are usually much dimmer, it's harder to detect. But for the purpose of this problem, I think the key is that both events must occur. So, the second planet must be in an orbit such that it transits (passes in front) and is occulted (passes behind) the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, but for a planet to transit, it must lie along the line of sight between us and the star. But for it to also be occulted, the planet must also pass behind the star. That probably means that the two planets are in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods are such that the second planet's position is sometimes behind the star relative to us.

But wait, how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to that of the first? The problem is asking for the maximum possible period of the second planet. So we're looking for the largest possible period (longest orbital period) where both transit and occultation events can still occur.

I think this relates to the concept of orbital resonance or maybe the Hill sphere, but perhaps more about the distance from the star. Wait, but the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. Using Kepler's third law, the period is related to the semi-major axis.

Let me think. The orbital period of the first planet is
