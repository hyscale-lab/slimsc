Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let's see what's given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So maybe this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Oh, wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with CN-, it adds to the carbonyl, right? So the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen attacks the nucleophile, the CN-, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product would have both an alcohol (from the protonation of the oxygen) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. That makes sense.

So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. For that, the conditions are usually aqueous acid because the formation of the cyanohydrin involves protonation steps. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a good nucleophile, but in acidic conditions, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic. So, the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. But for cyanohydrin formation, I think you typically use an acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ as a catalyst. So A is probably H3O+.

So the first part of the reaction would choose either options A or B for reagent A.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. And when reagent B (H2O) is added, it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, looking at the structure, the nitrile group (-CN) is converting into a carboxylic acid (-CO
