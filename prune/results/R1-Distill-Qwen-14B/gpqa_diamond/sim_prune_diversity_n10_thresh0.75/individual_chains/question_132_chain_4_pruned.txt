Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, but both compounds have the same molecular formula C10H14. Let me check the molecular formulas of the options to make sure.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: Benzene has 6 carbons, four methyl groups add 4*1=4, so total is 10. 6+4=10. Hydrogen: benzene is 6 H, each methyl is 3 H. So 6 +4*3 =6+12=18 H. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, wait, tetramethylbenzene would be C6H5(CH3)4. So the benzene is C6H6, adding four CH3 groups. So each CH3 contributes 3 H. So 6 H (benzene) + 4*(3 H) =6+12=18 H. But the formula is C10H14. So that's not matching. Wait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecular formula given is C10H14. So let's see each option's actual formula.

Option 1: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Benzene is C6H6. Four methyl groups add 4*(CH3) → so C6 +4C = C10. H: 6 (from benzene) +4*3 (from CH3) → 6+12=18. So formula C10H18. But the problem says C10H14. So that can't be an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, maybe the compounds aren't all substituted with methyl groups. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, same issue as before. Both would have C10H18. But the problem says C10H14. So maybe I've made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps those are not tetramethyl but something else? Or maybe they're diethyl? Wait, option D is 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl, which would both be C10H18.

Wait, but the problem states that the compounds have the formula C10H14. So perhaps the structures have fewer substitu
