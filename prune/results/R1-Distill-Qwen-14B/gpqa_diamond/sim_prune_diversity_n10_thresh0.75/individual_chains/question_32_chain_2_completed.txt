Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So if it's Li-6? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Wait, no, wait: Li has atomic number 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's 3 protons +3 neutrons, so mass number 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

So the problem is about finding the total energy of the ion when it's moving at 0.96c. Right, relativistic energy. So I remember that the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

But wait, the energy given in the options is in GeV, so I need to know the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c² maybe a bit more. Let me get exact numbers. Wait, I think the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So I can calculate the total mass of ^6Li.

So ^6Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass m = 3*(m_p + m_n). Wait, no, each proton and neutron is m_p and m_n respectively. So:

m = 3 * m_p + 3 * m_n.

But wait, protons and neutrons are nucleons, each roughly about 938 MeV. So 3+3=6 nucleons.

Calculating m: 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565). Let me compute that.

3*938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3*939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total m = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. Wait, 5633.511 MeV/c² is the rest mass. But since the problem uses GeV, I should convert this to GeV. 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 5633.511 MeV is 5.633511 GeV.

Now, the speed v is 0.96c. So I need to calculate gamma. The formula for gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, let me double-check: 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. Yep, right. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². But wait, m is already in units where c² is accounted for (since m is in GeV/c², so when multiplied by c², we get GeV). So E = gamma * m.

m is 5.633511 GeV/c². So E = 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.633511.

Breaking it down:

3 * 5.633511 = 16.900533.

0.5714 *5.633511: 0.5*5.633511 is 2.8167555, 0.0714*5.633511 is about 0.4048. So total 2.8167555 + 0.4048 ≈ 3.2215.

So 16.9005 + 3.2215≈20.122 GeV.

Wait, but more accurately, perhaps I should do it with exact numbers.

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.633511.

3.57142857 is exactly 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 25/7 * 5.633511 = (25 *5.633511)/7.

25 *5.633511 = 140.837775.

Divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 ≈20.119682 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.1197 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps my calculation of the mass was a bit off. Let me recheck the mass calculation.

Each proton is 938.272 MeV, each neutron is 939.565 MeV. So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV. 3 neutrons: 3*939.565=2818.695 MeV. Sum is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of ^6Li is not exactly 6 times the average nucleon mass. Because the binding energy of the nucleus is not zero. That is, the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons. Oh wait, that's right! Because when nucleons bind, the mass decreases due to the mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²). So the actual mass of ^6Li is less than 6 nucleon masses.

Hmm, so I have to account for that. Oh, this complicates things. My initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider the binding energy. So how much is the binding energy for ^6Li?

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact binding energy of ^6Li, but perhaps I can get the mass of ^6Li from standard tables. Alternatively, I can compute it based on the atomic mass.

Wait, the mass of ^6Li isotope can be found in the periodic table. Let me think, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. But ^6Li is a specific isotope. Let me find the mass of ^6Li.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the atomic mass of ^6Li. I remember that the mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, that would make sense. But wait, earlier calculation gave me 5.633 GeV without considering the binding energy.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. The mass of ^6Li is about 5.645 GeV/c². Because the sum of the protons and neutrons is 6 * ~938.5 MeV, which is about 5631 MeV. But because of binding energy, the actual mass is less. So for example, for ^6Li, the mass is about 5633 MeV minus binding energy.

Wait, maybe I should compute the actual rest mass using the known isotope mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of ^6Li from standard data. Let me think. The atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, if that's the case, then my earlier calculation was incorrect because I didn't subtract the binding energy.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of the binding energy (E=mc²). So I can't just sum up the masses of protons and neutrons; I have to use the actual nuclear mass.

So to get the correct rest mass m, I need to look up the actual mass of ^6Li. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the sum without considering the binding energy. Hmm, but in that case, the initial approach would give about 20.1 GeV. But let's see the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close to my initial calculation. But the correct approach would require the actual mass, which I might not remember exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy and use the sum of protons and neutrons. Because in many problems, especially at the introductory level, the binding energy is neglected for simplicity.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, the rest mass is the actual nuclear mass, so it's more accurate. So perhaps I should proceed with the actual mass of ^6Li.

So I need the exact mass of ^6Li. Let me think: the atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, how precise is that? Because another source I have in mind says the mass is about 5.645 GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps to get a more precise value, I can compute it using the mass defect. The mass of ^6Li is:

Number of protons: 3. Each has mass 938.272 MeV/c².

Number of neutrons: 3. Each about 939.565 MeV/c².

Total mass without binding: 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) = 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

Then, the actual mass is less than that. The binding energy is the difference. The binding energy per nucleus for ^6Li: I think it's about 5.633 MeV. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact mass of ^6Li.

Wait, from standard data, the mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV. Wait, no, that's too high. Let me think, 5.645 GeV is 5645 MeV. The sum of nucleon masses is 5633.5 MeV. So if the actual mass is 5645 MeV, that would imply a negative binding energy, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the numbers wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the numbers confused. Let me double-check:

The sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

The actual mass of ^6Li is less than this because some mass is converted into binding energy.

Wait, but wait, the mass of ^6Li is about 5.645 GeV/c²? That would be 5645 MeV. But 5645 MeV is more than 5633.5 MeV. That can't be. Because binding energy would cause the actual mass to be less than the sum. So I must be making a mistake.

Ah! Wait, correct me: the rest mass of ^6Li is actually 5.645 GeV/c²? Or is that the total energy? No, wait the rest mass would be in GeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should find the actual mass. Let me think, the mass of ^6Li isotope is about 5.645 GeV/c². Let me think: 1 u (atomic mass unit) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of ^6Li is 6 u * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

Wait, but wait, Li-6 has a mass of approximately 5589 MeV/c²? Because 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV.

But wait, no, because that's the approximate mass using the atomic mass unit. But the exact value would be more precise. Let me think, the exact mass of ^6Li is about 5645 MeV/c²? No, because 6 *931.5 is 5589. So perhaps 5645 would be higher than that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the rest mass is 5.633 GeV, and see if the answer matches any of the options.

Wait, but the initial calculation gave about 20.12 GeV, and option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let me recompute the gamma factor.

Given v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m.

If m is 5.6335 GeV, then E = 3.5714 *5.6335 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.6335.

3 *5.6335 = 16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6335.

Compute 0.5 *5.6335 = 2.81675.

0.0714 *5.6335 ≈ 0.4048.

Adding 2.81675 + 0.4048 ≈3.22155.

So total E ≈16.9005 +3.22155 ≈20.122 GeV.

So approximately 20.122 GeV. Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is slightly higher, leading to a higher energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass is 5.645 GeV/c². Let me compute E with that.

E = 3.5714 *5.645 ≈ ?

3 *5.645 =16.935.

0.5714 *5.645.

0.5 *5.645 =2.8225.

0.0714 *5.645≈0.4047.

Total 2.8225 +0.4047 =3.2272.

So E ≈16.935 +3.2272=20.1622 GeV.

But that's 20.162 GeV, which isn't an option. The options are 18.475,23.069,20.132,21.419.

Hmm. Wait, maybe the speed is 0.96c, and perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Wait, correct. So no mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass should be calculated using more accurate values for protons and neutrons.

Proton mass: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: m_n = 939.565 MeV/c².

So m = 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV =5.633511 GeV.

So using that, E =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that exactly:

3.57142857 is exactly 25/7. So 25/7 *5.633511 = (25 *5.633511)/7.

25 *5.633511 = 140.837775.

Divide by 7: 140.837775 /7 =20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV. Rounding to four decimal places: 20.1197 GeV.

But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of ^6Li is higher. Let me think, if the actual mass is 5.645 GeV/c², then:

E = 3.5714 *5.645= let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.645 = ?

Breaking it down:

3 *5.645 =16.935.

0.5714 *5.645.

Compute 0.5 *5.645=2.8225.

0.0714 *5.645≈0.4048.

Total 2.8225 +0.4048 =3.2273.

So total E=16.935 +3.2273=20.1623 GeV.

But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the calculation without considering the binding energy, so the mass is 5.6335 GeV, leading to E=20.12 GeV, which rounds to 20.122 GeV. But the options have 20.132 GeV as option C. Close, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v =0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly.

Wait, because 0.28 *0.28 =0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857142857...

So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of the mass is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so ^6Li.

But wait, lithium-6 is ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

The atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, but that's the same as the sum I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass.

Wait, according to data, the mass of ^6Li is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, but earlier when I summed the protons and neutrons, I got 5.633 GeV, which is less than 5.645. That can't be right because the actual mass of the nucleus should be less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait a second. 3 protons: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c² each. 3 neutrons: m_n =939.565 MeV/c² each.

So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV. Which is 5.633511 GeV.

But the actual mass of ^6Li is about 5645 MeV/c², which is higher. Hmm, that can't be right because the binding energy should result in a lower mass.

Wait, no! Binding energy is the energy released when the nucleus forms, so the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its parts. So, if the sum is 5633.511 MeV, the actual mass should be less, not more.

So perhaps I'm getting the actual mass wrong. Let me see: the accurate mass of ^6Li is about 5645 MeV/c²? No, that can't be. Because that's higher than the sum.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing g/mol with MeV/c².

Wait, the atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.94 g/mol, but that's in grams per mole. To find the mass in MeV/c², I should use the conversion 1 u ≈931.5 MeV/c².

So mass of ^6Li in MeV/c²: 6.94 g/mol * (1 mol / (6.022e23 atoms)) * (1 u = 931.5 MeV/c²) * (1 u =1.6605e-27 kg).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, the molar mass of ^6Li is 6.94 g/mol = 0.00694 kg/mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So the mass of one ^6Li atom is 0.00694 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈1.152e-26 kg per atom.

Then, using E=mc², the rest energy is m c².

c ≈3e8 m/s.

So E = 1.152e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 =1.152e-26 *9e16 =1.0368e-9 Joules.

Convert Joules to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E =1.0368e-9 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈6.47e9 eV =6470 MeV =6.47 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because 6.47 GeV is way higher than what I thought earlier. But wait, that's because the calculation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute:

Mass of ^6Li isotope: Molar mass is 6.94 g/mol.

Wait, no, ^6Li has an atomic weight of about 6.94 g/mol. So the molar mass is 6.94 g/mol.

So per mole, the mass is 6.94 grams.

Number of atoms per mole: Avogadro's number, 6.022e23.

So mass per atom: 6.94e-3 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = (6.94e-3)/(6.022e23) kg/atom ≈1.152e-26 kg/atom.

Now, E = mc² =1.152e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =1.152e-26 *9e16 =1.0368e-9 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so 1.0368e-9 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈6.47e9 eV =6.47 GeV.

Wait, that's about 6.47 GeV/c². That's the rest mass, which can't be right because that's way higher than the sum of protons and neutrons. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the molar mass with the atomic mass. Another approach: each ^6Li atom has a mass of approximately 6.94 u. So 6.94 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.94 *931.5 ≈6471 MeV ≈6.47 GeV.

But that's impossible because the sum of the protons and neutrons is about 5.63 GeV, as calculated earlier. So this is a contradiction. This means that my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the error is in understanding the mass of the isotope. Maybe the molar mass is not the same as the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic mass is the mass of a single atom, including electrons.

Ah, right! The molar mass includes electrons, but the mass of the nucleus is less. So to find the mass of the ^6Li nucleus, I should subtract the mass of the electrons.

Each Li atom has 3 electrons. So the mass of the electrons is 3*(electron mass).

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c².

So 3 electrons: 3 *0.511 =1.533 MeV.

So the nucleus mass is approximately (6.94 u - 3 * electron mass in u).

Wait, 1 u is about 1.6605e-27 kg.

Electron mass in kg: ~9.109e-31 kg. So in u, that's 9.109e-31 kg /1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈5.48e-4 u.

So 3 electrons: 3 *5.48e-4 ≈0.001645 u.

So the mass of ^6Li nucleus is approximately 6.94 u -0.001645 u =6.938355 u.

Now, converting to MeV/c²: 6.938355 u *931.5 MeV/u ≈6.938355 *931.5 ≈6463 MeV ≈6.463 GeV.

Wait, that's about 6.463 GeV, which is higher than the sum of protons and neutrons, which was 5.633 GeV. That's impossible because the nucleus should have less mass than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy.

This is getting really confusing. Maybe I should use the fact that the mass of ^6Li nucleus is about 5.645 GeV/c². Wait, where did I get that number from? I think I saw somewhere that for ^6Li, the mass is approximately 5.645 GeV/c². But when I calculated using the molar mass, I got around 6.46 GeV, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me think: the mass of the ^6Li nucleus is 6.94 u minus 3 electrons.

But 6.94 u is the atomic mass, which includes electrons. So the nuclear mass is 6.94 u - 3*(electron mass in u).

Electron mass in u: 0.00054858 u per electron.

So 3 electrons: 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass =6.94 -0.00164574 =6.938354 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 6.938354 *931.5 ≈6.938354 *900=6244.5, 6.938354 *31.5=218.35, total ≈6462.85 MeV ≈6.46285 GeV.

Which is about 6.463 GeV.

But earlier, when I summed the protons and neutrons without binding, I got 5.633 GeV. So the nucleus's mass is higher than the sum of the individual nucleons. That can't be possible. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, no, that's not possible. The binding energy should make the nucleus's mass less than the sum of the nucleons. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the atomic mass includes the electrons, so the nuclear mass is less than the atomic mass. Wait, the atomic mass includes electrons, so the nuclear mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

So, for ^6Li, the atomic mass is about 6.94 u.

Electron mass for 3 electrons:3 *0.00054858 u =0.00164574 u.

So nuclear mass is 6.94 -0.00164574 =6.938354 u.

But that's 6.938354 u *931.5 MeV/u =6463 MeV ≈6.463 GeV.

But if the sum of the protons and neutrons is 5.633 GeV, how can the nucleus be 6.463 GeV? That's not possible.

Ah! I see the mistake now. The sum of the protons and neutrons includes their rest masses, but the actual nuclear mass is lower due to binding energy. So the nuclear mass should be less than the sum.

Wait, but according to this calculation, it's higher. So I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the mistake is that the mass of the nucleus includes the binding energy as mass deficit, but when I subtract the electrons, I'm getting a higher value. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I've been misinformed earlier. Let me double-check. The actual mass of the ^6Li nucleus is indeed about 5.645 GeV/c².

Ah! Wait, I think I confused the molar mass with the individual nucleus mass. Each ^6Li atom has a mass of 6.94 u, but the nucleus is 6.94 u minus the electrons. But wait, 6.94 u is the atomic mass, which includes electrons. So the nucleus mass is 6.94 u minus 3 electrons.

Wait, but 3 electrons in u is 0.00164574 u. So 6.94 -0.00164574 =6.938354 u.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/u: 6.938354 *931.5 ≈6462 MeV =6.462 GeV.

But that's higher than the sum of protons and neutrons, which should not be. So this suggests a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the protons and neutrons have their own binding energy. No, that's not right. The protons and neutrons are composite particles, but in the nucleus, the binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together, which reduces the total mass.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the atomic mass, which includes electrons, whereas the sum of the protons and neutrons doesn't include electrons. So the sum of the protons and neutrons is 5.633 GeV, but the nucleus's mass is 5.645 GeV, which is higher. That can't be because of binding energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the rest mass is 5.633 GeV, leading to energy 20.12 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV) when rounded to four decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the ^6Li nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass of ^6Li
The nucleus in question is ^6Li, which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)):

\[
m = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
\]

Convert to GeV:

\[
m = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.5714 \times 5.633511 = 20.1197 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \), which rounds to \( 20.120 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

### Final Answer:
The energy of the RHIC when the speed of the ^6Li nucleus is \( 0.96c \) is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

Answer: C
