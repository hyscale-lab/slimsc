Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Hmm, the scenario is that Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. To get a good image, he needs a super vacuum in the sample compartment—like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around.

He connected vacuum pumps to achieve this, but some gas particles are still there, as detected by the mass spectrometer. So the pressure isn't zero. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under the ultra-high vacuum conditions, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the sample compartment.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, something happens. He notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, which is not the same as λ1. The temperature remains the same, so that shouldn't be the factor.

Wait, okay, what's the mean free path? It's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), or something like that. Wait, another version: λ = (k*T) / (√2 * π * d² * P). Or maybe it's λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P) where P is pressure. Alternatively, the mean free path can be calculated as λ = (1/(√2 * π * n * d²)), where n is the number density. But since pressure and temperature are involved, perhaps we can think in terms of how the mean free path changes when other factors come into play, like electron beam interactions.

So, Mike's initial calculation was λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2. So why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is active?

I think about what the electron beam does. The electrons are moving at high speeds, right? The electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Maybe they cause ionization or some other effect.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, it's possible that the gas molecules are being ionized. So some of the gas molecules become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum chamber—do they behave the same as uncharged ones?

In a vacuum, charged particles (ions) would experience the electric field of the electron beam, or any other fields in the microscope. But in a high vacuum, the mean free path is already long because there are few collisions. But wait, what if the ions are being accelerated or influenced by the beam? Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move or collide more frequently.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to scatter more, thereby reducing the mean free path. But why would that happen?

Wait, when the gas molecules are neutral, their mean free path is determined by their collisions with each other and the chamber walls. But when the gas is ionized, the ions can interact with the beam's electric field, which might cause them to move more, perhaps leading to more frequent collisions or different behavior.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors. The beam can cause ionization, which increases the number of charged particles. If the gas is now partially ionized, the mean free path might change because the ions interact differently with the electrons in the beam.

Wait, but how does the mean free path relate to this? The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and depends on the collision cross-section. If the gas molecules are ionized, their collision cross-section could change. Alternatively, the ionized gas molecules might be more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces, effectively changing the effective pressure or the number density.

Wait another angle: in the initial state (no electron beam), the mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is turned on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The electrons can collide with gas molecules. Each collision would transfer some energy and possibly cause the gas molecules to move more. So, for the gas molecules, their mean free path might be affected by the electrons.

Hmm, but wait, the question says that the mean free path λ2 is different. So what's causing this? Let me think about the physics.

In the presence of a charged particle beam, the gas molecules (which are neutral) might be more likely to ionize because of the high-energy electrons. When a gas molecule is ionized, it becomes an ion. Ions have different behavior in a vacuum.

Ions are influenced by electric fields. The electron beam itself is a moving electric field. So, if the gas molecules are ionized, the ions might experience a force from the beam's electric field, causing them to accelerate or change direction. This could increase the frequency of collisions between the ions and the chamber walls or other ions, thus decreasing the mean free path.

Wait, but how does that change the mean free path? Let's think about how the mean free path is determined. The mean free path depends on the density of the gas and the collision cross-section. If the gas is partially ionized, then the effective density of particles that can collide (like ions) might be lower than the neutral gas density. Or perhaps the cross-section changes.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, it might cause the gas to heat up, but the question states that the temperature remains the same, so that's probably not the factor.

Another possibility is that the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster. If the gas molecules are moving faster, their mean free path would increase because they can travel further before colliding. But wait, the mean free path formula includes the temperature. Since the temperature is the same, the average speed shouldn't change. So that's not it.

Wait, but the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor—maybe the electrons are causing the gas to expand or something. Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-low, and the sample compartment is fixed in volume. So pressure isn't likely to change much.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is for the gas molecules, but when the electron beam is on, the electrons also contribute to collisions. So the gas molecules are now colliding not just with each other and the walls but also with the electrons. So the effective number of collisions increases, which would decrease the mean free path.

But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules. If the electrons are moving through the gas, the gas molecules might collide with the electrons. So the presence of the electrons would effectively increase the number of targets (since the electrons are also moving). So for a gas molecule, the presence of electrons means more possible collision partners, thus reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. If the electron beam introduces a lot of electrons, which are small and moving, the gas molecules would collide more frequently with the electrons, thus reducing λ. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but the problem says that the mean free path changed to λ2 when the electron beam was on. So λ2 is different from λ1. If the presence of the electron beam causes more collisions for the gas molecules, then λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path in the initial state (no beam) is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas molecules might collide with the electrons as well. So the collision cross-section for the gas molecule-electron interaction is different than gas molecule-gas molecule or gas molecule-wall.

But the mean free path is calculated as λ = 1/(nσ√2), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. In the initial state, n is the number density of gas particles, and σ is the cross-section between gas molecules. When the beam is on, the number density of electrons increases, and the cross-section between gas molecules and electrons is different. So the effective n (for gas molecule collisions) becomes higher because now there are more particles (electrons) to collide with.

Wait, but electrons are much lighter and have a much smaller cross-section for collision with gas molecules. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become ionized, leading to more ions which might have a different interaction.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is active, the system isn't just gas molecules and the chamber walls; it's gas molecules, chamber walls, and the electrons in the beam. So the mean free path for the gas molecules is now considering collisions with all these.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it another way. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the diameter of the molecules. But wait, when the electron beam is on, does it affect the pressure? Well, the pressure is already ultra-low. Maybe the beam causes some molecules to be accelerated, leading to a change in effective pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be bombarded, leading to a higher rate of collisions. So the mean free path would be shorter, meaning λ2 < λ1.

So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that's the conclusion.

Wait, but wait another thought. The mean free path for the gas molecules in the presence of the electron beam might be shorter because the electrons are causing more frequent collisions. So the gas molecules collide more with the electrons, making λ2 < λ1.

But another angle: the electron beam's presence could cause the gas to ionize, leading to more ions. Ions have a different way of interacting—perhaps they stick to the walls more, which would effectively reduce the number of gas particles, increasing the mean free path. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and may be accelerated away from the beam or towards it. This movement could cause them to collide more or less frequently.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the process again. The initial mean free path is λ1, calculated when the system is at rest. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, so they're a significant factor. The gas molecules (neutral) could be ionized by the electrons. Once ionized, the ions could experience forces from the beam's electric field, causing them to move, perhaps leading to more frequent collisions.

Wait, but the ions would have a longer mean free path because they're heavier and perhaps move slower. Or maybe not, it depends.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Another point: the electron beam can cause additional scattering. If the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, they might scatter more. So the gas molecules' mean free path would be shorter because they are colliding more frequently with the electrons.

Wait, but the mean free path is for the gas molecules, not the electrons. So the gas molecules could collide with the electrons, but the electrons are moving, so their presence adds more targets for the gas molecules to collide with. So the effective number of targets increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1. So the answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope changes when the electron beam is activated. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr), where the gas molecules interact minimally. However, when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

The mean free path, λ, is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. It depends on factors such as the number density of gas molecules, the collision cross-section, and the temperature. In the initial state (no electron beam), λ1 is calculated based on the gas molecules' interactions with each other and the chamber walls.

When the electron beam is activated, several effects could influence the mean free path:

1. **Ionization of Gas Molecules**: The high-energy electrons in the beam can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized gas molecules (ions) behave differently than neutral molecules, potentially altering their collision dynamics.

2. **Increased Collision Frequency**: The presence of the electron beam introduces additional particles (electrons) into the system. Gas molecules may collide with these electrons, increasing the overall collision rate and effectively reducing the mean free path.

3. **Electrical Effects on Ions**: Ionized gas molecules (ions) can be influenced by the electric field of the electron beam. This could lead to changes in their motion, potentially increasing the frequency of collisions with chamber walls or other particles.

Given that the temperature remains constant, the primary factor affecting λ is the change in collision dynamics due to the electron beam. The beam increases the effective number of collision partners for gas molecules, as they now interact not only with each other and the walls but also with the electrons. This results in a shorter mean free path, meaning λ2 < λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that the mean free path decreases when the electron beam is active.
