Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about electric fields around a charged spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, so the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. But when we place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's charges must redistribute. Oh right, I remember something about induced charges. But the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge must remain zero. So the charges inside the conductor would rearrange to cancel the field inside the conductor material, but what about the cavity?

Oh, right! For a conducting shell with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. But wait, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral initially, so when we put a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor as a whole was uncharged. When we put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge is sum of inner and outer surfaces. So inner is -q, outer is +q, total is zero. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the point P is outside the conductor, so
