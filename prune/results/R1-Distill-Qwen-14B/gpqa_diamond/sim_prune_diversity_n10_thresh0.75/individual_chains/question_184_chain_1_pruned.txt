Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the synthesis of a specific benzene derivative. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw the structure in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me get the numbering correct.

Actually, in IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering starts from the first substituent in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So I think the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering starts at the ethoxy as position 1, then the next substituent is in position 3, but no, the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, 3-nitro. So, the substituents are in the ortho and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, looking at the benzene ring, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent to each other. So
