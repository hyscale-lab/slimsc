Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably figure out what each of these compounds is. The question gives a series of reactions, so maybe I can work backwards or find a common structure.

Let me read the problem again. So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Oh, and D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to identify what each chemical might be.

Starting from the beginning: A reacts with B to form C. The stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B. Also, the product is bright red. Hmm, what compounds are bright red when formed? Maybe something like copper(II) ions are blue, but wait, maybe it's lead dioxide? Or maybe a different reaction.

Wait, another thought: what if B is oxygen gas, O2? If A is a metal, then reacting with O2 could form an oxide. But 8 equivalents... that's a lot. Let's see, if A is something like sulfur... No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is an oxide of a transition metal. Let's think about the reaction with B as another gas. Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak are like CH3COOH, HNO2.

Wait, when C reacts with water, it forms A plus F and G. So C is probably an anhydride. Because when anhydrides react with water, they form acids. So if F is a strong acid and G a weak, then perhaps C is a mixed anhydride.

Wait, but another possibility: C could be a salt that reacts with water to form a metal oxide and acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfite or something else. Hmm, but let
