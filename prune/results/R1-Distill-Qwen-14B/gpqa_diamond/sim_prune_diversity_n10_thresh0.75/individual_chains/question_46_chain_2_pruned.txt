Okay, so I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, the starting material is an alkene, and it'll probably undergo some kind of ring-closing or cross metathesis.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃? Or wait, wait, pent-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH3)-... No, wait, pent has five carbons. So, 1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH(CH3)-? Wait no, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl group is on C3. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, that can't be right because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene: positions 1,2
