Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says that a supernova occurs, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the frames are moving relative to each other. Since the supernova ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center, and in their own frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. So, this is a problem involving relative velocity and perhaps time dilation or length contraction, depending on the situation.

But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution of the Galaxy. So, we can treat this as a simple relative motion problem without considering any gravitational effects or the Galaxy's rotation. So, it's just about relative velocity between two inertial frames.

Wait, but the question is about distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. Let me think about how the frames are moving relative to each other. If the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, that means the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy's center in the Galaxy's frame. Because when you switch frames, the velocities reverse directions but keep the same magnitude if the frames are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.

So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Now, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, but wait a secondâ€”time is different in different frames. So, we might need to account for time dilation.

Wait, but if the frames are inertial, and the velocities are high (60,000 km/s is like 20% of the speed of light), then time dilation would come into play. So, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same. So, if 50 seconds pass in the eject
