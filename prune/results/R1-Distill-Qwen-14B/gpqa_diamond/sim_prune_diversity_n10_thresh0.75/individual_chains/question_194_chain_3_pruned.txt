Okay, so I have this physics problem about partition functions for a system of spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it.

The question says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? And β is 1/(kT), so higher β means lower temperature, but I don't think that detail affects the calculation right now.

Each spin has two possible states, so with three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to calculate E for each of these 8 states and then sum up exp(-βE) for each.

But maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's denote each term as S_i S_j. So each term is either +1 or -1, because each S is either +1 or -1.

Wait, each term S_i S_j will be 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 if they're different. So for three spins, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary. Let me figure out all possible values of this sum.

Let me consider all possible spin configurations.

Case 1: All spins are the same. Let's say all +1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are +1, one is -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, let me check another configuration in this case. Suppose S3=+1, but S2=-1. So S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2= -1, S1S3=1, S2S3= -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Same as before. So each of these cases (two +
