Okay, so I'm faced with this NMR and LC-MS question, and I need to figure out what's going on. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Oh, and the coupling isn't the reason—so spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. I need to find the most likely explanation.

Let me break down the observations. First, the NMR. Normally, in an NMR, each unique proton gives a peak. But here, the same alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Since the integrals add up to 1H, it's like each peak is 1H each but maybe they split each other? Wait, but coupling is ruled out. So why two peaks?

Wait, maybe it's not splitting. Another possibility is that the proton is in a different environment in each case. But how? Maybe the molecule is not entirely pure, or perhaps there are isomers?

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is contamination with a precursor. But then the LC-MS would show two peaks, each with a different mass than the expected. Because the precursor would have a higher mass. But the question says both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected. So A might not be it.

Option B is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same physical properties except for optical activity. NMR can sometimes show different shifts for enantiomers if there's a chiral shift reagent, but in a regular NMR, they might look the same because the environment for each proton is the same. Wait, but if the molecule is in a racemic mixture, would the alpha-proton split into two? No, because enantiomers are mirror images; each proton's environment should be identical. So in that case, the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton. Unless perhaps it's a diastereomer instead. Wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would look different.

Option C is 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. Double coupling could imply some kind of coupling between two protons, but wait, in an amide formation, maybe an intermediate like an activated ester or something. Or perhaps an iminium ion or something that formed a different structure. Hmm, not sure. How would that lead to two peaks in the NMR? Maybe if there's an exchange or something causing the proton to split. But I'm not too familiar with this term 'double coupling'—maybe it's a situation where a proton is coupled with two different protons, but the question says coupling is ruled out.

Option D is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. If there are two diastereomers, each with the same alpha-proton in a different environment, then each would have their own peak. So in the NMR, you would see two peaks for the same proton but different shifts. Wait, but the question says the chemical shifts are similar. Oh, but if the diastereomers have the same or very similar shifts, maybe due to symmetry or similar environments. So maybe the two diastereomers have the same shift for that alpha proton. Or maybe the NMR can't resolve the difference. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals. If the diastereomers are present, each would contribute differently. Wait, but the integral is 1H each, so together 2H? Wait no, the problem says the integrals together are 1H. That's confusing. Wait, each peak would be for the same proton. So, each diastereomer would have one peak for that proton
