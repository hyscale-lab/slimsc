Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups have specific IR absorptions, usually a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1, which would be the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum data. There are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the positions of the substituents will determine the number of distinct aromatic protons. In a 6-membered ring with two substituents, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. Let's think about each case.

- Para substitution: The ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Each substituent is opposite each other, so the H's would be in equivalent positions. So for para, we might expect two signals for the aromatic protons. That matches the two signals given here. So that's a possibility.

- Ortho substitution: The substituents are next to each other. Then the ring would have two types of H's. One substituent would make two adjacent H's, and the other substituent would make another pair. But wait, in ortho, the substituents are adjacent, so perhaps the ring has symmetry. For example, in para-xylene, there are two types. But in ortho, maybe the aromatic protons are split into two groups as well. Hmm, maybe I should consider that.

Wait, if the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be in two sets, each with two equivalent protons. So in the NMR, they would appear as two doublets or something else, depending on the substituents. But the NMR says two signals for aromatic H, so either case could be possible.

But let's move on to the other signals. 

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, so perhaps this is part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring. For example, maybe an ester group with a vinyl substituent.

The ester group is typically R-O-CO-R'. So if one of the substituents is an ester, perhaps the R is a vinyl group. But wait, esters are usually connected via an oxygen. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group with a vinyl chain.

Wait, another possibility: the di-substituted ring could have two ester groups, but that's less likely because the options have O2, so two oxygen atoms. An ester group has two oxygens (O and O in the ester linkage). So, wait, if there are two ester groups, that would be four oxygens, but the formula is O2. So each ester has two oxygens, but if you have two esters, that's four. That can't be. So the compound must have one ester group, which contributes two oxygens
