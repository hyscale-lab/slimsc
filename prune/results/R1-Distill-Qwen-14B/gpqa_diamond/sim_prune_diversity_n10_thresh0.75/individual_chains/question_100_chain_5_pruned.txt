Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. So, what's the structure of that? C3H6 could be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane, but more likely it's propene because cyclopropane is less reactive in typical bromination conditions. Wait, but cyclopropane can also undergo bromination under certain conditions. Hmm, but I think the scenario here is more about adding bromine across a double bond.

So, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Carbon tetrachloride is a solvent, and for brominating alkenes, it's probably using a bromine water solution. When bromine adds to an alkene, it does so across the double bond, leading to dibromide. So, if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3), then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, often causing elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms. So, if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, reacting with KOH (alcohol) would likely lead to an elimination reaction. Since there are two adjacent bromine atoms, the KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, the product C would be propene again, but wait—that can't be right. Wait, no, when you eliminate two bromides, you form a double bond. So if the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane, removing H and Br from adjacent carbons would give back propene, which is C3H6. But wait, propene is the starting material. But wait, could there be another possibility?

Alternatively, if the starting compound A was cyclopropane, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If A is propene: CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give
