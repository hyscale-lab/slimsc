Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules having chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, which makes them non-superimposable mirror images. So, when a molecule has a chiral center, it can exist as enantiomers, which are optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, each bearing a nitro and a methyl ester group. Wait, wait, the ester groups are OMe, right? So, the structure has two ester groups and two nitro groups. Now, can this structure have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion? Let me visualize it. The two rings are connected at position 1, so they're para to each other on the connecting carbon. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions. Since the two rings are symmetric, is there any possibility of chirality? Wait, maybe the biphenyl itself can have a chiral axis. Oh, I think biphenyls can show geometric isomerism if the substituents are in the right positions. Wait, but this is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. In biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could have enantiomers. But wait, this molecule has two nitro groups on the same carbon as the ester? Or no, wait: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each benzene ring has a nitro and a ester group at positions 2 and 6? No, wait, the formula says 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at position 6, and the 2,2' positions have
