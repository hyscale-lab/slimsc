Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through it. Alright, the problem says that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spaceship. The speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really, really close to the speed of light. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, so about 150 years each. The astronaut is 22 years old, and they want to get to Earth. We need to figure out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, so it's a question about time dilation, right? Because when you're moving at such a high speed, time slows down for you relative to someone else. But wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, so that's the proper time. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time observed from Earth or another frame.

First, I think I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't give a specific distance. Hmm, maybe I can assume that the distance is such that at 0.99999987c, the time is significant but manageable. Wait, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So if the ship is going at almost the speed of light, but not exactly, there's still some time involved.

Wait no, the question is from the astronaut's perspective. So the astronaut's own time is the proper time, which is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. The formula for proper time (tau) is the time measured in the moving frame (the ship's frame) is related to the time in the Earth's frame (t) by tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, since the spaceship is moving, the distance is contracted from the perspective of the astronaut.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the distance and speed as seen by the astronaut. So the distance to Earth is contracted. Let me think: the proper distance (from Earth's frame) is L, so the astronaut's frame sees a contracted length L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then the time experienced would
