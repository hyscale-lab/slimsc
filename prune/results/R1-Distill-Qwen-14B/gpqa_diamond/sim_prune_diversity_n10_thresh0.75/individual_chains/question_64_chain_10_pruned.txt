Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through some tubes, and based on the results, I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, the setup involves some reactions and analysis of the products. Let me think about each part.

First, the gases passed through three tubes:

1. Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, but in this context, it probably reacts with moisture. So if the gases are passing through, any water vapor would be absorbed here. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that water was produced. The reaction would be Mg(ClO4)2 absorbing H2O, forming Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. The mass increase is the mass of H2O, right? So 3.60 grams of H2O. Let me calculate moles: 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O.

2. Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. So the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. That implies that the gas wasn't CO2 or another acidic gas that would react with a base. So perhaps the gas was something like NH3, which would react, but if the weight didn't change, maybe it wasn't present. Or maybe the solution was saturated and couldn't absorb more, but that seems less likely.

3. Tube №3: Red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So what reacts with hot copper? Probably CO because CO will react with Cu to form CuO. Let's see: the reaction is 2 Cu + CO → 2 Cu + CO2? No, wait, the more likely reaction is 2 Cu + CO → Cu2O (but that might not be the case if it's red-hot). Alternatively, perhaps 2 Cu + CO → Cu2O + H2? Hmm, no. Wait, wait. When CO is passed over hot copper, it can be oxidized. Wait, the reaction is 2 Cu + CO → Cu2O(s) + H2(g) under certain conditions? No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the reaction as CO reacting with Cu: CO(g) + Cu(s) → CuO(s) + C(s). But I'm not exactly sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + C, but perhaps it's 2 Cu + CO → Cu2O. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2 CuO + CO → Cu2O (but I'm not confident). Maybe I should calculate the moles. The mass increase is 0
