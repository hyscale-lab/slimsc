Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, which is double the elementary charge. Their mass is negligible, so I guess we don't have to worry about kinetic energy from their movement or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate it and pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think this is an electrostatics problem. Since the charges are fixed, the energy in question is the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Because all the charges are identical, and some are fixed, I need to compute the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but potential energy in a system of charges is typically the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Remember, each pair contributes to the total. So, for n charges, the total potential energy would be the sum over all pairs. But wait, some of the charges are fixed and others are moving, but in this case, since they are constrained, I think all interactions contribute to the total.

Wait, no. Wait, twelve charges are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th is fixed, and the others are each 2 meters away from P. So the system consists of 13 charges: one at the center (fixed), and twelve around it, each at a distance of 2 meters.

So the potential energy of the system will be the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the twelve, plus the potential energies between each pair of the twelve charges themselves.

But wait, let me think. The fixed charge is at P, and each of the twelve is at 2m from P. So each of the twelve is at a distance of 2m from the central charge. So the potential energy between the central charge and each surrounding charge is (k * q1 * q2)/r.

But since all charges are identical, each of the twelve is 2e, and the central one is also 2e. So the potential energy for each central-charge pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). There are twelve such
