Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, either ortho, meta, or para relative to themselves.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring connected to different substituents. They all undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. So, the one with the lowest para yield comes first, and the highest comes last.

Let me list out the substituents again:

1) C6H5-CH3 → This is toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → This looks like ethyl benzoate. The carbonyl group (like ester) is deactivating but ortho/para-directing because it's an electron-withdrawing group but still directs via resonance.

Wait, no. Wait, substituents can be either activating or deactivating, which affects the reactivity and the directing effect. Activating groups make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic attack, and deactivating do the opposite.

Methyl group (-CH3) is activating (due to electron-donating by the +I effect) and is ortho/para-directing.

Ester group, like COOEt, is deactivating. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, so it deactivates the ring. But the ester is a meta director? Wait, no. Wait, esters are actually ortho/para directors. Because substituents like carbonyl groups (like in nitro groups) are deactivating but meta directors. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think.

Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta directors. So, esters, which are similar but not as strong deactivating, maybe same? Wait, no. Wait, ester group is an activating group?

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: the substituents can be classified as activating or deactivating.

Electron-donating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -
