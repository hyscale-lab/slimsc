Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let's see. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and the only possible positions for the particles are between x=1 and x=3. Oh right, because when they measured, none were found outside this range. 

Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are only found between 1 and 3, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1, because probabilities must sum to 1.

The wave function is given as ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. So the wave function is a complex number. To find the probability density, I need to compute ψ*(x) ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Its conjugate would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying them together: (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5i)^2? Wait no, wait. Let me actually compute it correctly.

The product ψ*ψ
