Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles in a detector. Alright, the question is about Lorentz factors and how particles reach the detector walls. 

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. 

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I think I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Oh right, because from the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles might have a longer lifetime due to time dilation. So the particles' lifetime is gamma times their proper lifetime.

But wait, how does this relate to the detector's radius? The particles are moving outward from the center. So the time they have to reach the inner walls is determined by how far they can go before decaying. So the distance they travel is velocity multiplied by time. 

Wait, but velocity at ultra-relativistic speeds is approximately the speed of light. So the distance the particle travels is roughly c multiplied by the time it lives. And the time it lives as seen in the lab frame is gamma times the proper time (tau). 

So the maximum distance the particle can travel is gamma * c * tau. But wait, the detector's radius is fixed. So for a particle to reach the wall, gamma * c * tau must be greater than or equal to the radius R.

Wait, so if the original situation is that one third (1/3) reach the wall, and we need to find the gamma that makes two-thirds (2/3) reach. So maybe the original gamma is 20, and with that, only one third make it. 

Wait, but the problem says that the average Lorentz factor is about 20. So gamma is 20. But in that case, one third reach the wall. So perhaps the proper time is such that when gamma is 20, only a third of the particles make it. But if we increase gamma, more would reach the wall.

Alternatively, maybe the decay probability is related to the distance they can travel. Let me think. The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall would depend on the relation between gamma and the detector's radius. 

Hmm, I think the key here is the proper lifetime. The mean lifetime tau is related to the observed lifetime by tau_obs = gamma * tau_rest. So the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma.

The maximum distance the particle can travel is v * tau_obs. Since v is approximately c, it's c * gamma tau.

The detector's radius R is 30 meters. So, for a particle to reach the wall, gamma * tau * c should be equal to R. Wait, but each particle has a certain gamma, and if their gamma is too low, they might decay before reaching the wall.

But wait, the problem says that with gamma ~20, on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So maybe the average gamma is 20, but the actual gammas vary, leading to some particles making it and others not. 

But perhaps a better approach is to model this as a probability. The probability that a particle with gamma reaches the wall is P = 1 - exp(- R/(c gamma tau)) ), since the decay follows an exponential distribution. 

If the particles are produced with a certain gamma, then the probability of decaying before reaching the wall is P_decay = 1 - exp(- R/(c gamma tau) ). The probability of reaching the wall is P_survive = exp(- R/(c gamma tau) ).

Wait, but in the original setup, gamma is 20, and one third (1/3) reach the wall. So, 1/3 = exp( - R/(c gamma tau) )

So, 1/3 = exp( - 30 / (c * 20 * tau) )

Wait,
