Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering can be tricky. Let's see: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So if I number the ring so that the ethoxy is on carbon 1, then moving clockwise, the tert-butyl is on 2 and nitro on 3. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the positions are 1, 2, 3, etc., around it.

Wait, another thought: in benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. So maybe the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. But how does that fit the substituents we're adding?

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the numbering must be such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, in a benzene ring, substituents at 1, 2, and 3—so they must be meta to each other? Wait no—positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, so they are ortho and meta relative to each other. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (adjacent), and nitro at 3 (next to 2 and across from 1). Hmm, that's a bit crowded, but I guess that's the structure we're dealing with.

Now, the starting material is benzene. I need to add these substituents in the correct order and with the right directing groups. Let's think about the directing effects of each substituent.

Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents we add will direct incoming groups to certain positions. Strongly activating groups like -OEt (ethoxy) are strong activating, ortho/para directors. Strongly deactivating groups like nitro are meta directors. But wait, nitro is deactivating and meta directing.

Wait, but when nitro groups are present, they deactivate the ring, making further substitution harder. So we need to plan the order of substitution to avoid issues. Also, the order in which substituents are added can affect the position where the next substituent attaches.

So, the substituents we have are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about the order of adding them. Since nitro is a meta director and deactivates the ring, that's a key consideration.

I think the general strategy is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position with minimal steric hindrance and correct directing.

Let me outline the substituents and their effects:

1. Ethoxy (-OEt): strong activating, ortho/para director.
2. tert-Butyl: bulky, but since t-butyl is an alkyl group, it's a strong activating (but bulky) group, so it's an ortho/para director. However, being bulky, it may prefer para positions when possible because of less steric strain. But in this case, since we're adding it to a certain position, the directing effect is key.
3. Nitro (-NO2): strong deactivating, meta director.

So, if we add the nitro group last, it would be easier because the ring is already substituted with activating groups that can direct it
