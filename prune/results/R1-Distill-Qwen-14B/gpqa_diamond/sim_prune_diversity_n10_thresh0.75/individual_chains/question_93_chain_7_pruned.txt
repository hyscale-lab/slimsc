Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is that a scientist is running a quantitative PCR and has made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency is 100%, R squared is 1, which sounds perfect, and the slope is -3.3.

Looking at his results, the Ct values for each concentration are:

- 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
- 10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
- 1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in his results, and the options are A to D.

First, I'll try to understand each part. So qPCR works by amplifying DNA, and the Ct value is the cycle number at which the fluorescence crosses a certain threshold. A lower Ct means more starting material because it reaches the threshold sooner.

In a perfect scenario with 100% efficiency, each ten-fold dilution should result in an increase of about 3.333 in the Ct value. Because each cycle doubles the DNA, so a ten-fold dilution requires log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles. The slope here is -3.3, which makes sense because the slope in a qPCR standard curve is usually calculated as -3.322 (because of the logarithmic relationship between the dilution and Ct). So that's correct.

Now, looking at the data, let's see how the Ct values change with each ten-fold dilution.

100000 to 10000: 33.9 average is about 34, and 30.6 is roughly 30.9. The difference is about 3.3 cycles. Wait, 34-30.9 is about 3.1. Hmm. Wait, 33.9 (for 1e5) to 30.6 (1e4) is a change of about 3.3, yes. Because 33.9 minus 30.6 is 3.3. Similarly, 30.6 (1e4) to 27.3 (1e3) is 3.3. 27.3 to 24 is 3.3. 24 to 20.7 is 3.3 as well. So each step is a 10-fold dilution and the Ct increases by about 3.3. So the data seems perfect, but the question is why are there discrepancies?

Wait, the question says the results have discrepancies. So looking at the data, each replicate's Ct values are close to each other. For 1e5, the three Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2, right? So the variation between the replicates is about 0.6. Similarly, other concentrations have similar variation. So the technical replicates are close, but maybe the question is about how the Ct values change with concentration.

Wait, but the options are about possible explanations for the discrepancies. Let's look at the options.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. No, because the efficiency is 100% and R squared is 1, so the curve fits perfectly. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target. Hmm, but the data seems to fit perfectly because each dilution step gives a 3.3 increase in Ct. So B suggests that Ct and target don't match. But in reality, they do here. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, wait, his slope is -3.3, which is the expected value for a 10-fold dilution. So ten-fold should be 3.3 cycles. So C is saying that the ten-fold is more than 3.3, which isn't the case. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, each replicate has a deviation of about 0.3-0.6. For example, 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—so the max deviation is 0.6, which is more than 0.3. So D is pointing out that the technical replicates have a larger deviation than 0.3.

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The data looks perfectly linear, so why are there discrepancies? Because each of the technical replicates isn't exactly the same, but that's normal. Or is the question pointing out that the Ct values don't align with the expected 3.3 per ten-fold?

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that when you have a 10-fold dilution, it doesn't change the Ct by exactly 3.3 cycles. But in this case, each dilution does exactly that. So why are the Ct values for each sample not exactly a 3.3 step? They are—30.6 minus 27.3 is 3.3, and so on.

Wait, but what about the actual Ct values? Let me calculate the average of each set:

1e5: (33.9 +34.2 +34.5)/3 = 34.2
1e4: (30.6+30.9+31.2)/3=30.9
1e3: (27.3+27.6+27.9)/3=27.6
1e2: (24+24.3+24.6)/3=24.3
1e1: (20.7+21+21.3)/3=21.0

So the Ct values are: 34.
