Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll do my best.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1. Hmm, when ketones react with bromine... Wait, no, wait. Bromine typically adds across double bonds. Oh wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh right, wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the carbonyl is a ketone. So maybe the bromine is adding to the carbonyl group.

Wait, when ketones react with bromine, I think it's a different kind of reaction. Oh, wait, no. Maybe it's a dihydroxylation? Or is it something else. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. I'm confusing things. Bromine can react with ketones in a different way. Oh right, maybe it's a halogenation via enolate. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing some kind of bromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone; bromine could react via the enol mechanism. Oh, right! The enol form of the ketone can attack bromine. So, in the presence of a base, the ket
