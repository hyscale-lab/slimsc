Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the setup: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving k, q, d, R.

Wait, potential energyâ€”right. When dealing with conductors and charges, the potential energy usually involves the work done in bringing charges together. But since it's a conducting sphere, I remember that it's an equipotential surface, and the charges on it will redistribute. Oh, and because it's grounded, the sphere can have induced charges but also can lose or gain electrons to maintain a neutral charge perhaps.

Wait, when a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move in or out. So, the sphere will have induced charges: the inner surface will have charge -q and the outer surface will have some charge, but since it's grounded, the total charge on the sphere would be zero? Wait, no. Wait, the sphere is neutral to begin with, right? Or does it have an initial charge?

Hmm, the question doesn't say anything about the sphere being initially charged. So I think it's neutral. So when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface, being connected to ground, can lose electrons or gain them. Wait, wait, the conductor's outer surface must be at the same potential as the ground, right? Because it's grounded.

So, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q. To ensure the entire sphere remains neutral (since it's grounded and initially neutral), the outer surface must have a charge +q. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the sphere is neutral, the total charge is zero. The induced charge on the inner surface is -q, so the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. But wait, no, because the sphere is grounded, it can adjust its charge. Hmm, no, the sphere's total charge would be the sum of inner and outer charges. If the inner is -
