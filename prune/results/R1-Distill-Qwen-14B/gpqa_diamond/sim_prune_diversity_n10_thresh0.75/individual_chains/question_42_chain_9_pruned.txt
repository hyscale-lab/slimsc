Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I don't think that's directly relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The problem gives me the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So the temperature of Planet1 is higher than Planet2 by 1.4 times, and Planet3 is even cooler.

Also given are the mass ratios. Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is more massive than Planet3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. How much larger is Planet3's period?

Hmm, I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³, but since the planet masses are usually negligible compared to the star, it simplifies to P² ∝ a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. Wait, no, actually, for a planet orbiting a star, the formula is P² = (4π² G M_star)^-1 * a³ * (M_planet + M_star). But again, M_planet is much smaller, so it's P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

But wait, in this problem, all the planets are orbiting the same star, right? Because they're a system. So M_star is the same for all three. So then, P² is proportional to a³. So the period ratio would be the cube root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the semi-major axes directly. It gives me the equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios. So how do I connect this?

Equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, D is the distance (semi-major axis), and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that cancels out. So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to [ L / D² ]^(1/4), because (1-a) is the same for all.

So the temperature ratio is (L/(D²))^(1/4) for each planet.

Given that, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4.

Which implies that [ (L/(D1²)) / (L/(D2²)) ]^(1/4) = 1.4.

Simplifying the inside: (D2²/D1²)^(1/4) = 1.4.

So (D2/D1)^0.5 = 1.4.

Squaring both sides: D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Wait, but wait. Because T is proportional to (L/D²)^(1/4), so if T1/T2 = 1.4, then ( (D2²)/(D1²) )^(1/4) = 1.4. So (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Wait, but that can't be right because if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, it must be closer to the star. So D1 < D2. So the ratio D2/D1 is 1.96, meaning Planet2 is farther out than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3.

So ( (D3²)/(D2²) )^(1/4) = 2.3.

So (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29.

So D3 is 5.29 times D2.

So combining, D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ let's calculate that.

5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 ≈ 10.3684. So D3 ≈ 10.37 D1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis by Kepler's third law. Since we're assuming the same star for all, the period squared is proportional to a³. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

Wait, wait. Because P² ∝ a³, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(
