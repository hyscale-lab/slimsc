Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's think step by step.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from it. The formula I think is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. But wait, the albedo is the same for both planets, so that part might cancel out.

Wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that term will be the same for both. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the square root of the ratio of (R_star / a) for each planet.

But how do I find the distances a for each planet? Oh, the transit and RV methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass and the distance. Similarly, the transit method gives the radius of the planet and the distance based on the depth of the transit.

Wait, the star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K. The planets' masses and radii are given as well.

The problem gives the Doppler shifts for each planet in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Wait, so the shift is a wavelength shift. So for RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity. But how to relate that to the orbital parameters.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) ) / (4π² a³) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) ) / (M_star)^(1/3) ), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Wait, but I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance. The formula is K = [ (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/( ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.

The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * c) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. I think the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K
