Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. So, the question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required, and also the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, first, I think I need to figure out the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it should produce a salt and water. Since the acid is monobasic, it should donate one H+ ion. So, the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Wait, no, maybe it's different. Oh no, wait, Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so when it reacts with a monobasic acid like HCl, the reaction should be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yes, that makes sense.

So, the next step is to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- group is 17.01 g/mol. Since there are three OH groups, that's 3 * 17.01 = 51.03 g/mol. Adding that to Fe's 55.85 gives 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol for Fe(OH)3.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 0.1 divided by 106.88. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 0.0009357 mol. So about 9.357e-4 moles.

But wait, looking at the reaction, each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Oh, right—because the acid is monobasic, each molecule provides one H+. So, for each Fe(OH)3, we need 3 H+ ions. So, the moles of HCl needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, HCl required = 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Now, the HCl solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So, volume (L) = moles / Molarity. So, 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L =
