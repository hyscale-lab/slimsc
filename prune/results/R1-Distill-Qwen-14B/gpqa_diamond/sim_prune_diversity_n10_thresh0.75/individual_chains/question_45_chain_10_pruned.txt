Okay, so I need to figure out the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the given E is equal to that part without n, so E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is n² * E.

Wait, but wait. There are four particles. Since they're spin-1/2, which is fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold only two particles, right? Because for spin-1/2, the spin can be up or down, so each n can have two particles.

So I need to arrange these four particles in the lowest possible energy states, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about the ground state first. The lowest energy state would have the particles filling the lowest possible orbitals, each with their spins aligned to fit two per orbital.

So, the first state is n=1. Since we can only have two particles here (because of spin), that's two particles. Then the next, n=2, which can also hold two particles. So all four will be in n=1 and n=2?

Wait no. Wait, four particles in total. So two in n=1, two in n=2.

Wait, no. Because each n level can hold two particles (each with opposite spin). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with spin up and down), and the next two go into n=2. So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but since all four are identical, each in their respective states. So each in n=1 contributes E (since E_1 =1² E= E). Each in n=2 contributes E_2=4E. So two particles at n=1 contribute 2*E, and two particles at n=2 contribute 2*4E. So total energy would be 2E + 8E = 10 E. Hmm, but wait, that's the ground state?

Wait, no. Wait, no, because the ground state would actually have the lowest possible configuration. Let me think again
