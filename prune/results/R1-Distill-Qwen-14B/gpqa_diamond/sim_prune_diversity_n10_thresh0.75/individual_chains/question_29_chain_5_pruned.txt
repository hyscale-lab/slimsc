Okay, so I have this question about barley genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate that compound by producing mutants using EMS. Then, when they sequenced the target gene in all mutants, some changes were found in the first exon area.

So the question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D.

First, I need to understand what each mutation does. Let me look at the sequences provided.

The intact gene is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, the first exon area. Let's compare each mutant's sequence to the intact one.

Looking at Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to the intact gene, let's see the differences. The intact gene starts with ATGTTT... Let me break it down.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT …TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC …TGA

Wait, maybe I should split each into codons. Let me align:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT …TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC …TGA

Wait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me see the exact differences.

Let me look position by position.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, I think I should compare each nucleotide. Let me write the first part:

Intact: Position 1-20 (just as an example) is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT …TGA

Mutant1: ATG
