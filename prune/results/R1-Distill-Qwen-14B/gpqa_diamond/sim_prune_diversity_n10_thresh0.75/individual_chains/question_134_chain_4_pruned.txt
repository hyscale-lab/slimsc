Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula usually involves moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact process here.

Looking at the problem, they give me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they should neutralize each other. But here, there are two acids and one base. Oh, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So I think the first step is to figure out how much acid and base I have in terms of moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me break it down.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. The volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) and concentration is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. That means 0.1 mol H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is also a strong acid. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+ because it's diprotic. The volume is 300 mL (
