Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let me think. I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

Wait, the given spin state is (3i, 4). So that's a two-component vector. Let me write that down: ψ = [3i, 4]^T. But wait, before I proceed, I should probably normalize this vector, right? Because the expectation value requires the state to be normalized. Or does it? Hmm, maybe not necessarily because if it's not normalized, the expectation value would just be the average multiplied by the normalization factor squared. Wait, no, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state isn't normalized. Because the expectation value is <A> = (ψ, Aψ) / (ψ, ψ), where ( , ) is the inner product.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are in terms of ħ/2 multiplied by the matrix. Oh wait, right! The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So I have to remember that factor.

So first, let's write down σ_y as given in the question. It's a 2x2 matrix with 0  -i on the first row, and i 0 on the second row. So:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

But wait, the actual spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the electron is in the state ψ = [3i, 4]^T. Let me compute the inner product ψ† σ_y ψ. Wait, but wait, the spin state's components are given as (3i,4), so ψ is a column vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

Wait, but to compute ψ† σ_y ψ, I need to do ψ† multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by ψ. So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3, 4* ]? Wait, wait: ψ is (3i,4), so each component is a complex number. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4 because it's real. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y.

Wait, let's compute that multiplication. Let's break it down.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Multiplying ψ† (which is row vector) with σ_y:

The first element is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ), which is 0 + 4i =4i.

The second element is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ), which is (3i²) + 0. Wait, i squared is -1, so 3i² is 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is (-3i * -i) = (3i^2) = 3*(-1) = -3? Wait, let me re-calculate that.

Wait, ψ† is [ a, b ] where a = -3i, b=4.

Multiply by σ_y:

First element: a * (0) + b*(i) → a*0 is 0, b*i is 4i. So 4i.

Second element: a*(-i) + b*0 → a*(-i) is (-3i)*(-i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we need to multiply this result by ψ, which is [3i, 4]^T. So it's a row vector multiplied by a column vector.

So (4i) * 3i + (-3) * 4.

Compute each term:

4i * 3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ is -24.

But wait, that's just the numerator. The expectation value is (ψ† σ_y ψ) multiplied by (ħ/2), because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

Wait wait, no. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me re-examine. The spin operator is S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So when we compute the expectation value, it's (ψ† S_y ψ) = (ħ/2) (ψ† σ_y ψ). So the expectation value is (ħ/2) times (ψ† σ_y ψ).

Wait, but also, sometimes the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, which would already include the operator. So if the state isn't normalized, it's not divided by anything. Oh wait, no. The expectation value is just ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I don't need to normalize unless the state isn't normalized. Wait, no, wait: the state is given as (3i,4), but that's just a vector. So I have to compute the inner product, but the state ψ may not be a unit vector. So wait, perhaps the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), but only if the state is not normalized.

Wait, no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S |ψ⟩, regardless of normalization. Because the expectation value is defined as the average when the state is normalized. So if the state isn't normalized, the expectation value is (⟨ψ| S |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of an observable is the average value when the state is a normalized state. If the state is not normalized, you can't compute the expectation directly because the probabilities don't sum to one. So to find the expectation value, you have to normalize the state first. So the correct approach is to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

Wait, but in some textbooks, the expectation value is defined as (ψ† S ψ) / (ψ† ψ) when ψ isn't normalized. So I think that's the case here.

So first, let's compute ψ† ψ, the inner product of ψ with itself.

ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† ψ is (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4).

Compute each term:

-3i * 3i = (-9 i^2) = (-9)(-1) = 9.

4*4 = 16.

So ψ† ψ = 9 + 16 = 25.

So the denominator is 25.

Now, the numerator is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, which is (ħ/2) times (ψ† σ_y ψ), which we calculated as -24 earlier.

Wait, wait: earlier calculation of ψ† σ_y ψ was -24. So ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (ψ† σ_y ψ). So that's (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ) / 2 = -12 ħ.

So the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ) / 25, because the denominator is 25.

So putting it all together, ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, which matches.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle},
\]

where \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \) and \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \)
The inner product \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \) is given by:

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4).
\]

- \( (3i)(-3i) = -9i^2 = -9(-1) = 9 \),
- \( (4)(4) = 16 \).

Thus:

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \sigma_y \) are used to compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
\]

- \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),
- \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).

Thus:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The spin operator \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), so:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi | S_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{\frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\frac{\hbar}{2} (-24)}{25} = \frac{-24 \hbar}{2 \cdot 25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \( \langle S_y \rangle = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
