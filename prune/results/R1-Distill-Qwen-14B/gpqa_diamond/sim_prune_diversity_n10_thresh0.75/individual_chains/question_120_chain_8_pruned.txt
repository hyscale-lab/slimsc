Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky relative to more distant stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. From what I remember, the formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Wait, so if I imagine looking at the sky and dividing the parallax into small ranges, how does the count of stars in each range change as the parallax value changes?

I think it's related to how the density of stars changes with distance. Oh right, in a uniform distribution, the number density of stars might depend on how much volume you can observe at each distance. Because volume increases with the cube of the distance, right? But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, that might complicate things.

Let me model this. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars N is N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density of stars (stars per unit volume).

But since we're looking at parallax, let me express this in terms of plx. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Then, dd is the change in distance. Let's compute dd in terms of plx. If plx changes by d_plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d_plx. Hmm, because d=1/plx so dd = -1/(plx)^2 d_plx.

Wait, but when considering a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + d_plx, that corresponds to a change in distance from d to d - (d_plx / d²). But maybe I should think in terms of transforming the variables.

Alternatively, let's express N, the number of stars in a parallax range d_plx. So d_plx is a small change in parallax. The corresponding change in distance is from d to d - delta_d. The number of stars in that range would be
