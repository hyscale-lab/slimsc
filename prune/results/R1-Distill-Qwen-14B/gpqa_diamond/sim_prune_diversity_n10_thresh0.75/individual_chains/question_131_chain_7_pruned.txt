Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, the structure must have two carboxylic acid groups and a double bond in the cis configuration. Then, this acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which makes sense.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is usually around where aromatic protons or maybe carbonyl adjacent protons show up. Wait, but anhydrides don't have aromatic protons... Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride. Oh wait, the 1H NMR shows a single peak. So a singlet integrating for maybe two protons? Because in a cyclic anhydride, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl could be equivalent. Like in maleic anhydride, the protons are equivalent and split into a singlet. But in maleic, the H are deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm.

Wait, but in the question, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe it's a five-membered cyclic anhydride, like the one from a diacid with a cis double bond. So for example, if the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, that would form a different kind of anhydride. Wait, no, if the double bond is cis, maybe it forms a cyclic anhydride with two carbonyl groups and a double bond.

Wait, but the 1H NMR of the anhydride is a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that the H's are equivalent and not split by any neighboring H's. So maybe it's a structure where the two H's are in a
