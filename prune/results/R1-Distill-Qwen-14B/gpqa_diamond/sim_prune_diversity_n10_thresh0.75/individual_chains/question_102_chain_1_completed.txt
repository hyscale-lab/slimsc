Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology constructs and gene expression. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is that someone has created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so two genes in one construct. The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, but there are stop cassettes in between. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. I think IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the downstream gene without the need for a stop in between. But wait, in this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element.

Wait, so the construct is probably set up so that the CBA promoter drives the expression of the ligand, and then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate transcript or maybe co-translated? Or maybe they're under the same promoter but different IRES elements.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, meaning it's designed to express both ligand and receptor. The ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. Wait, no. Wait, the question says: the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Upstream of the receptor (so the 5' side of the receptor) is the IRES. Wait, maybe the construct is: CBA promoter → ligand ORF with stop in loxP cassette, then IRES, then receptor ORF with stop in lox2272.

Wait, no, the question says the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP cassette. So ligand is followed by a stop, but that stop is flanked by loxP sites. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

Wait, so the vector is designed with two separate cassettes. The first gene is the ligand, which is under the CBA promoter. Then comes a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), so that transcription would stop, but with loxP sites. Then, I think the IRES element is upstream of the receptor. So the construct is perhaps: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → stop cassette (loxP) → IRES → receptor ORF → stop cassette (lox2272) → eGFP.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: bicistronic vectors often have two cistrons separated by an IRES. So the first cistron is under a promoter, and the second is after an IRES, which allows it to be expressed without the need for a second promoter. So in this case, the ligand is at the 5' end, under CBA promoter. Then comes a stop cassette (loxP) so that the ligand is terminated, and then the IRES, which allows the second cistron (receptor ORF) to be read. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so maybe the IRES drives the expression of the receptor after the ligand.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are expressed from the same transcript, but each as separate ORFs. The first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is after an IRES, which allows its expression.

So the construct would be: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → stop (loxP) → IRES → receptor ORF → stop (lox2272) → eGFP.

But wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. So perhaps the ligand and mCherry are in a single ORF, and the receptor and eGFP are in another ORF.

Wait, maybe the ligand is cloned in such a way that it's in frame with mCherry, meaning that when the ORF is translated, the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is in frame with eGFP. But in between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So perhaps the construct is ligand followed by mCherry, without a stop in between. But the question says that between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Oh, that's confusing. So the ligand is in its own ORF, and after it, a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry? Or is the mCherry part of the same ORF? I think it's more likely that the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and then the next part is a stop cassette, but with loxP sites. Then, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the setup is as follows: the first ORF is ligand, then a stop with loxP. Then after the IRES, the second ORF is receptor. But the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So when the IRES is functional, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is only expressed if the lox2272 stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 stops are each in separate cassettes. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and then a stop cassette with loxP, so that without Cre, the ligand is expressed. But when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed after the ligand. Hmm, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps the vector is a loxP site followed by a stop, followed by mCherry. So the ligand is at the 5' end, and when the stop is removed (using Cre), the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. So when Cre is present, the lox2272 is cut, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, the question says that a bicistronic vector was used. So perhaps the construct is designed so that in the absence of Cre, both the ligand and receptor are under the same promoter but with their own stops. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

The main point is that the person created this vector, transfected it into primary astrocyte culture, and then used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to test Western blot. They saw signals proportional to actin loading, so the proteins are being expressed.

Then, they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. They don't see a green signal, which is eGFP.

So the question is why there's no green signal.

Options are A to D.

So the possible issues are that the eGFP isn't expressed. Let's think about the setup.

The construct is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor is after an IRES, which is under the same promoter. Then, the stop cassettes are in loxP and lox2272.

Wait, the IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF. So the same mRNA is used for both ligand and receptor expression. The ligand is at the 5', then the stop cassette (loxP), then IRES, then receptor ORF, stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So the construct is designed so that the receptor is expressed as a fusion with eGFP.

But when the person uses SOX10-Cre, which is a mouse model where SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, the Cre would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, in the vector, the stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So, without Cre, the ligand would have a stop, and then mCherry, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have a stop before eGFP. But when Cre is present, which is the case when the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, the loxP and lox2272 sites would be recombined. So the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so ligand should be expressed. The receptor is after an IRES, so its expression would depend on the IRES.

But the person is using SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic mouse where Cre is expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre would be active there, leading to recombination.

If the Cre is active, then the loxP and lox2272 sites would be cut, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed, followed by mCherry, and the receptor would be expressed followed by eGFP.

But in the experiment, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, they don't see a green signal, which is eGFP.

So why no green?

Possible reasons:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the IRES is functional, the receptor is translated, and eGFP is part of the same ORF. So if the stop is in a lox2272 cassette, and Cre is active, the stop is removed, so the ORF would be receptor-eGFP. If the frame is correct, eGFP should be expressed. So if the frame is wrong, the eGFP would not be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the protein isn't secreted or isn't on the cell surface. But the question says the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading. So if the protein were expressed, it would show up on the blot. But if the construct isn't properly processed, maybe it's retained in the ER or Golgi. But the Western blot uses total proteins, so if the receptor-eGFP is made but not secreted, it should still be present in the lysate. So the blot would still pick it up. But in the question, the Western blot shows a signal, so the proteins are expressed. So the issue isn't expression but perhaps the eGFP isn't being produced. Wait, no, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes. The mouse model is a different experiment. So perhaps the problem is in the mouse model, not the initial plasmid.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the mouse, the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed as part of the receptor.

But why isn't eGFP expressed? Let's look at the options.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If the promoter isn't working, then neither ligand nor receptor would be expressed. But the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so that's unlikely. Plus, the Western blot in the initial experiment showed expression, so the promoter is working.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. So the ligand is produced by one cell and acts on another. But the question is about the expression in the mouse, and the eGFP isn't showing up. This might relate to whether the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell, but I'm not sure how that affects the expression of eGFP.

Wait, the eGFP is part of the receptor construct. So if the receptor isn't expressed, then eGFP won't be either. But in the mouse, the construct is supposed to be activated by Cre. So why isn't the receptor expressed?

Wait, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. IRES allows the translation of the second ORF. If the IRES isn't working, then the receptor isn't expressed, even if the promoter is active. But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

But in the mouse, the construct is in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not. With Cre, the loxP sites are cut, so the stop is removed, allowing the IRES to function, thereby allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But perhaps the IRES isn't working, so even after the stop is removed, the receptor isn't expressed. But that would mean that eGFP isn't expressed, which is what's happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is translated, but eGFP isn't because the ORF is broken. So the eGFP isn't produced.

Wait, the original vector is designed as ligand followed by a stop (loxP), then IRES, then receptor followed by a stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is on a separate ORF after the receptor. So the construct is: CBA promoter → ligand ORF → stop (loxP) → IRES → receptor ORF → stop (lox2272) → eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites are recombined, removing the two stops. So the ligand would be expressed, and the receptor would be expressed, and eGFP would be expressed as a separate ORF after the receptor. But that would require another IRES, which the question doesn't mention. So perhaps the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor.

Wait, no. The question says the receptor is at the 3' position and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. So the construct is: receptor-eGFP as a single ORF. So when the stop is removed (after Cre), the receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed.

But if the frame is wrong, then the eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the ORF after the stop is not in the same reading frame, so eGFP isn't made. Thus, no green signal.

Another possibility is that the stop cassettes are not correctly recombined. Maybe the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, but I think lox2272 is a variant recognized by Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so even without the stop, the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot in the initial experiment showed expression, which suggests that the IRES works.

Wait, but the initial experiment was in primary astrocytes transfected with the plasmid. The mouse model is a different expression system. So maybe in the mouse, the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning that the vector is integrated into the genome. So the CBA promoter should drive expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the eGFP is under a different promoter. But the question states that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES, so same promoter.

Wait, another angle: the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. So only one copy of Cre. But the construct is homozygous, so both alleles would have the lox sites. So Cre from the SOX10-Cre mouse would recombine both alleles.

So if the vector is correctly recombined, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, eGFP isn't observed. So why?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the stop is correctly removed, but the ORF is not in frame, so eGFP isn't made. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in the initial Western blot, the plasmid was transfected, which probably allowed the IRES to function.

Wait, but the mouse may have different conditions. Maybe the IRES isn't active in that cell type. If the IRES doesn't function, then the receptor isn't expressed, so eGFP isn't either.

But the Western blot in the initial experiment showed that the proteins are expressed when the plasmid is transfected. But in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't working, leading to no eGFP expression.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being expressed but not fluorescing. But that's less likely. Also, the question says no green signal, implying eGFP isn't expressed.

Another possibility: the IRES is before the receptor, but after the stop cassette. So the stop is loxP, then IRES, then receptor. So when the stop is removed, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed.

But I'm not sure. Let me look at the options again.

Option D suggests that the ORF of the receptor and eGFP is not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Another option is A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So the ligand is made by one cell, and receptor by another. But in this case, the construct is in the same cell. So that might not explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the ligand and receptor aren't expressed in the cells being visualized. But the question says they're looking under the confocal. If the construct is expressed in neural crest cells, which are the target of SOX10-Cre, but perhaps the visualization isn't capturing those cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre. The construct is supposed to be active in neural crest cells, so the eGFP should be expressed there.

So why isn't it showing up?

If the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is wrong, that would fit option D. Alternatively, if the eGFP is expressed but not fluorescent for some other reason, but the question states that no green signal is observed.

So I'm thinking the most likely option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is positioned downstream of an IRES element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and eGFP, there is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The construct was introduced into a mouse model homozygous for the vector, which was then crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, where it should recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes and allowing expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein. However, no green signal corresponding to eGFP was observed under confocal microscopy.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct. The lack of a green signal is not explained by a paracrine relationship, as the construct is designed for co-expression in the same cell. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were retained in the Golgi, it would still be present in the lysate and detectable on a Western blot. However, the question specifies that no green signal was observed under the confocal microscope, which directly visualizes eGFP fluorescence. This suggests the issue is not with trafficking but with expression of eGFP itself. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, and the Western blot after plasmid transfection showed expression of the proteins. This indicates that the promoter is functional and that the enhancer is not the limiting factor. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The eGFP is fused to the receptor at the C-terminus. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed as a functional protein. This would result in no green signal under the confocal microscope, consistent with the observed outcome. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of a green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame, preventing proper expression of eGFP.
