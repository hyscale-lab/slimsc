Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember they're diamondoid, so they have a cage-like structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgeheads, probably on opposite sides.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh right, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Wait, but here it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So that's not a vicinal dihalide. Hmm, but maybe it's a case where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Oh wait, perhaps in the adamantane structure, 1 and 3 are on the same bridge. I'm not entirely sure, but let's think about the product.

The product is a light yellow solid, and the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet in the 2.41-2.23 range (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone.

Wait, so if the reaction is with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with a strong base like KOH, could lead to elimination of two equivalents of HBr and form a diene or a conjugated diene? Or perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkene?

Wait, but the product shows a carbonyl group. So maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. Another possibility is that the base causes dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines, perhaps forming a ketone. Oh wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads. If
