Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me read the problem again. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses respectively. Their radii are 1.7 Earth radii and 1.3. Both orbits are circular.

The question gives some data about the Doppler shifts from each planet. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. The albedo is the same for both planets.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. So I should probably be thinking about the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature (Te) of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π^2 * σ * D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, or is it more precise to think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law? Since the star emits energy, and the planet absorbs some of it, then radiates as a blackbody.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

Te = ( ( R_star^2 * T_star^4 ) / (a^2) )^(1/4) * sqrt( (1 - a) / (16) )

Wait, no, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation from the planet. The formula can be written as:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4)

Hmm, wait, no, I think the more precise formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but wait, let me think. The flux from the star at the planet's orbit is F = L_star / (4π a^2), where a is the orbital
