Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not super relevant for this question. The key point is that they're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet's period is longer by that ratio.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. And we're told they have the same albedo. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Since albedo is the same, that part is equal, so I can focus on distance and luminosity.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^(1/4), but since albedo 'a' is the same for both planets, it cancels out. So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Wait, actually, wait. Let me think again. The formula can be simplified because (1-a) is the same; so T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / D^(1/2).

Wait, wait another thought. The formula for equilibrium temperature, if I recall correctly, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 D)}), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star its radius, and D the planet's distance from the star. Alternatively, another way to write it is involving the luminosity. Because L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting that, T_planet = T_star * ( (L/(4π σ)) / (16 π σ D² (1 - a)) )^(1/4) ), but I might be mixing up some terms here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of flux received.

Flux from the star at a distance D is F = L / (4 π D²). The planet absorbs (1 - a) * F, and then the equilibrium temperature arises from the balance between absorbed energy and emitted as blackbody radiation. So, F*(1 - a)/4 = σ T^4. So solving for T gives T = [ (F (1 - a)) / (4 σ) ]^(1/4 ). Substituting F, we get T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / (D^(1/2)).

Wait, but in the problem, the luminosity L of the star is the same for all planets, right? Because all planets orbit the same star. So
