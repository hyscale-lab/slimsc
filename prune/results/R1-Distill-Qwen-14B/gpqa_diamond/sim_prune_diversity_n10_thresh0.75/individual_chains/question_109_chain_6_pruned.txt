Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle and the allowed partial waves based on conservation laws. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

So the setup is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T here is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. Oh, right, Pauli's exclusion principle for identical fermions, so their total state must be antisymmetric. That includes combining spin, isospin, and spatial parts.

The question says the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T_final is 0. I remember that the initial state is 1S0, so let's figure out the quantum numbers there.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L^J. So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1, so S=0. So S_initial is 0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, so L_initial is 0 because it's S state. J is 0, so the initial state has spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0.

When they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is (-1)^(L_initial + L_X) = overall parity change. Wait, the parity before emission would have to relate to the parity after, considering the particle X.

Wait, in the initial state, the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0, parity is +1. When they emit X, the parity of the system (NN plus X) should be determined by the parity of X and the orbital angular momentum involved. But since the system (NN) is emitting X, the parity of the combined state would be the parity of the orbital angular momentum state used in the emission. So the orbital angular momentum state of X when emitted would contribute to the parity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The parity of the initial state is +1, as it's 1S0. After emission, the NN system might change their orbital angular momentum, and the particle X carries away some orbital angular momentum state.

But the problem says the emission is a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the entire final state (NN in some state and X) must be conserved if we're considering parity conservation. But wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. Hmm, but parity isn't necessarily conserved in strong interactions, but in this case, maybe it is? Or perhaps it's about the selection rules for the process.

Wait, the initial state parity is (+1) because it's 1S0. The final state consists of the NN in some state and the emitted particle X. The parity of the final state would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number for X? Or is it the orbital part of the emitted particle?

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a decay process: NN (initial state) → NN (final state) + X. The parity before and after must be considered.

The initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since the initial state is 1S0, L_initial is 0 → P_initial = +1.

The final state has the NN in a state with orbital angular momentum L_NN, and the emitted particle X is in an orbital angular momentum state l_X. The parity of the final state would be P_final = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} * P_X.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the two systems (the NN and X) contributes to
