Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are atoms bonded to four different groups. But wait, there are other factors too, like the presence of a plane of symmetry or if the compound is meso.

Let me go through each compound one by one. I'll list them out as I remember:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one

Starting with the first one: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-C=CHCH2CH3? Oh wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon (double bond between C1 and C2). So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait no, butene is four carbons. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would have a methyl on C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3) with a double bond to C1. So structure is CH2Clâ€“CH(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the first carbon is CH2Cl, the second is CH(CH3), but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2
