Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct equation relating their temperatures. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy states can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. So the excitation depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula I recall is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ). Here, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem gives that the excitation (so the ratio of excited to ground state) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, actually, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if star_1 has a higher ratio of excited atoms, that must relate to higher temperature, because higher T means more atoms can be excited.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Each R is given by (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Assuming that the statistical weights (g) are the same for both stars, because they're both iron atoms in the same energy levels. So the ratio simplifies to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)) for each star.

So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But wait, wait. No, wait. Because if the energy level is excited, the number in the higher level is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for star_1, R1 is higher than R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting, 2 R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no. The problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_
