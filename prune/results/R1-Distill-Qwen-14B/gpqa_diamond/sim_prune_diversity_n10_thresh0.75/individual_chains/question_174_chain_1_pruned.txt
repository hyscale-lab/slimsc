Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

So the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. No other products, so just two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, which is a much smaller unit than GeV, so the difference is probably small, but I'll have to see.

First, let me note down the given data:

- Initial mass: M (rest-mass energy is 300 GeV, so that's E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV)
- After fission: two fragments, masses m1 and m2.
- Given: m1 = 2 * m2 (so m1 is twice as massive as m2)
- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M

Wait, because the sum is 99% of M. Since M is the initial mass, which is at rest, but in reality, when a nucleus fissions, the sum of the rest masses of the products is less than the initial because energy is released as kinetic energy and other forms. So that's why the sum is 0.99 M, implying that 1% of the mass was converted into kinetic energy or something.

But wait, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV. But when it splits into two, the sum of their rest mass energies is 0.99 * M c², which would be 297 GeV. So the difference, 3 GeV, must be the energy released, which includes the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

Wait, but I think in fission, the rest mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent, so
