Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector in a 2-dimensional space, often visualized on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and any pure state is a point on the surface, while mixed states are inside the sphere.

Wait, but how does this relate to the density matrix? The density matrix for a pure state has a trace of 1 and is idempotent (ρ² = ρ), while for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. Let me check what ρ is here.

So the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks like a classical mixture of the |0> and |1> states each with probability 1/2. So it's a maximally mixed state, right? Because it's equally likely to be in either state.

Maximally mixed states have the maximum entropy for a qubit. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is represented by the origin because all the information is lost, and the state is equally spread out. So the vector r should be (0,0,0). Because in the Bloch sphere representation, the vector goes from the origin to the point (x,y,z), where z is the probability amplitude for |1> minus |0>.

Wait, but how exactly is the Bloch vector related to the density matrix? I think the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r = (x, y, z). The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I expand ρ, it's (I + σ_z)/2 for this case because |0><0| corresponds to (I + σ_z)/2 and |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. So adding them gives [ (I + σ_z) + (I - σ_z)
