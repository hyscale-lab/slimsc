Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out which one fits based on the rules I remember.

First, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the problem already defines E as E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level can be expressed as E multiplied by n². So E_1 is E*(1), E_2 is E*(4), E_3 is E*(9), and so on.

But wait, these are spin-1/2 particles. So each particle has a spin of 1/2, which means that each particle can have two possible spin states: up and down. Since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each state must be unique, and no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. So each n can have two fermions (with opposite spins). Because spin is 1/2, each spatial state (n) can accommodate two particles.

Wait, but in this problem, the particles are identical spin-1/2, so each quantum state can hold two particles. So when building up the states, we'll have to consider the filling of these states according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

So for N=4 particles, we'll need to fill up the lowest energy levels with as many particles as possible, each level holding two particles max. Let me think about that.

The ground state is the lowest possible energy. So the first two particles can go into n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two particles need to go into the next available state, which is n=2.

Wait, no. Because each n can have two particles (since spin can be up or down), for two particles, the first n=1 can hold two particles (their spins are both allowed). Then for the third and fourth particles, they have
