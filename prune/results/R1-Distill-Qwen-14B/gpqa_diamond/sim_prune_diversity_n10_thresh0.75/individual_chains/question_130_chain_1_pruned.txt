Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen that can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

The clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second energy level to the first, right? So when this absorption occurs, the quasar's light at 1216 Angstroms gets absorbed by the hydrogen.

But wait, if the hydrogen cloud is moving away from us, or if the universe is expanding, the wavelength of that absorbed light will shift to a longer wavelength—redshifted. So the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) will be lambda_rest multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. The formula is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

The problem is asking about the lower limit on the redshift so that these clouds can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, which is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line is originally at 1216 Angstroms. If the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. But for this to be detectable in the optical range (since it's a ground-based telescope), the observed wavelength must be within 4000-7000 Angstroms. 

Let me think: the higher the redshift, the longer the observed wavelength. So the lower limit on redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just at the lower end of the optical range, which is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, actually, the upper end is 7000 Angstroms (red end of visible light), so we might consider the maximum wavelength a telescope can detect. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the optical window.

Wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths much below about 380 nm (violet) because the atmosphere absorbs below that—like the ozone layer blocks a lot of UV. So maybe the practical lower limit for optical is higher than 380 nm. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more straightforward.

So, to find the minimum redshift z such that Lyman alpha is observed in the optical range. Let's compute when 1216*(1+z) is equal to the lower end of the optical, say 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Alternatively, does the optical window start higher? Wait, optical is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

So if the observed lambda has to be >=4000 Angstroms, then: 1216*(1+z) >=4000.

Let me compute that. 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29. So 1+z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29. So the minimum z would be about 2.29.

But wait, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.29 is close to option C)2.4, but actually, 2.29 is less than that. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the division.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The observed wavelength needs to be in optical, say, the lower end for the optical is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So 4000 = 1216*(1+z). Let's compute 4000/1216.

Let me calculate 4000 divided by 1216. 1216 * 3 = 3648. 3648 is 3 times. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 352/1216 ≈ 0.289. So 3.289. So 1+z =3.289 → z≈2.289. So approximately 2.29.

So the minimum redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher number is option C)2.4, but wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the observed wavelength can't be beyond the telescope's range. Or perhaps the maximum wavelength that can be detected is 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). Let me compute that.

If lambda_obs=7000 Angstroms, then 1+z=7000/1216≈5.756. So z≈4.756. But that's a much higher redshift. So that's the maximum redshift, not the minimum.

Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum redshift is when the Lyman alpha line is just entering the optical range. So when 1216*(1+z) is equal to 4000 Angstroms, as I did before, which gives z≈2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4 and D is 1.9. Hmm, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. So perhaps the question expects us to use a lower limit of optical being higher than 400 nm.

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the cutoff isn't at 400 nm but higher. Because for ground-based telescopes, the atmosphere is opaque below about 320 nm (far UV). So anything below that is absorbed. So the observed Lyman alpha must be in the range that isn't absorbed by the atmosphere. So the lower end for optical is about 400 nm, but perhaps sometimes 320 nm is considered the start of the near UV for some telescopes, but for optical, I think we stick to 400 nm and above.

So perhaps, using 4000 Angstroms is correct.

But wait,
