Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual problem has two parts, A and B. Let me break it down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which compound does NOT show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Hmm. I need to figure out each part separately.

Starting with Part A. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structures. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, if there's an adjacent hydroxyl group, they can tautomerize, like in the case of keto-enol tautomerism.

Looking at the two compounds:

1. Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic di-ketone. It has two ketone groups. The structure is like a benzene ring with two oxygen double bonds. The structure of benzoquinone is such that the two ketone groups are in para positions. So, does it show tautomerism? Well, quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl. Let me think. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. For tautomerism, you need an alpha hydrogen. Wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are directly attached to the ring. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl are the ring carbons, which are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached. So, wait, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the carbonyls are at the positions where the ring is. So, no alpha H, so no keto-enol tautomerism. Or wait, maybe I'm wrong. I should think again. 

Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So the structure is like two ketone groups across the ring. Each ketone is C=O attached to a benz
