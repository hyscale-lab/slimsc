Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it again to make sure I get all the details. 

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we have the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, so I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? And the different K values correspond to the three dissociation steps of H3PO4. So first, H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (that's the first Ka), then H2PO4^- loses another to become HPO4^2- (second Ka), and finally HPO4^2- loses another to become PO4^3- (third Ka).

Wait, but the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So both of these are phosphate salts. KH2PO4 is the diprotic form, I think. Let me think: KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-? Because that's the first dissociation. And Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-, plus the waters, but the waters probably don't affect the calculation much here.

So we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. The PO4^3- is the orthophosphate, so I need to find the concentration of that.

Wait, but in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on pH. The pH will determine which form is predominant. The problem here is that we have a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base in solution. Because H2PO4^- is a weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base
