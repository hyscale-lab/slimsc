Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Hmm, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The particles are spin-1/2, which is important because that affects how they can occupy energy levels. Oh right, identical particles with half-integer spins are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.

The well has length L, and each particle is in this well. The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? Which they've simplified to E times some factor, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So each E_n is n² times this E.

But wait, there are four particles here. So each will occupy different energy levels, or maybe some can share the same level if possible. Oh no, wait, because they are spin-1/2, each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each energy level n, you can have two fermions.

So let's think about filling up the energy levels. The ground state would have the lowest possible energies, then the first excited will have the next possible, and so on.

The energy levels for a single particle: n=1 is the lowest, then n=2, 3, 4, etc. Each of these can hold up to two particles because of the spin.

So for four particles, how do they fill up?

Ground state: The lowest energy is n=1. Since two particles can go there (spin up and down), then the third and fourth particles will go into the next available level, which is n=2.

Wait, but wait: Each particle must have a unique quantum state. So for n=1, you can have two particles: (n=1, spin up) and (n=1, spin down). Then the next two must go to n=2, each with their own spins. So n=2 holds two particles as well.

Wait, but four particles would fill up n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So the ground state total energy would be the sum of the energies of each particle.

Each particle in n=1
