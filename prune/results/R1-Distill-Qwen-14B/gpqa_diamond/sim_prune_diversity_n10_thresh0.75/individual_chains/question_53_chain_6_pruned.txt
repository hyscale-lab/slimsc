Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which means it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The possible formulas given are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.

The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's one functional group identified. Then, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for methyl groups. Importantly, there are no signals for CH2 groups.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the aromatic ring is substituted with two groups. The di-substitution could be in the para, meta, or ortho positions. But since the aromatic H NMR shows two signals, that suggests that there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are opposite each other (para), the ring would have two equivalent sets of aromatic protons, each perhaps a doublet of doublets or something like that. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the meta position, maybe the protons are split into two different environments, leading to two different signals.

But wait, the substituents are probably such that the ring has some symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are in the para position, giving two equivalent H environments each with two protons, or maybe it's an ortho substitution, but that might give more signals. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact splitting in di-substituted rings, but perhaps I can think about the other parts of the spectrum first.

The NMR also shows two vinyl H signals. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. One of the signals is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests perhaps a substituent with a double bond, maybe an ester with an adjacent group.

Wait, the IR has an ester group, so the compound likely has an ester functional group.
