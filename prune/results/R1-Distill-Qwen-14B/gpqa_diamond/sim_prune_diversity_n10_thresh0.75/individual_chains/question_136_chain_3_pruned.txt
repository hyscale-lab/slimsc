Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, I'm to find ∫ (∇ · f) dV over this volume.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

Wait, but wait, what's the divergence of f in this case? Since f only has a radial component, let's denote it as f_r. In spherical coordinates, the divergence formula for a vector field with only the radial component (and zero angular components) is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). 

So, f_r is 1/r². Plugging into the divergence formula:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].
Simplifying inside the derivative: r² * 1/r² = 1. So, d/dr of 1 is 0. Hence, ∇ · f = 0.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, that would mean the integral is zero, but let me think again. Because the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because f(r) is 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a point charge, but wait, for a point charge, the divergence is zero except at r=0. Oh, right, because the divergence depends on the function being twice differentiable or something.

Wait, but in that case, when evaluating the volume integral over a sphere that includes the origin, maybe the divergence is only non-zero at r=0, which is a point. But wait, the divergence is zero everywhere else, so the integral over the volume would just be the contribution from the origin. Hmm, but wait, how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps using the divergence theorem is a better approach. The
