Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see what I remember about gene function, knockouts, and their effects on plant resistance to pathogens.

So, the setup is that they're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They've made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key point given is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So one of them is a regulator, and the others might be downstream target genes.

The question is about determining the interaction between these genes based on the resistance levels of the mutants. The resistance is measured as a percentage of the control (wild-type), which is 100%. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility to the disease.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type, but not super susceptible.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% → more susceptible than wild type.
- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. So the single mutants: g2 completely loses resistance. g1 is 75%, which is still some resistance, and g3 is 50%.

The double mutants: When you have g2 with any other, the resistance drops to 0%. So g2g1 and g2g3 are both 0%, same as g2 alone. But wait, what about g1g3? That's 10%, which is worse than g3 alone (50%) but not as bad as g2's effect.

Wait, but why does g2 have such a strong effect? The fact that when you have g2 in any double mutant, it's 0% suggests that g2 is perhaps downstream of the other genes or maybe it's a transcription factor that's essential for the others.

Wait, no, because if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then disrupting it would prevent its target genes from being expressed. So if G2 activates G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But wait, in the data, when only G2 is knocked out, the plant's resistance is 0%. So that suggests that without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.

But looking at the double mutants: when both G2 and G1 are knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0%, same as G2 alone. Similarly for g2g3, it's 0%. That makes sense if G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is not working, then both G1 and G3 aren't either. So the phenotype would be the same as when G2 is not working. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about the g1g3 double mutant? It's 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. That suggests that disrupting both G1 and G3 together makes things worse than either alone, which could mean that they have some overlapping function or redundancy. Or perhaps they each contribute a part of the resistance, so disrupting both removes both contributions.

Now, the question is about the conclusion. The options suggest various interactions like epistasis, gene redundancy, pleiotropy, etc.

Epistasis is when one gene's phenotype masks the effect of another. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in A determines whether the effect of B is visible.

From the data, when G2 is knocked out, all the double mutants with G2 are 0%, same as G2 alone. That might suggest that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because the presence of a non-functional G2 (knockout) masks the function of G1 and G3. So when G2 is not working, no matter what G1 or G3 are doing, the plant can't resist.

Alternatively, maybe the resistance pathway is that G2 is upstream, activating G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed. But that's not exactly the case here because when G1 and G3 are knocked out together, the resistance is 10%, which isn't zero. So perhaps G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that contribute to resistance.

Wait, let me think again. 

In the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → so, G1 is contributing to resistance, but when knocked out, it doesn't completely lose resistance. Maybe G1 is part of a pathway but not the only one.
- g2: 0% → without G2, no resistance. So whatever pathway G2 is in is essential.
- g3: 50% → similar to g1, but not as much. So G3 contributes, but perhaps less than G1.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So if G2 is knocked out, adding G1 knockout doesn't change the outcome. So G2's effect is what's causing the problem, regardless of G1. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of a non-functional G2 determines the outcome, regardless of G1.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% → same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Now, g1g3 has 10% resistance. Which is worse than either single. So knocking out both G1 and G3 makes the plant more susceptible than either alone. This suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance drops further. Alternatively, they might be part of the same pathway but provide additive effects.

Wait, but what if
