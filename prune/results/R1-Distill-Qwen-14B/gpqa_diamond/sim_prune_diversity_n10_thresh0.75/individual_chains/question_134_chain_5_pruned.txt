Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D with various values.

Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. But wait, some acids are diprotic, so I need to be careful about how much H+ they contribute.

First, let's figure out the moles of each acid and base component.

Starting with HCl. It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Molarity is moles per liter. So for HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. It's sulfuric acid, a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. No, wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

Wait, but actually, I think the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no, wait, no. Wait, wait: the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- and that's strong, so it's complete. The second dissociation, HSO4^- → H+ + SO
