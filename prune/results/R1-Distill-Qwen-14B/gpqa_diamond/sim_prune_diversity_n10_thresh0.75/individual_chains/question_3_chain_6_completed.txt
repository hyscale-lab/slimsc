Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition state. Alright, I remember that spin-half particles have spin states like up and down, which are eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, but I should check if the coefficients are normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of the amplitudes. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Adding them, 0.25 + 0.75 is 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute this for the given state.

Since expectation values are linear, I can break this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So first, find ⟨σz⟩ and then ⟨σx⟩.

Let me recall that σz is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So for any state, the expectation value of σz is the probability of being in |↑⟩ minus the probability of being in |↓⟩.

In the given state, the coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5)= -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Wait, but the expectation value of σx can be found using the state's components.

I remember that the expectation value of σx is given by ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) if the state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0 1],[1 0]], σy = [[0 -i],[i 0]], σz = [[1 0],[0 -1]].

So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write this out.

The state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the basis |↑⟩, |↓⟩. So ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Wait, that's 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) )= 2*(sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait, let me recheck. The expectation value is the inner product of ψ with σx ψ. So ψ is a column vector [a; b], then σx ψ is [b; a].

So ψ† σx ψ = a*(b) + b*(a) = 2ab.

So, in this case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2*( (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866. So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

Wait, but wait, no, because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value of σx for a state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ is (a^2 + b^2) but wait, no, because σx is Hermitian, but the matrix representation would have off-diagonal terms.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is ⟨σx⟩ = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 )? Or is that another operator? No, wait. Maybe I should compute it correctly.

Let me compute ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩.

ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2)^T.

So σx |ψ⟩ is [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T.

Now, the inner product ψ† σx ψ is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) ) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Yes, so ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, which is approximately 0.866.

So putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866).

Calculating:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(0.866) = 4.33.

Adding: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but the options are up to one decimal. Let me compute more precisely.

sqrt(3)= approx 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is 0.866. So 5*(0.866)=4.33.

So 10*σz expectation is -5, 5σx is 4.33, sum is -5+4.33= -0.67.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is the closest. Because -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but wait another thing—did I compute ⟨σx⟩ correctly? Because I've heard that for spin systems, the expectation value of σx is 2ab, where a is the amplitude of |↑⟩ and b is amplitude of |↓⟩. Let me see:

In this case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= (sqrt(3)/2 )= approx 0.866, which matches what I got before. So that's correct.

So the total expectation value is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer should be option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the operator directly. The operator is 10σz +5σx.

Let me write out each matrix.

σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]].

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]].

So 10σz +5σx is [[10,5],[5,-10]].

The state is ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So to compute ⟨ψ | (10σz +5σx) | ψ ⟩, it's ψ† multiplied by the matrix multiplied by ψ.

So let's compute it:

First, compute (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

This is [[10,5],[5,-10]] multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the first component is 10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

The second component is 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= 2.5 -5*sqrt(3).

So the result is [5 + (5√3/2), 2.5 -5√3 ]^T.

Now, compute ψ† times this vector. ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ].

So 0.5*(5 + (5√3/2 )) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5√3 )

Calculate each term:

First term: 0.5 *5 =2.5; 0.5*(5√3/2)= (5√3)/4.

So first term total: 2.5 + (5√3)/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2) *2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2; (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5√3)= (-5*3)/2 = (-15/2).

So second term total: (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 - 15/2.

Now add all together:

2.5 + (5√3/4) + (2.5 sqrt(3)/2) - 7.5.

Let's compute the constants and the sqrt(3) terms separately.

Constants: 2.5 -7.5 = -5.

Sqrt(3) terms: (5√3/4 ) + (2.5 √3 /2 ) = let's convert 2.5 to 5/2.

So (5√3/4) + (5√3/4 )= (10√3/4 )= (5√3/2 )= approx (5 *1.732)/2 ≈8.66/2=4.33.

So overall, -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which is approximately -0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \), which can be broken into two parts: \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle \).

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = P(|\uparrow\rangle) \cdot (+1) + P(|\downarrow\rangle) \cdot (-1),
\]
where \( P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( P(|\downarrow\rangle) = |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|^2 = 0.75 \). Substituting these values:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \text{Re}(a \cdot b^*),
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( \psi \), respectively. Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot \text{Re}\left(0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total expectation value
The total expectation value is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to one decimal place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
