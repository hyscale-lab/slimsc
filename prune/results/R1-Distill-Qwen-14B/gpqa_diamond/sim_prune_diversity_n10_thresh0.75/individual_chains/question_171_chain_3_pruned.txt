Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives six substances, each attached to a benzene ring. They undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So lower percentages first, higher later.

First, I need to remember what factors influence the regiochemistry of electrophilic substitution. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) on the ring affect where the substitution occurs. EWGs deactivate the ring and can direct incoming electrophiles to the para position. EDGs activate the ring and usually direct to the ortho and para positions.

Wait, but wait. For activating groups, it's para and ortho substitution. For deactivating, like nitro groups, substitution occurs more in the meta, but wait, no. Deactivating groups can be meta directors or para/ortho, depending on whether they're activating or deactivating. Wait, no: activating groups (like -NH2, -OCH3) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups, like -NO2, are meta directors. But wait, not all deactivating groups are meta directors. For example, if a group is deactivating but ortho/para-directing, like -SO3H may be a strong deactivating but is ortho/para. Hmm, I might need to check that.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Electron-withdrawing groups can have different directing effects. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, but some other groups like carbonyl groups (like in ketones) are meta directors as well. Wait, no, maybe. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents can be either activating (EDGs) or deactivating (EWGs). Activating groups are typically ortho/para directors because they donate electrons into the ring, making the ring more reactive. Deactivating groups (EWGs) are usually meta directors because they withdraw electrons, making the ring less reactive. But wait, some deactivating groups are ortho/para directors. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, but some others like -COOH (carboxylic acid) are deactivating but meta directors. Or wait, wait. No, wait. Actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think: 

- Groups like -NH2, -OCH3 (EDGs) activate the ring and are ortho/para directors.
- Groups like -NO2, -COOH, -COR (like ketones) are deactivating (EWGs) but meta directors. Because they pull electrons away via resonance or inductive effects, so the ring is less reactive, and the incoming electrophile has to go to the meta position relative to them.

But wait, some groups like -X (halogens) are deactivating (since they're more electronegative) but are ortho/para directors. Because the inductive effect withdraws electrons, but the resonance effect can donate electrons in some cases, leading them to direct ortho and para. For example, -F, -Cl, etc.
