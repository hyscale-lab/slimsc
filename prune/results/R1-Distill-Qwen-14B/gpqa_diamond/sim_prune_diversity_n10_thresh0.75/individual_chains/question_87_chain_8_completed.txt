Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, that's interesting.

First, let me parse the information given. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, wait, no, it's a six-membered aromatic ring. So, maybe it's benzene with two substituents, but the total carbon count is 8. Wait, benzene has six carbons, so two substituents would add two more, making it eight? Or maybe each substituent has multiple carbons.

Wait, if the ring has six carbons, and substituents contribute two, perhaps each substituent is a single carbon. But wait, the substituents might have more. Let me think: the compound is di-substituted, so two groups attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents would contribute 8 -6 = 2 carbons in total. That suggests each substituent is a single carbon, or maybe two substituents each with one carbon. But wait, if each substituent is one carbon, but perhaps they're both methyl groups, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, the IR says there's a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen. So, the molecule has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and another is a halogen. But wait, the substituents could be such that one is a halogen (like Cl, Br) and the other is a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group).

Wait, the substituents are attached to the benzene ring. So, benzene with two substituents: one is X (like Cl, Br), and the other is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acetyl group (COCH3), or maybe a ketone like CO-R. But the total number of carbons is 8.

Wait, benzene is 6 carbons. If one substituent is a carbonyl group (like COCH3, which adds 1 C for the CO and 1 for the CH3, but wait, COCH3 is a two-carbon substituent. So if the substituents are X (like Cl) and O=C-O-R? Hmm, not sure. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the total carbon count is 8. So 6 in the ring, plus substituents. Each substituent is a single group. Let's denote substituents as R1 and R2.

If one substituent is -Cl (or another halogen), which is just one atom (no carbons), and another substituent is a carbonyl-containing group. So, for example, maybe an acetyl group (-COCH3), which has two carbons. So substituents: Cl and COCH3. That would add 1 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 3 carbons. Wait, but 6 + 3 = 9, which is more than 8. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents each contribute one carbon. But that can't be, because a carbonyl group is more than one carbon. Let me think differently. Maybe the substituents are a halogen (like Br, which doesn't add any carbons) and an oxygen-containing group, perhaps an ester or ketone.

Wait, another approach: the molecule must have a total of 8 carbons. So, the ring (6) plus substituents (2) = 8. So the substituents must together add up to two carbons. Oh, wait, but each substituent would have to be one carbon. Because 2 substituents each with one carbon: 2 total. So 6 + 2 = 8.

Hmm, but how can a substituent be a carbonyl group and contribute only one carbon? Because a carbonyl group is like CO, which requires at least another carbon. Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone where the carbonyl is part of the ring.

Wait, no, that would be a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached as a substituent. For example, a substituent like -CO- attached to the ring, but that's not possible because O is in the middle. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl as an acyl group, like -CO-R.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are -Cl and -O-CO-R, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a larger group. Let's think about the possible groups. Since the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe one of the substituents is a ketone, like an acetyl group (COCH3). That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3), but that's two carbons. Then, the other substituent is a halogen, which adds zero carbons. So substituents would be Cl and COCH3. That's 6 (ring) + 1 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 9 carbons. But the total is 8. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the substituents are each a single carbon, but that can't be for the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a group that has only one carbon attached. Wait, maybe it's a formyl group, which is -CHO. That's one carbon (the CHO has one carbon, the aldehyde). So substituent could be -CHO (1 carbon) and the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, 0 carbons). So together, substituents add 1 carbon. Then 6 +1 =7. No, but the total is 8. So that's not enough.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another structure. Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a methoxy group (OCH3), but that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group as in an ester or something else. Let me think of the possible structures. Let me think of the substituents. Since both substituents are attached to the ring, and we have a total of 8 carbons, perhaps one substituent is a Cl (no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group with one carbon. But I'm not sure such a substituent exists.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a larger ring. But that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons. For example, a propionyl group (but that's three carbons). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a methyl group. But the IR says carbonyl and aromatic-halogen. So, maybe the substituents are Cl and a ketone group, but perhaps in a way that the substituents add up to two carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone like -CO- attached to something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a side chain. Let's think of the substituent as -COOR, where R is an ethyl group, but that might add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a halogen and another substituent is a carbonyl group that's part of a ring. No, that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group with a single carbon, like a formyl group (-CHO). So substituents are -CHO and -Cl. So, substituents add 1 (CHO) +0 (Cl)=1 carbon. 6 +1=7. Doesn't reach 8.

Hmm. This is tricky.

Wait, another approach: the substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halogen, but perhaps the carbonyl is part of a larger structure attached to the ring. For example, a substituent like -COCH2Cl. But then the substituent would bring more than two carbons, which might complicate the count.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. Let's count the ring (6) + substituents (2). So substituents sum to 2 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon, but one substituent has a carbonyl.

Wait, no, perhaps both substituents together add two carbons. So substituent 1 is Cl (no C), substituent 2 is (CO) something with one C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is OCH3 (methoxy group, which is O with a CH3), but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. So that's probably not.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of an aromatic ring, but that's not possible. Alternatively, a substituent like -COOH (carboxylic acid), which would be two carbons (the COOH group). So substituents: -COOH (two C) and Cl (0 C). Then total substituents C: 2. 6 +2 =8. That fits.

So the structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COOH group attached. That would give a di-substituted benzene, with substituents Cl and COOH.

But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. A carboxylic acid has a strong carbonyl absorption around 1700 cm-1. Also, the phenolic O-H would have a broad peak around 2500-3300, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

But in any case, let's think about the NMR.

If the substituents are Cl and COOH, then the structure is something like Cl-C6H4-COOH. But wait, the di-substituted benzene would have substituents in the ortho, meta, or para positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a keto group. Let's suppose the substituent is a ketone, like a -COCH3 group attached to the ring. So substituents: Cl and COCH3. Then, substituent carbons: Cl (0) + COCH3 (2) = 2. So 6 + 2 =8, which fits.

So the structure would be benzene with substituents Cl and COCH3. Then, the positions would matter for the NMR.

Now, let's think about the NMR signals.

The COCH3 group would have a CH3 next to the carbonyl. The CH3 would typically show up around Î´ 2.1-2.6 as a singlet. Because the carbonyl is deshielding the CH3, and if the CH3 is attached directly to the carbonyl, it's usually a singlet because there are no neighboring protons.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

So a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. That would correspond to a CH3 group, possibly attached to a carbonyl. So this might fit the COCH3 substituent.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), which might be an aldehyde proton. But if we have a carbonyl like COCH3, we wouldn't have an aldehyde. So A might not fit.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are more typical for something like an ether or maybe an adjacent CH2 group. But not sure how that fits here.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), which could be a proton in a para-disubstituted ring. Or maybe a substituent that's causing some symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the structure I'm thinking is benzene with Cl and COCH3 substituents. Let's say they are in the para positions. Then, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. But if they're in the ortho positions, the ring protons would split differently.

Wait, but with substituents in the para position, the ring's remaining protons would be two sets of doublets. Each set would have two protons. So for example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite, so the ring would have two pairs of protons, each pair being equivalent, leading to two doublet peaks in the NMR.

So in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So in option C, that's exactly what we see: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents causing the ring protons to be in two different environments, each as two protons.

The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H would correspond to the CH3 in the COCH3 group.

So option C would fit this scenario.

But let me check the other options. Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is very deshielded. That would correspond to an aldehyde proton, but in our structure, we don't have an aldehyde. So A seems to be for a benzaldehyde derivative, which doesn't fit the substituents we have.

Option B has peaks around 4.8 and 4.6, which are more for something like an ether or adjacent CH2 groups. Maybe a di-substituted compound with two oxygen-containing groups, but that doesn't fit with the carbonyl and halogen substituents.

Option D has a 1H singlet at 6.9, which might be a proton in a meta position in a di-substituted benzene. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, going back: the substituents are Cl and COCH3. If they're para, the ring protons would have two doublets, as in option C. Alternatively, if they're meta, but that would complicate the splitting. But the option C NMR shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

But wait, another possibility: if the substituents are both in the para positions, but how would that affect the aromatic protons? Let's say, for example, we have Cl in position 1 and COCH3 in position 4. Then, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. The two protons adjacent to Cl would be one set, and the two protons adjacent to COCH3 would be another set. So that would lead to two doublets in the NMR.

Yes, so option C seems to fit. The aromatic protons would split into two doublets, and the COCH3's CH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm.

Wait, but what about the IR? The IR shows a carbonyl and a halogen. So the substituent with the carbonyl is present, and the Cl contributes to the C-Cl stretch in IR.

So putting it all together, the correct NMR should have two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet around 2.3 ppm for the CH3.

Looking at option C, that's exactly what's presented. So the answer should be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted six-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acetyl group (-COCH3). The total carbon count (8) is consistent with the benzene ring (6 carbons) and the substituents (-Cl contributes no carbons, and -COCH3 contributes 2 carbons).

The structure is likely para-substituted, with the halogen and the acetyl group in opposite positions. This arrangement results in two distinct environments for the aromatic protons, leading to two doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum. The acetyl group's CH3 will appear as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the substituents described (no aldehyde group is present).  
- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are typical for protons in ether or adjacent CH2 groups, which do not match the expected substituents.  
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene, and the singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) matches the CH3 group of the acetyl substituent. This option is consistent with the structure.  
- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single proton in a non-symmetrical environment, which does not align with the expected para-substitution pattern.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and an acetyl group.

Answer: C
