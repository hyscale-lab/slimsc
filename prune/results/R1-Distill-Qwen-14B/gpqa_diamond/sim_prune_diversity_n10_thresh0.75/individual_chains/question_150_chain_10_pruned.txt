Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, let's look at the given data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5. Oh wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO, so X (halogens) are zero. Let me recalculate: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. More likely, some rings and double bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm, triplet (1H). That's a triplet, so maybe adjacent to two protons. Could be an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the 9.72 is an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 ppm, doublet (2H). That suggests aromatic protons, possibly para-substituted because the doublet is two protons. Similarly, 6.51 ppm, another doublet (2H). This might be another set of aromatic protons, maybe adjacent to some substituent.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group. But since it's a singlet, two protons not split by neighboring Hs. Maybe a vinyl group with substituents or a di-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that make the protons equivalent.

3.66 ppm, doublet (2H). That could be a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, but in what context?

Putting this together, maybe the compound has two aromatic rings and an aldehyde group. The 9.72 ppm (aldehyde) suggests an aldehyde is present. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could be two pairs of aromatic protons, maybe on two benzene rings, each with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structure. So, considering it has two aromatic rings, maybe each ring has a substituent. The aldehyde is one group, and perhaps the other groups are substituents on the aromatic rings.

Wait, let's count the carbons. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes the aldehyde and other substituents.

Wait, maybe the compound is something like phenyl groups attached to a butyraldehyde or similar. Let me think. If there are two benzene rings, each attached to a chain that leads to an aldehyde, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a central chain with functional groups and two aryl substituents.

Looking at the NMR:

The 3.66 ppm doublet is 2H. So maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like OCH2. Wait, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.3-3.7 ppm. So maybe that's an OCH2 group attached to something else, like an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a conjugated system, like in an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde).

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 9.72 ppm, which is an aldehyde proton (1H). Since it's a triplet, it must be split by two neighboring protons. So the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group. Because a triplet arises from two adjacent protons. So the structure might be R-CH2-CHO. Wait, but that would make the aldehyde's proton a triplet only if the CH2 is adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like CH2=CH-CHO where the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond. Wait, but the proton on the double bond would be at a lower ppm, perhaps.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. That could be a di-substituted double bond, perhaps. Like a vinyl group. Because in a vinyl group, the protons are often around 5-6 ppm. But 6.27 is a bit high, but maybe near an electronegative group or in conjugation.

So, perhaps the structure is something like two aromatic rings connected via a chain that includes a double bond and an aldehyde group. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a dibenzalacetone derivative, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a resorcinol derivative with an aldehyde substituent.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group attached to oxygen. Like an OCH2CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring in which each substituent is a chain leading to an aldehyde. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a benzaldehyde with another substituent, such as a hydroxyl group and a side chain.

Wait, considering the NMR data, the aldehyde is at 9.72. Then, the aromatic protons are at 6.98 and 6.51. Let me think of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if one substituent is a group that deshields the protons, making them appear around 6.98 and 6.51.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm (2H, broad) could be a vinyl group, perhaps in conjugation with something else. Alternatively, it might be an enol tautomer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a dihydroxybenzene (like resorcinol) with a substituent chain that includes an aldehyde and a CH2O group.

Wait, considering the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me count the atoms. Each benzene ring has 6 carbons, but if there are two benzene rings, that's 12 carbons, which is way more than 8. So perhaps only one benzene ring.

Wait wait, no, wait. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons total. If there is one benzene ring (6 carbons), then the rest are 2 more carbons. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents that add up to 2 carbons, including functional groups.

But that seems a bit tight. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, but that would require more carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, let me recount: C8H9NO. So
