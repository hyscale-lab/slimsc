Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Let me think. The question says the electron is moving at speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE.

Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take the equality: Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

So, first I need to find Δp. Momentum p is mass times velocity. But here, we have an uncertainty in momentum, so Δp would probably be related to the uncertainty in velocity, but wait, in this problem, the electron is moving at speed v, but the problem states the uncertainty in space is Δx. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the uncertainty in momentum from the position uncertainty.

Wait, maybe I should compute Δp using the uncertainty principle. So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Oh, but since ħ is a small constant, maybe I can approximate it as Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), but I'll have to see.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the uncertainty in energy. Energy for a particle is given by its kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv². But wait, the uncertainty in energy would come from the uncertainty in momentum because E is related to p. Because E = p²/(2m). So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be found using the uncertainty in momentum Δp.

Wait, so if ΔE is the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m), then the uncertainty ΔE would be approximately (2Δp * p)/(2m) )? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me model this.

E = p²/(2m), so the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately (ΔE/E) ≈ 2*(Δp/p). So, ΔE ≈ 2*(Δp/p) * E
