Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams are used to represent interactions in quantum field theory, and the number of loops in the diagram relates to the order of the process. Each loop typically corresponds to a loop integral in the calculation, which comes from the perturbation expansion.

The question is about figuring out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the "size estimate" written next to it. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. 

Wait, I think each loop contributes a certain factor to the overall expression. I remember that each loop integral in four-dimensional spacetime typically brings in a factor of 1/(16 pi²) from the integration over the loop momentum. But wait, does that come in each loop, or per loop? Let me think. So, a Feynman diagram with L loops would have that factor raised to the Lth power? Or maybe it's multiplied each time.

Looking at the given expression: there's a term 1/(4 pi)^6. Let's compute that. So (4 pi)^6 is (4^6) * (pi^6). 4^6 is 4096, but I'm more concerned about the exponent on pi. But wait, the factor 1/(16 pi^2) comes from each loop in 4D. Because in four dimensions, integrating over each loop momentum gives a 1/(16 pi²) factor. So for each loop, you multiply by 1/(16 pi²), which is the same as (1/(4 pi))², because (4 pi)^2 is 16 pi². So (1/(4 pi))^2 per loop.

Wait, let me think again. Each loop contributes a factor of 1/(16 pi²). So for L loops, it's (1/(16 pi²))^L. But in the given expression, the term is (1/(4 pi))^6, which is the same as (1/(16 pi²))^3. Because (1/(4 pi))^6 = (1/(4 pi))^2 * (1/(4 pi))^2 * (1/(4 pi))^2 = (1/(16 pi²))^3. So that would imply that we have three loops, right? Because each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4 pi))^2, so three loops would give six in the denominator exponent, matching what's given.

So let's break it down. The term is 1/(4 pi)^6. Let's write that as (1/(4 pi))^6. We can also write this as (1/(4 pi))^2 raised to the 3rd power, so (1/(4 pi))^2 * three times. Since each loop gives a (1/(4 pi))^2 factor, three loops would give (1/(4 pi))^(2*3) = (1/(4 pi))^6. So that part suggests three loops.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the exact factors can vary depending on conventions. Let me think of some examples. For instance, a one-loop diagram would have (1/(1
