Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and fluorescent markers. Hmm, I remember that these kinds of experiments often involve vectors with certain regulatory elements and reporter genes. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The setup is that someone is studying a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under different promoters or regulatory elements.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor. But there are stop cassettes in between. The ligand has a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. Oh, I remember that loxP sites are used in recombination. Cre recombinase recognizes them and can delete the stop cassette, allowing the ORF to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, often used for constitutive expression. The receptor has an IRES element upstream. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be used for separate translation, especially if the first ORF is under a strong promoter. So the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor from the IRES, which might be a weaker promoter or just a way to allow for some expression after the ligand.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested with Western blot. But after transfecting into primary astrocytes, nothing showed up? Or wait, the question says that in the mouse model, they crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. So I think the Cre is used to excise the stop cassettes. Let me think about how this works.

In the vector, the ligand is first, then a stop with loxP. Then the receptor, with a stop with lox2272. So when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, the stop cassettes would be excised, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed as separate proteins, each with their fluorescent tags.

Wait, wait. The ligand is fused to mCherry, so when the stop is removed, the ligand should be expressed as ligand-mCherry. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed as receptor-eGFP. But in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So when they cross the mice, the Cre would be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, deleting the stop cassettes in those cells, leading to expression of ligand and receptor.

But in the question, the offspring are visualized under a confocal microscope, and they see no green signal. The eGFP is on the receptor. So the green signal would indicate the receptor-eGFP is expressed. But they didn't see it. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. So would that affect expression? I'm not sure. If the ligand is secreted, maybe it acts on neighboring cells, but the construct is about expression, not function. So maybe this isn't the main issue here.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So the protein isn't trafficking correctly. Could the stop cassette removal affect the correct processing? If the stop is still there, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but if the stop is removed, but the construct is not in frame, maybe. Wait, but the question is about the expression. If the eGFP isn't showing up, perhaps the receptor isn't being made. Or it's made but not fluorescent.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe the IRES is important for the receptor expression. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed first, and then the IRES translates the receptor. But the IRES might be dependent on the preceding ORF's termination. Alternatively, if the stop cassette is in the way, the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, the vector's structure: The ligand is first, with a stop in a loxP cassette. Then the receptor is next, with a stop in a lox2272 cassette.

When Cre is present, it would delete the loxP and
