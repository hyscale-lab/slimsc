Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, the setup is that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ|² dx over that region. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the probability of finding the particle in that interval must be 1. And the probability outside should be zero, but wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. The modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, let me think. The wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. That's because |ψ|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))².

So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Now, the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1 because that's the total probability.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function must be normalizable. So the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 should be 1. Because the problem states that when we measure, all the particles are found between 1 and 3. So the
