Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

The system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy E is given by -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins.

Wait, I need to find all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the energy for each. Then, sum exp(-β E) for each configuration.

First, how many possible states are there? Each spin has 2 possibilities, so 2^3=8 states. Let me list them all.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all. Because each term in the energy is S_i S_j, which is +1 if both are same, -1 if different.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the number of neighboring pairs with the same spin. Because each S_i S_j term is 1 if same, -1 otherwise.

Wait, the energy E is -J times the sum of these terms. So, E = -J [n], where n is the sum of S_i S_j for each pair. Each term contributes either 1 or -1.

So the energy depends on how many pairs are aligned (same spin) versus anti-aligned.

Wait, but each pair contributes to the sum. Let me think about possible values of the sum n.

The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is +1 or -1.

What are the possible values of n?

I can think about all possible cases.

Wait, let's consider all possible configurations:

Each spin is +1 or -1. Let me consider all 8 possibilities.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   Then each product is +1. So n=1+1+1=3. E = -J *3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. So n= 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. n= -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. n= -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. n= -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. n= -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. n= 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   Each product is +1. n=3. E= -J*3.

Wait, so let me count how many configurations have each n.

n=3 occurs for cases 1 and 8. So two configurations.

n=-1 occurs for cases 2-7. That's 6 configurations.

Wait, wait, wait! No, looking back, cases 2,3,4,5,6,7 are all n=-1. So 6 configurations with n=-1.

So the energy E is:

For n=3: E = -3J.

For n=-1: E = J.

So each configuration contributes to the partition function as exp(β E), since Z is sum exp(-beta E), wait no: wait, E is given, so the Boltzmann factor is exp(-beta E). Wait, beta is 1/(kT), so exp(-E/(kT)) = exp(-beta E).

Wait, in the problem, E is given as E = -J [ ... ], so let me plug in:

For n=3: E = -3J. So exp(-beta * (-3J)) = exp(3J beta).

For n=-1: E = J. So exp(-beta * J) = exp(-J beta).

So each configuration contributes a term of exp(3J beta) or exp(-J beta).

So the partition function Z is:

Z = [number of states with E=-3J] * exp(3 J beta) + [number of states with E=J] * exp(-J beta)

From earlier, 2 states have E=-3J, and 6 states have E=J.

So Z = 2 exp(3 J beta) + 6 exp(- J beta).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ) → No, because for E=-3J, we have exp(3Jβ), not negative.

Option B: 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ) → Yes, that's what I have.

Option C: 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ) → No, exponents are different.

Option D: 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ) → No.

So the correct answer would be option B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by analyzing the energy of the system. The energy is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1 / (kT) \). Since there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins, we enumerate all configurations and calculate the corresponding energy for each.

### Step 1: Analyze the energy
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), where each term \( S_i S_j \) is \( +1 \) if the spins are aligned and \( -1 \) if they are anti-aligned. The possible values of the sum are:

- \( n = 3 \): All three pairs are aligned (e.g., \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \) or \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \)).
- \( n = -1 \): Two pairs are anti-aligned, and one pair is aligned (all other configurations).

Thus, the energy for each case is:

- For \( n = 3 \): \( E = -3J \).
- For \( n = -1 \): \( E = J \).

### Step 2: Count the number of states for each energy
- There are **2 states** with \( n = 3 \) (all spins aligned: \( +1, +1, +1 \) or \( -1, -1, -1 \)).
- There are **6 states** with \( n = -1 \) (all other configurations).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:

\[
Z = \left( \text{Number of states with } n = 3 \right) e^{-\beta E_{n=3}} + \left( \text{Number of states with } n = -1 \right) e^{-\beta E_{n=-1}}.
\]

Substituting the energies:

- For \( n = 3 \): \( E = -3J \), so \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( n = -1 \): \( E = J \), so \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus:

\[
Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 e^{-3J\beta} + 6 e^{J\beta} \) → Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 e^{3J\beta} + 6 e^{-J\beta} \) → Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 e^{2J\beta} + 6 e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, exponents are different.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 e^{2J\beta} + 2 e^{-2J\beta} \) → Incorrect, coefficients and exponents are wrong.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{B}
