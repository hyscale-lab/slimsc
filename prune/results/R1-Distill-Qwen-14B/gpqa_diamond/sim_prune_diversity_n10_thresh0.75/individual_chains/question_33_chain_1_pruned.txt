Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let me think this through.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. The product is supposed to be the exo product of a [4+2] cycloaddition. I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. Oh wait, but waitâ€”wait, furan-2,5-dione is a dienophile, right? Because it's an electron-deficient molecule, with the two ketone groups. And 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a diene. So yeah, this looks like a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene and a dienophile.

So the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. The 2 and 5 positions are substituted with methyl groups. So in the structure, the diene would be the conjugated double bonds between carbons 2 and 3, and 4 and 5, right? Wait, no, thiophene has two double bonds. The positions are 2 and 3, and 5 and 6? Wait no, wait, thiophene is 1,3,5 positions around the ring. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with S in position 1, then double bonds between 1-2, 3-4. Or wait, no, the structure is S in one corner, and the double bonds are between 2-3 and 4-5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps 2,5-dimethylthiophene has methyl groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, okay, maybe that's not so crucial right now.

In any case, the diene is 2,5-dimethylthiophene. So the Diels-Alder reaction would form a six-membered ring, with the diene attacking the dienophile. The dienophile is furan-2,5-dione, which has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So that
