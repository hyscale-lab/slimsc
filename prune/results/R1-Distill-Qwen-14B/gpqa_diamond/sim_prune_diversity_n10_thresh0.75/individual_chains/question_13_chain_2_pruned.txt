Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. Hmm, I remember Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, a bicyclic monoterpene, right? Its structure is a bicyclic compound with a specific stereochemistry. The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene, which I think is the natural form found in citrus peels.

The first step is the reaction with Pd/C under hydrogen. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, Limonene has double bonds. Since Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, it's got a structure with a double bond in the ring, maybe in a cyclohexene system. Hydrogenation of a double bond would add hydrogen across it, turning it into a single bond. Wait, but how many double bonds does Limonene have? I think it has one double bond in the ring, perhaps in a cyclohexene structure. So, when hydrogenated, that double bond would become a single bond, making it cyclohexane.

Wait, but the question says after stirring with Pd/C under hydrogen, one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So, that suggests that one mole of H2 is used per mole of Limonene. Since Limonene has one double bond, adding H2 across that would produce cyclohexane. So, product 1 would be the hydrogenated form of Limonene, which would be (R)-Limonane? Or maybe it's a different structure. Wait, no—Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and hydrogenation would saturate the double bond.

Wait, the structure of Limonene is (R)-configuration. So when hydrogenated, the stereochemistry might change, but actually, when hydrogenating a double bond, the stereochemistry of the resulting substituents would be determined by the catalyst. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and under hydrogen, the addition would be syn. Oh, but limonene has a specific structure—so perhaps the hydrogenation converts the double bond into a single bond, changing the ring structure.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Limonene is a bicyclic compound, like menthene. Its structure is a
