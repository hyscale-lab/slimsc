Okay, so I've got this problem about a star with some dark spots and how it affects the observed brightness. The question is asking about the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, when the star rotates, these spots come into view and change the overall brightness we observe. But if there were an exoplanet causing the same signal, what would its size be?

Wait, I remember that the brightness variation (the depth of the dip in the light curve) depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. Also, the planet would block some of the star's light as it transits. But wait, the spots are on the star, so the effect is when they're on the side facing us. So the light variation is due to the spots being cooler and dimming the star when they are in the visible hemisphere.

Wait, but the question is about a hypothetical exoplanet. So, we need to compare the signal from the planet blocking starlight to the signal from the spots. So, the spot effect is not a transit but a brightness variation because the spots are cooler.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, for the exoplanet case, the dip is when the planet blocks part of the star's light, so the depth is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star.

In the case of the star spots: when the star rotates, the spots come into view. But since the spots are dark, they make the total brightness dip as the spots rotate into the visible hemisphere. So the dip in brightness is due to the spots being cooler and thus emitting less light.

But wait, the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So when the spots are on the visible side, the brightness decreases because the spots are cooler. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation (the dip) would be similar to that caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, no, actually, in the planet case, the dip is when the planet blocks some of the star
