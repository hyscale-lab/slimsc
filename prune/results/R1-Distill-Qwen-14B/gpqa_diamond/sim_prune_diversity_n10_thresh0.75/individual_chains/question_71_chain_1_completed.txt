Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. Since the problem states that all planets have the same albedo, that part should be easy.

The question is about the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so the periods are in that order for the planets. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has 2*P1, and so on.

I think the key here is to find the ratio of their distances from the star because the equilibrium temperature depends on that. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * (L/(16πσD^2))^½, but wait, I might be mixing some terms. Alternatively, I remember the formula as T = T_eff * (R / (2a)) )^n, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, another way to think is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but that's assuming they're in the same system with the same star.

Wait, no, the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The law states that (P^2) is proportional to (a^3) / (M_star), but since the star's mass is the same for all planets, P^2 is proportional to a^3. So, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Right, so the semi-major axis (distance from star) a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). So if Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 * P1, and Planet_2 has 2 * P1, their distances are a4 = (3.5 P1)^(2/3), a2 = (2 P1)^(2/3). 

So the ratio of the distances a4 / a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me calculate that. 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5 / 2 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, what's that numerically?

Wait, 7/4 is 1.75. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 (since 1.2^3 is about 1.728), so 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.205. Then squaring that, (1.205)^2 ≈ 1.452. So a4 is about 1.452 times a2. 

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet radiates from a sphere, so the energy balance gives T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2).

Wait, let me be precise. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A)/ (2(1 + e)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 AU ) / a )^(1/2 ), assuming circular orbit (e=0) and A is albedo. So since all planets have same A and same star, the T ratio would be sqrt( a2 / a4 ), because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 )

Alternatively, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T_ratio = (a2 / a4 )^(-1/2) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), then T4 / T2 = (1/sqrt(a4)) / (1/sqrt(a2)) ) = sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a4) )= sqrt( a2 /a4 ) .

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a4) ) 

We have a4 = (3.5 P1)^(2/3), a2 = (2 P1)^(2/3). So a4 / a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) ≈ (1.75)^(0.6667).

Wait, earlier I calculated a4/a2 as approx 1.452. So a2/a4 is 1/1.452 ≈ 0.687.

So sqrt(0.687) is about 0.829. So T4 / T2 is approximately 0.829. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid mistakes. Let's compute a4/a2 again.

Compute (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let me compute 1.75^(1/3) first. The cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2009. Then squaring that gives (1.2009)^2 ≈ 1.442.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.442. Therefore, a2/a4 = 1/1.442 ≈ 0.694.

So T4 / T2 = sqrt(0.694) ≈ 0.833.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which aligns with this calculation.

Wait, but wait another thing—the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So for Planet_2, period is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5.

Alternatively, a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2 = (2)^(2/3), a4 = (3.5)^(2/3). So their ratio a4/a2 is (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3).

Let me compute this more accurately. 7/4 is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3).

I can compute 1.75^(1/3) more accurately. Let's see, 1.75 is 7/4. Cube of 1.2 is 1.728, as noted. 1.2^3 = 1.728. 1.21^3 = approx 1.771. Wait, 1.21 * 1.21 = 1.4641, times 1.21 is about 1.772. So 1.75 is between 1.2^3 and 1.21^3. Let's approximate.

Difference between 1.728 and 1.772 is about 0.044. We have 1.75 is 0.022 above 1.728. So roughly, 1.2 + (0.022/0.044)*0.01) = 1.2 + 0.005 = 1.205. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.205.

Then, (1.205)^2 is approximately 1.452. So a4/a2 = 1.452.

So a2/a4 = 1/1.452 ≈ 0.688. So sqrt(0.688) is approximately sqrt(0.6889) which is 0.83. So yes, the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law: \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_2^{2/3}}{P_4^{2/3}}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

From the problem, the orbital periods are in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \). For Planet_2 and Planet_4, the periods are \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \):  
- \( \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \),  
- The cube root of \( 0.571 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \( T_4 / T_2 \) is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83.**
