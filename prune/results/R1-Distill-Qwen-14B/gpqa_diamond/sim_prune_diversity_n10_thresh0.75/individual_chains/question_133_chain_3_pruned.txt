Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights (Mw) are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

I'm a bit rusty on buffer solutions, but I think this is a buffer problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but wait—phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The salts provided are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Hmmm.

Let me recall: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissociates in water, it gives H2PO4^- and K+. Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is Na2HPO4, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- by the second dissociation of H3PO4. So H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1), H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3). So, in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gain a proton to become H3PO4), but since H3PO4 is a stronger acid (Ka1 is 7.5e-3, which is larger than Ka2 and Ka3), but in this problem, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the solution contains H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. So this forms a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Or is it another pair? Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the species present.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. But PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of H3PO4, which has a very small Ka (1.8e-12). So under normal circumstances, PO4^3- is not going
