Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The problem is about their elemental abundances.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh wait, the brackets mean logarithmic abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, I should remember the formula: [X/Y] = log10 (n_X / n_Y) - log10 (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the solar ratio.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So wait, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5? That would mean log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7, so log is -5, nMg/nH is 10^-5.

Wait, but maybe I should write this down more clearly.

For the Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 --> nFe/nH_sun = 10^-4.5
log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 --> nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5

So in the Sun, the ratio of Fe to H is 1e-4.5, and Mg to H is 1e-5.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2, so [Si/Star1] / [Si/Star2]?
