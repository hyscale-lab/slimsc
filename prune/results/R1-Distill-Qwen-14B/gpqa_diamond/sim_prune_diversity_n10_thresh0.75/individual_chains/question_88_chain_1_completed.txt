Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and the immune response. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain gene, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to pathogens are initiated. Rotavirus is a pathogen that causes gastroenteritis, so it makes sense it's being studied in the gut.

So, the GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. When they're given orally, some are destroyed by stomach acid (which probably breaks down proteins), but some manage to get through and reach the secondary lymphoid organsâ€”like Peyer patches. Those that reach the Peyer patches would be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells or M cells.

In the Peyer patches, the immune system would respond by activating B cells. The variable heavy chain gene's high variability suggests that something is causing diversity in the B cell receptors. 

Wait, the options are about different processes. Let me think about each one:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process where B cells mutate their variable regions after activation, leading to more diverse antibodies. This happens during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers where B cells proliferate and mutate.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, involves the complement system binding to pathogens and marking them for destruction. Not directly related to the variability in the variable region.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when B cells change the class of antibody they produce (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't directly affect the variability of the variable regions; it's more about the type of antibody.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the process during B cell development where V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments are rearranged to create the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens in the bone marrow for B cells, but the question is about an immune response after exposure.

Wait, but in the question, the high variability is observed in the variable heavy chain after the immune response. Somatic hypermutation occurs during the immune response, after the initial exposure, leading to more diverse antibodies. So if the B cells are proliferating and their variable regions are changing, that must be somatic hypermutation.

The process that's causing the variability in the variable chain after the initial B cell development would be somatic hypermutation. So the answer should be A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but the remaining proteins reach the Peyer patches, where the variable heavy chain gene in the proliferating cell population shows high variability. The task is to identify the process responsible for this variability.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and serve as sites for initiating immune responses to gut pathogens like rotavirus. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors after antigen exposure. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells mutate their variable regions to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions of B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variability of the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged. However, the question describes variability observed after antigen exposure, which is not consistent with VDJ recombination.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs during the immune response and increases diversity in B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
