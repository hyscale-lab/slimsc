Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So this is in two dimensions, right? Because there's dx and dy. Oh, wait, but pseudospheres are usually in higher dimensions. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, a pseudosphere could refer to a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure. Let me think. Or maybe in this context, it's a two-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but perhaps the metric itself is two-dimensional.

Wait, the metric is written in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a two-dimensional surface. Hmm. So the question is about the area of this pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbolic surface. The metric for a pseudosphere in 2D is usually given in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = (2r/(r² - x² - y²))² (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure about the exact coefficients.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me compare this to the standard Poincaré disk metric. The standard one for a radius R would be something like ds² = (4R²)/(R² - r²)² (dr² + r² dθ²), but maybe that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, in some sources, the metric is written as ds² = (2R/(R² - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate.

Wait, maybe I should think about the given metric. Let me compute the factors. If I have ds² = (32)/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), can I write this as (something)^2 times (dx² + dy²) to match the Poincaré form?

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk metric is usually ds² = (4R²)/(R² - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but perhaps in Cartesian coordinates (x, y), it's expressed differently. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature to determine if this is a pseudosphere.

I remember that for a metric in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be computed, and for a pseudosphere, it should be a constant negative value. The Gaussian curvature K is related to the metric components. For a metric ds² = A(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²), the curvature is given by K = - (1/(2A²)) * Laplacian(A), or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for curvature in isothermal coordinates.

Wait, more accurately, the formula for Gaussian curvature K when the metric is ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function, is K = - (1/(2E)) * (E_xx + E_yy). Let me try that.

So in our case, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So E = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

So E is a function of r². Let me compute E_xx and E_yy. Since E is symmetric in x and y, the derivatives will be similar.

Compute the partial derivatives.

E = 32 (4 - r²)^{-1} = 32 (4 - x² - y²)^{-1}.

E_x = partial derivative with respect to x: E_x = 32 * (-1) * (4 - x² - y²)^{-2} * (-2x) ) = 32 * 2x (4 - x² - y²)^{-2} = 64x / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Similarly, E_y = 64y / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Now, E_xx is the second derivative with respect to x.

E_x = 64x (4 - r²)^{-2}.

So E_xx = 64 [ (4 - r²)^{-2} + x * 2 (4 - r²)^{-3} (2x) ) ].

Wait, wait, let me compute it more carefully.

d/dx of E_x: E_x = 64x (4 - r²)^{-2}.

So E_xx = 64 * ( (4 - r²)^{-2} ) + 64x * d/dx [ (4 - r²)^{-2} ].

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} with respect to x is -2*(4 - r²)^{-3} * (-2x) = 4x (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So E_xx = 64*(4 - r²)^{-2} + 64x * 4x (4 - r²)^{-3}.

Similarly, E_yy = 64*(4 - r²)^{-2} + 64y * 4y (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So E_xx + E_yy = 64*(4 - r²)^{-2} [1 + 1] + 64 * [4x² + 4y²]/(4 - r²)^3.

Wait, let me compute each term.

First, E_xx = 64/(4 - r²)^2 + (64 * 4 x²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Similarly, E_yy = 64/(4 - r²)^2 + (64 *4 y²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Adding them together:

E_xx + E_yy = 128/(4 - r²)^2 + (64*4)(x² + y²)/(4 - r²)^3.

But x² + y² = r².

So E_xx + E_yy = 128/(4 - r²)^2 + (256 r²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Factor out 128/(4 - r²)^3:

Wait, let's factor 128/(4 - r²)^3. Let me see:

128/(4 - r²)^2 = 128 (4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

So 128/(4 - r²)^2 = 128 (4 - r²) / (4 - r²)^3 = (128 (4 - r²)) / (4 - r²)^3 = 128/(4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write both terms over the same denominator.

E_xx + E_yy = [128 (4 - r²) + 256 r² ] / (4 - r²)^3.

Let me compute the numerator:

128 (4 - r²) + 256 r² = 128*4 - 128 r² + 256 r² = 512 + 128 r².

So E_xx + E_yy = (512 + 128 r²) / (4 - r²)^3.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2E)) * (E_xx + E_yy).

E is 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2E) is (4 - r²)/(64).

So K = - ( (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (512 + 128 r²)/(4 - r²)^3 )

Simplify:

The (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 1/(64) * (512 + 128 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Factor 128 out from numerator:

512 + 128 r² = 128(4 + r²).

So K = - (128 (4 + r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) )

Simplify 128 /64 = 2.

So K = - 2 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Wait, but for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be a negative constant, right? Because a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. But here, K depends on r, the radial coordinate. That suggests that this metric isn't a pseudosphere, unless perhaps the expression simplifies to a constant.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because if it's a pseudosphere, K should be constant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing E_xx + E_yy. Let me go back.

Wait, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So E = 32 (4 - r²)^{-1}.

Then E_x = 32 * (-1) * (-2x) (4 - r²)^{-2} = 64 x (4 - r²)^{-2}.

E_xx is the derivative of E_x with respect to x.

E_x = 64x (4 - r²)^{-2}.

So the derivative is 64 (4 - r²)^{-2} + 64x * derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} with respect to x.

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} with respect to x is (-2)(4 - r²)^{-3} * (-2x) )= 4x (4 - r²)^{-3}.

So E_xx = 64 (4 - r²)^{-2} + 64x * 4x (4 - r²)^{-3}.

Which is 64/(4 - r²)^2 + 256 x²/(4 - r²)^3.

Similarly, E_yy = 64/(4 - r²)^2 + 256 y²/(4 - r²)^3.

So E_xx + E_yy = 128/(4 - r²)^2 + 256 (x² + y²)/(4 - r²)^3.

But x² + y² = r², so:

E_xx + E_yy = 128/(4 - r²)^2 + 256 r²/(4 - r²)^3.

Now, factor out 128/(4 - r²)^3:

= [128 (4 - r²) + 256 r^2 ] / (4 - r²)^3.

Compute numerator:

128*(4) = 512, 128*(-r²) + 256 r² = 128 r².

So numerator is 512 + 128 r².

So E_xx + E_yy = (512 + 128 r²)/(4 - r²)^3.

Now, K = - (1/(2E)) (E_xx + E_yy).

E = 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2E) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) * (512 + 128 r²)/(4 - r²)^3 ) ]

Simplify:

The (4 - r²) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 1/(64) * (512 + 128 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Factor numerator: 512 + 128 r² = 128(4 + r²).

So,

K = - [ 128(4 + r²) ) / (64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ] 

Simplify 128/64 = 2,

K = - [ 2 (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Hmm, this is K = - 2(4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, isn't this dependent on r², which is the radial coordinate? But a pseudosphere should have constant curvature. So that suggests that this isn't a pseudosphere, but maybe a different kind of surface. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider another approach. Perhaps the given metric represents a two-dimensional space embedded in higher dimensions, but the question is about the area. Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2.

Wait, the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. Wait, no, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and it's an infinite surface. So its area would be infinite. But why is that?

Wait, another thought. Maybe the metric given is similar to the metric of a sphere, except that the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which suggests a different curvature.

Wait, the standard metric for a sphere in 2D is ds² = (R²/(R² - r²)) (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y², assuming it's the Poincaré disk model. But wait, no, that's for hyperbolic space. The sphere in 3D has a different metric. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

In this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) )? Wait, no, because the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², but since it's 2D and the off-diagonal terms are zero, the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy}.

Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor in 2D is usually written as:

[ g_{xx}      g_{xy}     ]

[ g_{yx}      g_{yy}     ]

In our case, the metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²), so g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_{yy} = same as g_{xx}, and g_{xy} = 0.

So the determinant g is g_{xx} * g_{yy} = (32/(4 - r²))^2, where r² = x² + y².

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, but wait, in 2D, sqrt(g) is the square root of the determinant, which would be (32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, no, the square root of (32/(4 - r²))² is 32/(4 - r²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So to find the total area, we need to integrate dA over the region where the denominator is positive. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 (since 4=2²).

So the total area would be the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's switch to polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area is 32 * ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ) ] dr dθ.

The θ integral is 2π.

So area = 32 * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to 2:

At r=2, u=4 -4=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity. But wait, when r approaches 2, u approaches 0, so ln(u) approaches negative infinity.

Wait, but let's compute the definite integral.

∫ from 0 to 2 of [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = [ (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) ] from 0 to 2.

At r=2, ln(0) → -infty.

But at r approaching 2 from below, 4 - r² approaches 0 from positive.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ].

ln(0) is -infty, so the expression becomes (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln(4) ) ] → (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty.

Wait, but ∫ from 0 to 2 of r/(4 - r²) dr diverges to negative infinity, because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches 0, and the integrand behaves like r/(4 - r²) ≈ 2/(4- (2)^2 + ... ) which is like 2/(epsilon), so the integral goes to positive infinity, but with the substitution, we have the integral becoming (-1/2)( ln(0) - ln(4) ) → (-1/2)(-infty - ln4 ) → (-1/2)(-infty) → +infty.

Wait, but wait: the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2 is actually divergent because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, and the integrand becomes very large positive (since 4 - r² approaches 0 from positive as r approaches 2 from below). So the integral is ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫0^2 [ - ( -r/(r² -4) ) ] dr, which is positive because denominator is negative beyond r=2, but up to r=2, denominator is positive.

Wait, maybe I should re-express it.

Wait, 4 - r² = (2 - r)(2 + r). As r approaches 2 from below, 4-r² approaches 0 from the positive side.

So the integrand r/(4 - r^2) becomes positive, and as r approaches 2, it goes to positive infinity. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr will be a positive infinity.

So the area is 32 * 2π * [ ∫0^2 r/(4 - r²) dr ].

Which is 64 π * [ ∞ ] = ∞.

So the area is infinite. Therefore, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D is +infty.

So the area is infinite because when integrating the area element, the integral diverges as r approaches 2, the boundary of the domain.

So the correct answer should be D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a two-dimensional surface. To determine the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we compute the total area by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in this metric is derived from the determinant of the metric tensor, which is:

\[
\sqrt{g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int \int \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the integral becomes:

\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), leaving:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{4}^{0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln|u|\right]_{4}^{0}.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), so:

\[
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right] = \infty.
\]

Thus, the total area diverges to infinity. This is consistent with the fact that a pseudosphere of constant negative curvature is an infinite surface. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is:

\[
A = +\infty.
\]
