Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic moments. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin aligned along certain axes, and when the magnetic field changes, their behavior changes too.

So the setup is: initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. Oh wait, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, right? And Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz. 

The particle is in a magnetic field pointing in +Z. So the Hamiltonian for that situation would be H_initial = -mu · B. Wait, no, more accurately, the energy is given by H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma * S_z * B. But wait, the sign depends on the direction of the magnetic field. Since B is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B * S_z. 

Wait, but when the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian would be zero, right? Because the magnetic moment's interaction with the field is gone. But then another magnetic field is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * S_y * B? Or wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, but when the field is along Y, the interaction would be in the Y direction. So H = -mu · B = -gamma * (S · B). So since B is along Y, H = -gamma * B * S_y.

Wait, but wait a second. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma * S_z. But when the field is in the Y direction, the magnetic moment would interact with the B field along Y. So the Hamiltonian in the new situation is H = -mu · B = - (gamma * S_z) · (B * Y-direction unit vector). Wait, that would make H = -gamma * B * (S_z * Y-direction component), but that's not quite right because S_z is along Z and the B is along Y. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, that's a bit unusual because normally the
