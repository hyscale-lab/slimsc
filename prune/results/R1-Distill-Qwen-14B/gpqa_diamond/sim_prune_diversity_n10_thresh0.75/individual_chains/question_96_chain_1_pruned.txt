Okay, so I've got this problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, each with different powers of ten.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. I think the formula is something like S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, A is the area of the event horizon, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant. Oh wait, I've heard it called the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Right.

So the entropy depends on the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so the area A is 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, I don't have the mass directly. Instead, I have the angular size and the distance. Maybe I can find the size of the event horizon using those.

Angular size θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians because the formulas usually use radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 * π/(180).

Wait, but how does θ relate to the size of the event horizon? Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ r / d, where r is the size of the object and d is the distance to it. That's the small angle approximation, assuming θ is very small, which it is here because it's 1e-17 degrees. So r ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is that the angular diameter θ is about (2r)/d. Because the event horizon has a diameter of 2r, so the angular size is (2r/d
