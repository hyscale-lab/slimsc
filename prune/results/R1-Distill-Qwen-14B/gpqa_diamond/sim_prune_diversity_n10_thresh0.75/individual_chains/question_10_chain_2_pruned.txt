Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are labeled A to D. Let me break down each option.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each planet, I need to calculate their density and compare.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm続. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. So option a's density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続. Wait, wait. Wait a minute, the density is given as 5.5. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because if the planet's density is 5.5, that's the same as Earth's. But it's twice as massive. Oh wait, but density is mass over volume. If mass increases and density stays the same, volume must also increase. So for a planet twice Earth's mass but same density, it would have a larger radius. But the question is asking about which has the highest density, so regardless of mass, density is given as 5.5. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition as Earth. So Earth's composition is mostly rock and metal, right? So for such a planet, with same composition, the density should be same as Earth's. Because composition affects density. So if it's 5 times more massive but same composition, then its density is also 5.5 g/cm続. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition. So same density as Earth, 5.5 g/cm続. So option d's density is 5.5.

Wait, wait, but wait. The question is which has the highest density. All of a, b, c, d have the same density? That can't be right. Because I might be missing something.

Wait, let me double-check. For option b, the question says the planet has
