Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think this through. The question has three parts (A, B, C), and each involves a Michael addition. I need to figure out the products for each and then match them to the options given.

First, I'll take each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, sodium ethoxide is a base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, Michael addition is when a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, in this case, which is the nucleophile and which is the electrophile?

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, it forms a strong nucleophilic enolate. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the other molecule, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the CH2, so it's actually CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but in the E configuration. Wait, wait, no. The actual structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, that's not right because the numbering would make the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name would be (E)-3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate methyl ester. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, in E configuration. Wait no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so for prop-2-enoate, the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, prop-2-enoate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate, the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. But that's not possible because that would make it a ketone, not an ester. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the C3. Wait, no, prop-2-enoate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 of the propenoate. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, with the E configuration. So the double bond is CH2-CH2, but with substituents on each end. Wait, no, the double bond is between C2 and C3 of propenoate. So the structure is CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should draw it out.

So, for (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
