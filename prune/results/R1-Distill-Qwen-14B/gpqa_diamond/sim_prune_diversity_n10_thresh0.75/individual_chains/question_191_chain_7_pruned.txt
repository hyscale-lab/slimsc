Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me see what the question says. Hmm, it's a multi-step synthesis, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. 

Alright, let's break it down step by step. The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me draw this structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So that's CH2=C(CH3)-.

So the starting molecule is a cyclohexanone ring with an OHCH2 group at C3 and a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group at C5? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-) but wait, no, the formula is CH2=C(CH3)- because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)= because the position is 1-en-2-yl. Wait, maybe it's (CH2CH2C) but I'm getting confused. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl group. The structure would be CH2=C(CH2-)- as the substituent? No, wait, the substituent is at the 2 position of propene. So propene is CH2=CHCH3. If we take the 2 position, so the group is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CHCH2- attached via the C2? Wait, no, the substituent is as a substituent on the ring. So for prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2=C(CH2-) but that's not right. Let me think again. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is
