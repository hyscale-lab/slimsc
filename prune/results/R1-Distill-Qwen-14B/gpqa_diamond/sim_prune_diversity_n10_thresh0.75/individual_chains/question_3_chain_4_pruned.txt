Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and spin operators. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx, and the options are given.

Hmm, expectation value. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is found by taking the bra-ket of the state with the operator applied. So, ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ where O is the operator.

Since the operator is a sum, maybe I can split the expectation value into parts. So for 10σz +5σx, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes sense because expectation values are linear, right? So I can compute each part separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is already expressed in terms of σz eigenstates, this should be straightforward. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. The eigenvalues for σz in |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are +1 and -1, respectively.

Wait, wait. No, wait. I think σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So when calculating ⟨σz⟩, each coefficient squared gives the probability, and then multiplied by the eigenvalue.

So the expectation value of σz is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that. (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

So then, 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly use the given state's coefficients. I'll need to find the expectation value the long way.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, I can write the state as a vector and compute the expectation value.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this in vector form. |↑⟩ is [1, 0] and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, more accurately, it's ψ^dagger multiplied by σx multiplied by ψ. So compute ψ^T σx ψ.

So let's compute it step by step. Let me write σx as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

First, multiply σx with ψ. Let's see, σx * ψ = [ (0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2)), (1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2)) ]^T → [√3/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, multiply ψ^T with this result. So ψ^T is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. The product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*(√
