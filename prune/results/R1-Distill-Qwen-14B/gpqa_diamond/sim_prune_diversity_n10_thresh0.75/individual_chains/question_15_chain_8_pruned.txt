Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've used the RV method, so they know the minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star, right?

Also, both have circular orbits, which is important because eccentricity affects the transit probability. Circular orbits might mean the probability is calculated more straightforwardly. 

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because a more massive star usually is larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size as Planet_2's. 

Wait, but what determines the probability of a transit? I remember that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbital plane to our line of sight. The formula I think is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (something?), where a_planet is the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, which determines the chance that the planet's path will cross our line of sight.

The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1 / (e * sqrt(1-e^2))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that part goes to zero, so maybe it's just (R_star / a). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) because the area where the planet can be aligned to transit is a function of that ratio. So if R_star is the same for both stars (since they have the same radius), but their a (semi-major axes) are different, then the transit probability depends on the a.

But wait, a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a³ = (G(M_star + M_planet) * P²)/(4π²). Since the mass
