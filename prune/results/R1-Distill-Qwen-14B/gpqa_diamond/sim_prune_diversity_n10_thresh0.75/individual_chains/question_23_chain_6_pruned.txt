Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked with TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are the products.

Hmm, so first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down.

But-3-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-... wait no, wait, butenyl. Let me make sure. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? Wait no, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but the numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's actually but-1-en-3-yl? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but has only four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? That doesn't make sense because that would be a four-carbon chain, so numbering goes 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4, but that's the same as between 2 and 3 if we count from the other end. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps
