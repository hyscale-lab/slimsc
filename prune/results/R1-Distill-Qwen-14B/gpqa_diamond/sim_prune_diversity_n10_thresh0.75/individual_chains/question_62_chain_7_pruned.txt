Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis questions can be tricky. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and another group that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which I think is like a CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a formyl (CHO) group attached.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH). So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's more like cyclohexane with a -C≡C-H group attached. So, it's cyclohexane connected to a carbon that's triple bonded to another carbon (which is just a CH group).

I need to figure out the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let me think about the possible reactions.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is CH(OH)-cyclohexyl. So that substituent must have been formed from some kind of addition across the triple bond perhaps. Also, the aldehyde group must come from somewhere—maybe oxidation.

Let me consider the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reagents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, methyl chloride as CH3Cl would be for alkylation. Wait, NaNH2 is often used in dehydrohalogenation, but with methyl chloride? Or maybe it's a Birch reduction or something else.

Wait, perhaps the first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, no, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is an alkyne.

Wait, maybe the first step is some kind of deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's for elimination. But if I have ethynylcyclohexane, adding NaNH2 and methyl chloride—maybe an alkylation. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. So perhaps it's doing a deprotonation and alkylation to form a longer chain. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is already an alkyne; maybe adding a methyl group via an SN2 mechanism? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form a strong base, then methyl chloride could add a methyl group. But I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is used in the formation of Grignard reagents or for elimination. Wait, another thought: perhaps the first step is to convert the terminal alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) into a more substituted alkyne. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. So the alkyne is terminal.

If we treat a terminal alkyne with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps it abstracts a proton, creating a strong base, which could then react with methyl chloride. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation
