Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star from Earth, its brightness changes periodically as it rotates. This setup can mimic the presence of an exoplanet, causing dips in brightness when the planet transits in front of the star.

The main question is: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? But wait, the catch is that the star isn't actually covered by spots, so I think we're comparing the brightness variations caused by the spots to those caused by a planet.

Hmm, right. So, the problem is asking, if instead of spots, there was a planet causing the same change in brightness, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star's radius.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

Dip = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So the amplitude of the dip is the square of the planet's radius divided by the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the spots are causing a similar dip effect as a planet would. So I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, they make the star appear dimmer. The overall effect would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so spot temperature is 5000 K. But how does that affect the light output?

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity per unit area (flux) is proportional to T^4. So each spot emits less flux than the surrounding photosphere.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. It's 20%, so 0.2. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, but the star's total surface area is 4πR², but each hemisphere is 2πR². So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface is 4πR². So the fraction of the total surface area that's spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) )= 0.1 or 10%. Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere (so 20% of that hemisphere's area), which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the total area with spots is
