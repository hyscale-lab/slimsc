Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I need to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both systems are binary, meaning each has two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question gives me the periods of their eclipses and the radial velocity amplitudes of each star in the system.

Let me think about what I remember about binary stars and radial velocities. Oh right, in a binary system, the stars orbit each other, and their radial velocities (the velocities along the line of sight from Earth) change periodically. The amplitudes of these velocities are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass, while the less massive star will move faster.

So, the key here is probably to use Kepler's third law for binary systems. I think Kepler's law relates the orbital period to the masses of the stars and the size of their orbit. But wait, since we're dealing with radial velocities, maybe I should think about the mass function or something related to the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, I remember that the sum of the velocities of the two stars should be equal because they're orbiting each other. Like, if one star has a velocity v, the other has V, then m1*v = m2*V, where m1 and m2 are their masses. Because the center of mass requires m1*r1 = m2*r2, but velocities are proportional to radius (since both have the same orbital period), so v1 = (2πr1)/P and v2 = (2πr2)/P. So, v1/v2 = r1/r2 = m2/m1. So, m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Wait, but in the problem, the two stars in each system have their own velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, 15 and 10 km/s. So, I think the mass ratio would be the inverse ratio of their velocities.

So, for system_1, the two masses m1 and m2. The velocities are v1 =10, v2=5. So, m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5. So, m1 is 0.5 times m2. So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. Wait, but wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, system_1's masses are m1 and m2, and their velocities are v1 and v2, so m1/m2 = v2 / v1. So, if v2 is smaller, m1 is smaller than m2, right? Because the less massive star moves faster.

So for system_1, the mass ratio is m1/m2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5. So, m1 =0.5 m2. So the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2
