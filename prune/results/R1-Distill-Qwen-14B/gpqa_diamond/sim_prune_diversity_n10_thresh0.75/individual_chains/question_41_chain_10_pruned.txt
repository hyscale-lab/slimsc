Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light beams and relative speeds. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame. They want to know the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, right, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here, so the speed in the glass would normally be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about how in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if you're on a train moving at speed v, and you see something moving at speed u inside the train, someone on the ground would see it moving at (u + v) divided by (1 + (u*v)/(c^2)), but wait, that's when you're dealing with speeds close to c. But in this case, the speed of the light in the glass is much less than c, because it's 1/n. So for n ≥ 1, that speed is ≤1, but when the glass is moving, perhaps we can use the regular velocity addition formula.

Wait, no, I think that's only when you're dealing with objects moving at speeds comparable to c. But in this problem, the glass is moving at velocity v
