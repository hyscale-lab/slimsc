Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in a system of particles. Let me make sure I understand the setup.

The problem says: There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, I think the key here is to calculate the electric potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, we have to consider all the interactions between the charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so I guess the 12 others are all at 2 meters from P. So, each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge at P. But also, those 12 are identical and presumably free to move, but constrained to stay 2m from P. So, how are they arranged? Are they all in the same point as each other? No, that can't be because then the distances between them would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy. So maybe they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, each at the same distance. But to minimize the potential energy, how would they arrange themselves?

Wait, but wait.
