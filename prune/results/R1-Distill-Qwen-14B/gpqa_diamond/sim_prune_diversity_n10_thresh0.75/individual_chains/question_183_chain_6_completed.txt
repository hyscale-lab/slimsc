Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a certain reaction. Let's see what the problem says.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus double bonds in the molecule. So I need to figure out what the product looks like after reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right, that's the reaction where HI acts as a strong acid, and red phosphorus is a catalyst maybe? Or wait, no, I think this is the hydrolysis reaction. Or wait, maybe it's a halogenation reaction. Oh wait, no, another possibility: when you have a carbonyl group and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's called the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, yes! Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So the aldehyde group (formyl) would be reduced.

Wait, the starting material has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde. So if I apply Clemmensen, the aldehyde group (RCHO) would be reduced to RCH2OH? Wait, no. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, wait, wait—maybe I'm mixing things up. Another reaction: when you have HI and red phosphorus, that's the reaction where you break alkenes. Oh wait, no, another possibility. If the molecule has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde, and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's the Wittig reaction? Or no, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and aldehydes to make ylides.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, or maybe in some elimination reactions. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's the formation of the carbonyl group from an acid chloride. No, that's with PCl5 or something.

Wait, another thought: when you have an acid like a carboxylic acid, and you treat it with excess HI, maybe it gets converted into the corresponding acid iodide. But I'm not sure how red phosphorus comes into play here. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look up what reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps it's the hydrohalogenation of a carbonyl group. For example, in the presence of a strong acid like HI, the carbonyl oxygen could get protonated, making the carbonyl into a better leaving group. But then what?

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structure of the starting molecule. 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at the 3 position (cyclohex-3-ene), so the ring itself has a double bond. So the ring is a cyclohexene.

So the molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring)
- A formyl group at position 2 (so another double bond from CHO)
- A vinyl group at position 5 (which is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so that's another double bond)
- And a carboxylic acid group at some position.

Wait, wait. The substituents are 2-formyl and 5-vinyl. The ring is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then the substituents are at C2 and C5.

So the molecule has:

1. The cyclohexene ring with a double bond (so that's one H.D.)

2. The formyl group (CHO) which has a double bond (so another H.D.)

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) which also has a double bond (another H.D.)

So before any reaction, the molecule has three double bonds (or one ring plus two double bonds?), but wait, the index is the sum of rings and double bonds. So let me count.

The cyclohexene has one double bond. The formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond). The vinyl group is another double bond. So that's three double bonds. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

Wait, but wait—the formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl, so that's one. The vinyl is CH2=CH-, so another double bond, that's two. The cyclohexene has another, making three. So the starting material has three double bonds, so the index is 3.

But wait, the starting molecule: 2-formyl is on the ring, so the ring is in the cyclohexene. So the ring has a double bond (so that's one H.D.), the formyl group is a carbonyl (another H.D.), and the vinyl group is another (third H.D.). So yes, HD index is 3.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So what happens?

As I thought earlier, perhaps this is a reaction that reduces the carbonyl group. Wait, under what conditions? The Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. The reaction conditions are acidic. But in this case, it's HI and red phosphorus. Hmm.

Wait, I think that when a carbonyl is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a different reaction. Maybe it's the hydrohalogenation of the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation. For example, the formyl group (CHO) can be converted into CH2I under certain conditions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the specific reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's with ketones and peracids.

Wait, another thought: HI in presence of red phosphorus is used in the deoxygenation of ketones and aldehydes. For example, a formyl group (RCHO) can be converted into RCH2I. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI might induce the formation of a ylide, but that's more in the Wittig reaction. Wait, the Wittig reaction typically uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide to form a ylide, which then reacts with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the carbonyl. No, that would require acid and water. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's the acid-catalyzed addition of HI to the carbonyl. So the formyl group (CHO) would react with HI. Let me think: when a carbonyl reacts with HI, it can form a diiodide. For example, RCOCH3 + HI -> RCH2I + other products. Or perhaps it's the formation of an iodide from a ketone.

Wait, but in general, strong nucleophiles like HI might add to the carbonyl. So the formyl group (CHO) would react with HI. Let me think about the mechanism.

The aldehyde would be protonated by HI's H+ (since HI is a strong acid), making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the I- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a geminal diiodide. So RCHO + 2 HI → RCH(I)2 + H2O.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry here. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of an imidazole intermediate, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is removing the formyl group. Let's think, after the reaction, what happens to the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Let me think: if the formyl group is reduced, it would become a methylene group (CH2). So the formyl CHO becomes CH2OH? Or CH2I? Or perhaps it's completely reduced to a CH2 group. Wait, but reduction of aldehydes usually gives primary alcohols. But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall product after reaction. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

After reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, let's see.

Assuming that the formyl group is converted. Let's say the formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH? Or maybe it's removed entirely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is removing the formyl group and adding I somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions often lead to the cleavage of the formyl group. For example, in the presence of HI and heat, the formyl group might undergo elimination. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is transformed into a methyl group. Like, CHO becomes CH2I? Or perhaps the reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the reaction isn't affecting the formyl group but another part of the molecule.

Wait, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond. HI is a strong acid and can protonate the double bond, leading to addition. But with excess HI, perhaps it's causing ring-opening or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is reacting. The vinyl group is a substituent on the cyclohexene. So, in the presence of HI, maybe the double bond in the vinyl group is undergoing some addition.

Wait, but if that were the case, the product would have single bonds where there were double bonds. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a methyl iodide. Let me think: if the aldehyde (CHO) is converted to CH2I2, but that's a geminal diiodide. Then, perhaps the molecule would lose some iodide and form a new structure.

Wait, but then what about the rest of the molecule? The cyclohexene ring is still present, the vinyl group is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. But without any existing halogens, I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride. But the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so in presence of SOCl2 or similar, but the reagent here is HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm, maybe I should look up what reaction HI and red phosphorus have with aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, another thought: I remember that when an aldehyde or ketone is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it leads to the formation of a diiodo compound. For example, RCHO + 2 HI → RCH(I)2 + H2O.

But if that's the case, then the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH(I)2. So that's two iodines added there.

But then, what about the other parts of the molecule? The cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group.

Wait, but the vinyl group has a double bond (CH2=CH-). In the presence of HI, maybe that's undergoing addition as well. For example, adding HI across the double bond. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2CH2I? Wait, no, that's not correct. When HX adds to a double bond, it adds across the double bond, so CH2=CH- would become CH2-CH2-I after adding HI? No, wait. The addition would be H on one carbon and I on the other, leading to CH2-I-CH2-? Or more accurately, the double bond would become a single bond with I and H added to each adjacent carbon.

Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So if the double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is opened with HI, it would become CH2-I-CH2- attached to the ring.

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is only affecting the formyl group, and the rest of the molecule remains unchanged.

Wait, but the reaction is with excess HI. So perhaps multiple sites are reacting. Let's try to outline all possible changes:

1. The cyclohexene ring's double bond: would it react with HI? Under acidic conditions, maybe it could undergo addition. So the ring's double bond (C3-C4) would add HI across it, becoming a single bond with I on one carbon and H on the other. But if that's the case, the ring would lose a double bond, reducing the HD index.

2. The formyl group (CHO) would react with HI. Possibly, it would be converted into CH(I)2, as I thought earlier. So the aldehyde group's double bond (C=O) would be replaced by two iodines, so that would eliminate that HD.

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would also react with HI. Adding HI across the double bond, so that would become CH2-CH2I, but that would eliminate the double bond, thus reducing HD.

So all three double bonds (the ring, formyl, and vinyl) would be converted into single bonds with iodine atoms, and possibly some hydrogen.

But wait, let me think about that. The initial HD index was 3 (from three double bonds). If each of these double bonds is converted into single bonds, then each would decrease the HD index by one. So 3 - 3 = 0. But wait, HD index is the sum of rings and double bonds. So if the ring's double bond is converted into a single bond, that would decrease HD by 1. The formyl's double bond is replaced, HD down by 1. The vinyl's double bond is replaced, HD down by 1. So total HD would be 3 - 3 = 0. So the product would have an HD index of 0.

But wait, that's only if all three double bonds are saturated. Let me confirm each part.

First, the cyclohexene ring. If HI is present in excess and in acidic conditions, the ring's double bond would undergo electrophilic addition. So the ring would become cyclohexane with an added HI across the double bond. So the ring would have a single bond, so HD decreases by 1. So HD becomes 2.

Then, the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I2. So the carbonyl becomes CH(I)2, which is a single bond now. HD goes down by 1. HD is now 1.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) reacts with HI, adding across the double bond. So the CH2=CH- becomes CH2-CH2I, which is a single bond. HD decreases by 1. So HD is now 0.

But wait, that would make the HD index 0. So the product would be a fully saturated molecule, with no double bonds or rings.

But wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid (COOH group). Would that react with HI and red phosphorus?

In the presence of HI, carboxylic acids can react to form acid iodides. The reaction is:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O

So the carboxylic acid group would be converted into an acyl iodide (RCOI). But I'm not sure if this reaction is happening under the given conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that the formyl group is being converted, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the main question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So regardless of other reactions, if all three double bonds are gone, the HD index would be zero.

But wait, the cyclohexene ring's double bond is one HD. The formyl group's double bond is another. The vinyl group's is the third. So all three are being eliminated, leading to HD index zero.

So the product would have an HD index of 0.

Looking at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other double bonds or rings?

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 HD), a formyl group (1 HD), and a vinyl group (1 HD). So three HDs. If all are converted to single bonds, HD becomes 0.

What about the carboxylic acid group? If it's converted to an acid iodide, does that affect the HD index? The COOH group is RCOOH, which is a carbonyl (so another HD). Wait, wait, did I miss that?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene-Carboxylic acid.

So the structure is:

A cyclohexene ring (double bond) → 1 HD.

A formyl group (CHO) → another HD.

A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → another HD.

And the carboxylic acid group (COOH) → another HD because the carbonyl is a double bond.

Wait, so that's four HDs. I think I missed that earlier. Oh no! So the initial HD index is four, not three.

Wait, but wait. The carboxylic acid group is COOH. The structure is O=C-OH. The carbonyl is a double bond, so that's an HD. So yes, the starting material has four HDs: ring (1), formyl (2), vinyl (3), and COOH (4).

So if that's the case, and all are affected by the reaction with HI and red phosphorus.

So let's reevaluate.

The cyclohexene ring's double bond (1) may be saturated by HI addition. So HD index down by 1 → HD=3.

The formyl group's double bond (2) is converted, HD=2.

The vinyl group's double bond (3) is converted, HD=1.

The carboxylic acid group's double bond (4) is converted. How? Well, the COOH group could be converted into an acid iodide (RCOI), which still has a carbonyl (so HD remains). Or perhaps it's reduced.

Wait, if the COOH group is converted into RCOI, then the carbonyl is still present. So HD remains at 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is reduced. For example, using HI and red phosphorus, maybe the COOH is reduced to CH2OH. But would that happen?

Wait, another scenario: In the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is deprotonated and then reacts. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction is red phosphorus and excess HI. So perhaps all carbonyl groups are being attacked. So the COOH group, being a carbonyl, would react.

So the COOH (RCOOH) would convert into an acid iodide (RCOI). So the carbonyl (O=C-O-) would become O=C-I. So the carbonyl is still present, so HD remains.

Wait, but if the COOH group is converted into COI, that's a substituent with a carbonyl, so the HD count still includes that.

Hmm. So let me recount HDs after the reaction.

Assuming:

- Cyclohexene ring → becomes cyclohexane (no double bond) → HD from ring is gone (so HD reduces by 1).

- Formyl group → CH(I)2 (double bond gone) → HD reduces by 1.

- Vinyl group → CH2-CH2I (double bond gone) → HD reduces by 1.

- COOH → RCOI (still has a carbonyl) → HD remains the same (still 1 for COI group).

So initial HD was 4. After reaction, HD would be 4 - 3 = 1.

Wait, but that's if the COOH group's HD remains. So HD after reaction is 1. So the answer would be option A (1).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me think again.

So the starting molecule has four HDs:

1. Cyclohexene ring (1)
2. Formyl group (2)
3. Vinyl group (3)
4. COOH group (4)

Wait no, the COOH group's carbonyl is part of the same carbon as the cyclohexene ring. So perhaps I'm overcounting.

Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 2 (formyl) and position 5 (vinyl), and another substituent is the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 5, and perhaps another position for the COOH group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or is it a substituent on the ring?

Wait, the "cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid" suggests that the carboxylic acid is attached to the ring at position 3. So the ring has three substituents: formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and COOH at 3? Or maybe the numbering is different.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at position 3) has a formyl group at position 2, a vinyl group at position 5, and a carboxylic acid group at position 3 (since it's cyclohexene-carboxylic acid). Or perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. So positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are adjacent.

But regardless, the substituents are formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and carboxylic acid at position 3. So the ring has a double bond (cyclohexene), the formyl group has a carbonyl, the vinyl group has a double bond, and the COOH group has a carbonyl.

So that's four double bonds or rings contributing to HD.

So HD index is 4.

So after reaction, the product's HD index depends on how many of these are converted into single bonds.

Assuming:

1. Cyclohexene ring's double bond is saturated (HI addition) → HD index down by 1 → 3 left.

2. Formyl group's double bond is converted → HD down by 1 → 2 left.

3. Vinyl group's double bond is converted → HD down by 1 → 1 left.

4. COOH group's double bond: if it's converted into COI, the carbonyl is still present → HD remains 1.

Alternatively, if the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH, the carbonyl is gone. Let's think about that.

If the COOH group is reduced. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is reduced to a CH2OH group. So the COOH (which is RCOOH) becomes RCH2OH. So the carbonyl is gone (so HD index decreases by 1).

In that case, HD would be 4 - 4 = 0.

But wait, would the reaction reduce the COOH group?

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an acid chloride, but with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: when HI is present in excess, perhaps the COOH group is not only converted but also the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction reduces all carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is more likely to convert carbonyls into their corresponding iodides.

Wait, but if the COOH group is converted into an acid iodide (RCOI), then the carbonyl is still present, so HD remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that all carbonyl groups are reduced. So:

- The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH.

- The vinyl group's double bond is saturated (HI addition) → becomes CH2-CH2I.

- The ring's double bond is saturated → becomes cyclohexane.

- The COOH group is reduced to CH2OH.

So in this case, all the double bonds are gone, so HD index would be 0.

But I'm not certain about whether the COOH group is reduced under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group, so its HD remains. So HD index would be 1.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think about what the product would look like.

Assuming all the carbonyl groups are converted into single bonds.

So:

- The formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I2? Or perhaps CH2- group.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2I.

- The ring's double bond becomes single with I addition.

- The COOH group becomes COI.

But if the COOH becomes COI, then its HD is still present.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is not affected by the reaction conditions. For example, maybe it's a stronger acid and not reacting under these conditions.

Wait, but HI is a very strong acid. Perhaps it would deprotonate the COOH group, turning it into a COO- group. Then, maybe it would react with HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an acid iodide, which would still have a carbonyl group, so HD remains.

So, in the product:

- The cyclohexene ring is now a cyclohexane with substituents.

- The formyl group is now CH2I2.

- The vinyl group is now CH2-CH2I.

- The COOH group is now COI.

So HD index:

- Cyclohexane: no ring (since it was a ring but the double bond is gone) → HD index for ring is gone.

Wait, no. The ring was originally a cyclohexene with one HD (the ring's double bond). If the ring's double bond is saturated, then HD from the ring is gone.

So in the product, the HD index comes from:

1. The formyl group: if it's CH2I2, then the double bond is gone → no HD.

2. The vinyl group: if it's CH2-CH2I, then the double bond is gone → no HD.

3. The COOH group: if it's COI, then the carbonyl is present → HD index 1.

So HD index is 1.

So the product's HD index is 1.

But wait, the reaction might not affect the COOH group, or perhaps it's unaffected.

Wait, another angle. The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is often used in the dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of the iodide from the aldehyde group. So the formyl group becomes CH2I2. The vinyl group's double bond becomes CH2-CH2I. The ring's double bond becomes CH2-CH2I as well. But the COOH group remains as COOH, so the carbonyl is still present.

So HD index after reaction: the ring's double bond is gone (HD=0), formyl's gone (HD=0), vinyl's gone (HD=0), COOH's HD=1. So total HD=1.

Thus, the index is 1, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely certain about whether the COOH group is affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is converted into an acid iodide, which still has the carbonyl, so HD=1.

Alternatively, if the COOH group is reduced, the HD would drop.

But without more information, I think the likely scenario is that the product has an HD index of 1.

Wait, but wait—what if the COOH group is reduced? Let's think about that possibility.

Red phosphorus and HI: if the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH, then the carbonyl is gone, so HD index would decrease.

So:

- Starting HD: 4.

After reaction:

- ring: no HD.

- formyl: no HD.

- vinyl: no HD.

- COOH: becomes CH2OH, so no HD.

Thus, HD=0.

But I'm not sure if the COOH group is reduced under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group remains unaffected, so HD is 1.

In that case, the answer would be A) 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the dehydrohalogenation reaction, perhaps. Or maybe in the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction. Wait, but the Wittig requires a base, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the formyl group. For example, the formyl group (CHO) could undergo cleavage to form a CH2 group, releasing CO2 or something.

Wait, another possibility: the formyl group could be converted into a methyl group. So CHO → CH3. If that's the case, then the HD index from the formyl group is lost.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is reduced. Clemmensen reduction converts aldehydes to alkanes. So RCHO → RCH2OH. But under different conditions, maybe it's RCHO → RCH3.

Wait, but Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. In this case, the reagent is red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps the formyl group is being reduced to a methyl group.

If that's the case, the formyl group's HD is lost.

So, HD index:

- ring: 1.

- formyl: 0.

- vinyl: 1.

- COOH: 1.

Total HD: 3.

Wait, but that's more HDs than before. No, that can't be.

Wait, no, the ring's double bond is a HD. If the formyl group is reduced (so HD from that is gone), the vinyl group's HD is still present, and COOH's HD is present.

So HD would be 3 → 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) = 3.

Wait, that can't be right because the initial HD was 4.

No, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is saturated. So HD index after reaction is:

ring: 0.

formyl: 0 (reduced to CH3).

vinyl: 0 (saturated).

COOH: 1.

So HD index is 1.

But this is getting too speculative.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group. So HD from COOH remains.

So the product would have:

- Ring: HD=0 (if the double bond is saturated).

- Formyl: HD=0 (if CHO is converted to CH2I2 or CH3).

- Vinyl: HD=0 (if saturated).

- COOH: HD=1.

Thus, HD index is 1.

So the answer would be option A) 1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the COOH group is converted into something that still has a carbonyl, so HD remains. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is unaffected, so HD remains.

But given the time I've spent, I think the answer is likely option A) 1.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (HD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The HD index is calculated as the sum of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: Contains a double bond (1 HD).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: Contains a carbonyl double bond (1 HD).
3. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)**: Contains a double bond (1 HD).
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: Contains a carbonyl double bond (1 HD).

Thus, the starting material has an HD index of **4**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and excess HI) suggest the following transformations:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: The double bond in the ring undergoes addition of HI, converting it into a single bond. This eliminates 1 HD.
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: The carbonyl double bond is converted into a single bond, likely forming CH(I)₂ or CH₂I. This eliminates 1 HD.
3. **Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)**: The double bond undergoes addition of HI, converting it into a single bond (CH₂-CH₂I). This eliminates 1 HD.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (COOH)**: The carbonyl double bond may remain intact, depending on the reaction conditions. If the COOH group is converted into an acid iodide (RCOI), the carbonyl double bond persists, contributing 1 HD.

### Step 3: Calculate the HD index of the product
After the reaction:
- The cyclohexene ring contributes **0 HD** (double bond saturated).
- The formyl group contributes **0 HD** (double bond saturated).
- The vinyl group contributes **0 HD** (double bond saturated).
- The carboxylic acid group contributes **1 HD** (if the carbonyl double bond remains).

Thus, the HD index of the product is **1**.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **A) 1**: Matches the calculated HD index of the product.
- **B) 3**: Incorrect, as three HDs are eliminated during the reaction.
- **C) 5**: Incorrect, as the starting material only has 4 HDs.
- **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the carboxylic acid group contributes 1 HD in the product.

### Final Answer:
The HD index of the product is **1**.
