Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential in two dimensions.

The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, okay, I remember that in two-dimensional problems, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, it's helpful to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. So let me try to do that.

Wait, the potential has two terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential because the standard harmonic oscillator in radial coordinates is (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's written in terms of k and r². The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. That seems to depend on the angle θ, so it's an angular part.

I think I should write the potential as a sum of a radial part and an angular part. Let me see: V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), where V_r(r) = (1/2)kr² and V_θ(θ) = (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, but actually, wait a second. Wait, no, because the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ, which can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ) or something else, but perhaps it's better to see if the potential is separable.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). Oh, but maybe I can separate variables here because the potential has a radial part and an angular part. So perhaps the solution can be written as a product of radial and angular parts.

But wait, the potential here depends on r² multiplied by cos²θ. So that might complicate things because usually, for separable potentials, the angular part would be a function of θ alone, without any r dependence. Wait, but in this case, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²
