Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. The question is asking for the exo product, and there are four options provided.

Hmm, first I need to recall what a [4+2] cycloaddition is. Oh right, that's a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder reaction is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring, typically bicyclic or with substituents.

Wait, so in this case, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is probably the diene or the dienophile. Let me think. Thiophene is an aromatic five-membered ring with one sulfur atom. 2,5-dimethyl means there are methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another compound. Furan is a five-membered ring with oxygen, and the 2,5-dione means there are ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So, the structure is like a furan with two ketones on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait. For a Diels-Alder reaction, I need a conjugated diene and a dienophile. The dienophile is typically something electron-deficient, like a ketone or an alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl. So furan-2,5-dione has two ketones; maybe that makes it a good dienophile?

Alternatively, 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a diene. Thiophene is aromatic, but when it's part of a Diels-Alder reaction, it would act as a diene? Wait, but thiophene is a five-membered ring. Wait, the Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene, which is four conjugated double bonds, like 1,3-butadiene. But thiophene has a five-membered ring with one double bond. Wait, no, the structure of thiophene is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds, right? So, it has two double bonds, but in a ring.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the structures again. 2,
