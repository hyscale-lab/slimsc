Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is 8e-16 seconds. They want the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think it has to do with particle decay lengths and relativistic effects. So, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation.

Right, the lifetime observed in the lab frame (tau) is gamma times tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/mc², but wait, since E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, I can calculate gamma as E/(m c²). Wait, but c is a big number, but since the units are in GeV, maybe it's just E/(m), because E = gamma m c², and when we take gamma, it's E/(m c²), but I think here, since E is given in GeV and mass is in GeV/c² (I think), but maybe the c² cancels out. Let me think: In particle physics, energies and masses are often given in units where c is set to 1. So E (GeV) = gamma m (GeV/c²) * c², so yes, E = gamma m. So gamma would be E/m. So gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approx 7.917. Let me compute that exactly: 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 *7.9 is about 27. So 27 ÷ 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

So gamma is approximately 7.918. Then the lifetime tau is gamma * tau_0, which is 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8 *7.918 is about 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s is the tau.

Wait, no: 7.918 * 8 is 63.344, so tau is 6.3344e-15 seconds. Wait, wait, 8e-16 * 7.918 is 6.3344e-15 seconds. Right.

Now, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * tau. But wait, to find the velocity, v, I think we can use beta gamma c, since p = gamma m v, and beta is v/c. Alternatively, since gamma is known, beta can be found from gamma = 1/ sqrt(1 - beta²). Hmm, maybe a better approach is to find beta from the energy.

Wait, another approach: The particle's energy is 27 GeV. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). But since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps we can work in natural units where c=1, so E² = p² + m². Then p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(27^2 - (3.41)^2) GeV.

Let me compute that. 27 squared is 729, and 3.41 squared is around 11.6281. So 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719. The square root of that is sqrt(717.37) ≈ 26.78 GeV/c. So p ≈ 26.78 GeV/c.

Then, the momentum p is gamma m v, so p = gamma m v. Since v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c. But in natural units, c=1, so p = gamma m beta. Hmm, but maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, since we have gamma, maybe we can find beta.

Wait, another way: beta is (pc)/E. Since p is 26.78 GeV/c and E is 27 GeV, beta = (26.78 GeV/c * c ) / 27 GeV = 26.78 /27 ≈ 0.9919. So beta is approximately 0.9919. So v ≈ 0.9919 c.

So, the velocity v is approximately 0.9919 times the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second.

So, decay length L = v * tau = 0.9919 * c * tau.

Tau is 6.3344e-15 seconds, so let's compute that.

v = 0.9919 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9757e8 m/s.

Then, L = 2.9757e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s. Let's compute
