Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture. In the far field region, it creates intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so the tan(theta) approximation (tan(theta) ≈ theta) can be used.

Hmm. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and this diffraction pattern can be observed in the far field. The pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at a specific angle, but this is a polygon, and when N is large, the polygon approaches a circle. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, so maybe it's similar to the Bessel function zeros for a circular aperture.

Wait, no. Wait, because the polygon is a different shape. But when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle. So, maybe the result is similar to the circular case, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

In the case of a single slit, which is a different scenario, the diffraction minima occur at certain angles. But this isn't a single slit; it's an aperture with a particular shape. Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a multi-slit system, but that might not directly apply here.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a regular polygon, how does the diffraction pattern look? Alternatively, when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle, so perhaps the first minima would be similar to the first minima of a circular aperture.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where the Bessel function J1 has its first zero. The condition is sin(π a sinθ / λ) = 0, but wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, let me think again: the condition for minima
