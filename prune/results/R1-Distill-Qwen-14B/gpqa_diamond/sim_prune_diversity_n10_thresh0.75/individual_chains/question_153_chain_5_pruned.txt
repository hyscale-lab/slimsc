Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate intermediate.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and reagents. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's tackle each one individually.

Starting with part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base, which would deprotonate the alpha position of the carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a di-ester, so the malonate ion is a strong nucleophile. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, specifically methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. E-configuration means the substituents are on opposite sides.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (malonate) would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the malonate's enolate would attack the beta position, leading to a conjugate addition. Let me draw this out mentally. The acrylate has a double bond between C2 and C3. The p-tolyl group is on C3. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. No, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, if it's 3-substituted, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO– something. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OEt. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the acrylate. So when the malonate attacks, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is the conjugate base) will attack the beta carbon, which is the C2 of the acrylate. So the nucleophilic attack will occur at C2 of the acrylate, which is the less substituted position but conjugated.

After the attack, the two molecules combine. The malonate brings two ester groups (since it's dim
