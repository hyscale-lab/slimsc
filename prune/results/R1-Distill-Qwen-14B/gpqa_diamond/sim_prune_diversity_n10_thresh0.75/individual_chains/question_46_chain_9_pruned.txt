Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and finding out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. But wait, the starting material here is an alkene, so it's probably a ring-closing or some kind of internal metathesis.

The compound given is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, the substituents—3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count the carbons.

Pent is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, because pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So that's CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's better to write it as CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, wait, pent-1-ene: positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Double bond between 1 and 2. Then, the substituent is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Yes, that seems right. So the molecule is CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CH₃.

But wait, the question says it's racemic. So that means there's a stereocenter, and it's a
