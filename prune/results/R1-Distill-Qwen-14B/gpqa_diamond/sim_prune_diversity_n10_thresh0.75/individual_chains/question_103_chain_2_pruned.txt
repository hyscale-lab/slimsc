Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I have to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let's see what the target molecule is.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure would be (phenyl group)C(O)CH3. But the phenyl group has substituents: there's a bromine and a nitro group attached. The positions are 3 and 5. So if I imagine the benzene ring, numbering starts such that the ketone is on position 1. Then, position 3 would be meta to that, and position 5 would be para to position 3? Wait, maybe I should think of the substituents in a way that gives the correct numbering.

Actually, wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So the phenyl group is connected to the ketone at position 1. Then, the other substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that point. So, let's imagine the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 (which is meta to the ketone), and the nitro group is at position 5 (which is para to the ketone? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, no, position 5 would be another meta position? Wait, maybe it's better to draw a benzene ring with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the benzene ring as follows: the ketone group is attached at position 1, the bromine at position 3, and the nitro group at position 5. So, in a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. Wait, no, that's not possible. Because each position is separated by two carbons. So, if position 1 is where the ketone is attached, then position 3 is two carbons away, and position 5 is another two. Wait, that would mean positions 1,3,5 are all equally spaced, forming a sort of trigonal arrangement. So the nitro and bromine are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So the benzene ring has ketone at 1, nitro at 5, and bromine at 3. Alternatively, it could be nitro at 3 and bromine at 5. Hmm, but the formula is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the substituents are on the benzene ring at positions 3 and 5. So, the benzene ring attached to the ketone has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

So, the plan is to synthesize this compound starting from benzene. I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that will add these substituents correctly.

Let me think about the steps involved. The final product has a ketone group (acetone), a bromine, and a nitro group. Benz
