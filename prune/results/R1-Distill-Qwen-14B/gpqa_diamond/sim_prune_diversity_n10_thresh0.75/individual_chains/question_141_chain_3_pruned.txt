Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed. The options are from A to D.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a bit confusing. Oh, wait! Benzene has six carbons, numbered 1 through 6. So 1-bromo-2-d would be a substituent on the benzene ring. Wait, the "d" probably stands for deuterium. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d means that at position 2, there's a deuterium atom. Wait, does that mean that position 2 has a hydrogen replaced by deuterium, or is there another substituent? Or perhaps it's 2-deutero-1-bromobenzene.

Wait, maybe the structure is bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 of benzene. So the benzene ring has Br on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so depending on the substitution pattern, the deuterium might be in a specific position. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, meaning that carbon 1 has Br, and carbon 2 has D in place of H. But then, how does that affect the reaction?

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for dehydro
