Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

But wait, the state is in the eigenbasis of P_x, right? So maybe I should first express this state in terms of the P_z basis? Or perhaps since the basis is already the eigenvectors of P_z, maybe I can work directly with the given vector?

Wait, no. The state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. Because the problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. That's good because it simplifies things.

So the state |ψ> is represented as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Each component here is the amplitude of the corresponding P_z eigenstate.

First, I should check if the state is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1.

Calculating that: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2.

That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ΔP_z, I'll compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal. Looking back at the problem statement, P_z's matrix is given as:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

Wait, wait. Let me write that out. The matrix for P_z is diagonal. The first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ.

Wait, no. The matrix given for P_z is:

Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

Wait, no, the problem says P_z's matrix has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). Wait, that's a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ. That seems a bit odd because if it's diagonal, then each basis vector is an eigenstate. But the second component is zero. Hmm, okay.

So each basis vector |1>, |2>, |3> corresponds to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, since the basis is the eigenbasis, each component is multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ( -1/2 )^2 * ħ + (1/√2 )^2 * 0 + ( -1/2 )^2 * (-ħ )

Wait, wait, no. Because the components are the amplitudes. So the expectation value is the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue for each component.

So for each component i of the state, the contribution is |ψ_i|^2 * eigenvalue_i.

So let's compute each term:

First term (i=1): | -1/2 |^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ.

Second term (i=2): |1/√2 |^2 * 0 = (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term (i=3): | -1/2 |^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4) * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

Since each eigenvalue is squared (because P_z² has eigenvalues (eigenvalue)^2).

So for each component:

First term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

Second term: (1/2) * (0)^2 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * (-ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ħ².

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. But when we take P_z squared, the eigenvalues become (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2, which is ħ², 0, ħ².

So when we computed ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is |ψ_i|^2 times (eigenvalue)^2. Which is the same as |ψ_i|^2 * (ħ)^2 for i=1 and i=3, and 0 for i=2.

So the calculation for ⟨P_z²⟩ gives (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, but wait again, in the state vector, the components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the |amplitudes|^2 are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4).

So ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)*ħ + 0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) → (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)(ħ²) + 0 + (1/4)(ħ²) → (1/2) ħ².

So variance is 1/2 ħ², so uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). That's option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2), which matches. So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $|\psi\rangle$), and $\lambda_i$ are the corresponding eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:

- $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_1 = \hbar$.
- $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, so $|c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $\lambda_2 = 0$.
- $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $|c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^3 |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Using the same probabilities $|c_i|^2$ and eigenvalues $\lambda_i^2$:

- For $i=1$: $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$, so the contribution is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- For $i=2$: $\lambda_2^2 = 0$, so the contribution is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$.
- For $i=3$: $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$, so the contribution is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
