Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

Wait, the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh, right, because EDTA's ability to form complexes with metals depends on the pH. At a certain pH, the EDTA is in the form that can bind the metal effectively. So I don't have to worry about pH affecting the complex formation here; it's already optimal.

So the complex is Ca-EDTA. Let's think about the dissociation of this complex. The reaction would be something like Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The formation constant Kf is given, which is 5e10. Wait, formation constant is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA]. So, since Kf is large, the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. But I'm supposed to find the concentration of Ca²+.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the complex as C. So, initially, [C] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are zero. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So, at equilibrium, [C] would be 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), x should be very small compared to 0.02. So I can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That would make the math easier.

So plugging into the Kf expression: Kf = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02. Because EDTA^4- and Ca²+ are both from the dissociation, their concentrations are both x.

So Kf = x² / 0.02 =5e10. Let me solve for x.

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9. So x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, wait, that can't be right. 3e4 is 30,000 M, which is way higher than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense. So my assumption that x is small must be wrong. Oh no, that's a problem.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the Kf equation. Wait, the formation constant is Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaEDTA]. So if x is the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA, then [CaEDTA] is 0.02 - x. So Kf should be (x)(x)/(0.02
