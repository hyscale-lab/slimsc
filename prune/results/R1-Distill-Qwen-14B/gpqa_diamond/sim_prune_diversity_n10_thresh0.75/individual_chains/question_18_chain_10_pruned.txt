Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that Star_1 has a mass of 1.5 times the Sun, and Star_2 is 1.2 times. But wait, do the masses matter here? The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass affects something else, but I'm not sure yet. I'll keep that in mind, maybe it's a red herring.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Then there's [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, these are logarithmic abundance ratios. So the brackets mean log base 10 of the ratio of the element to hydrogen, I think. Wait, noâ€”the notation [X/Y] is usually log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. Or is it the logarithm of the ratio of the element to another element, relative to the Sun? Wait, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, the standard notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun's ratio. So for [Fe/H], it's log10(Fe/H star) - log10(Fe/H sun). And if [Fe/H] is 0, that means Fe/H is the same as in the Sun.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, wait. Let me think. The notation can be a bit tricky. The problem says that for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that would mean log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH =10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10
