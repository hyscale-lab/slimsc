Okay, so I've got this question about an aromatic compound, and I need to figure out the correct H NMR data based on the given information. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so if it's di-substituted, there are two substituents. But the total is 8 carbons. Hmm. So the substituents must add two more carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. But wait, wait, substituents can be more than one carbon each. Let me think. If it's di-substituted, each substituent can be a group that's more than one carbon. Like, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is O=C-, but that's only one carbon. Or maybe a substituent is a methyl group, another substituent is a carbonyl, but that would still only add two carbons. Wait, but the total is 8 carbons for the entire molecule. So the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus substituents equals 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So perhaps each substituent is a methyl group? No, that would be 6 + 2*(1) =8? No, wait, no: each substituent is probably a group with more carbons. Oh wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl
