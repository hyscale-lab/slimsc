Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |up> and |down>.

But wait, the question says it's proportional, so I guess the actual state will have a normalization factor. I'll need to calculate that. The coefficients given are (1+i) for |up> and (2 - i) for |down>.

So first, let's represent |alpha> as a vector. Let me write:

|alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down>

But to find probabilities, I need to normalize this state. That means I have to compute the norm (the squared magnitude) of the state.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly.

The normalization factor is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2. Similarly, the magnitude of (2 - i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5), so squared is 5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 - i)/sqrt(7}.

Now, the next part: the operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-½ particles. So for a 2
