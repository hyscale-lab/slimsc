Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are the possible kinetic energies for the products, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, since the pion is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means the muon and the neutrino will move in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum.

I think I should use conservation of energy here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's stationary. So energy conservation equation would be: 

m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu

But each of these energies includes their rest mass plus kinetic energy. So E_mu is (m_mu * c^2) + K_mu, and E_nu is just K_nu because neutrinos are massless (or have negligible mass, but I think in this problem, we can assume the neutrino's mass is zero).

So substituting, we get:

m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu

Which simplifies to:

K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2

Wait, so the total kinetic energy of the products is m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - m_nu c^2, but since the neutrino's mass is negligible, it's approximately m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2. So let me compute that.

m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. So 139.6 - 105.7 is 33.9 MeV. So the total kinetic energy is 33.9 MeV. But this is the sum of K_mu and K_nu.

But how do I find each individually? Oh, right, because the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must share this energy, but also their momenta must be equal and opposite.

I think I can use the relation between energy and momentum. For the muon, E_mu^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. And for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p c.

Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. So let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, which equals the neutrino's momentum.

So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )
E_nu = p c

And from conservation of energy, E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2 - m_mu c^2 - m_nu c^2, but wait, no, earlier I think I had E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2 because initially, the pion's energy is its rest mass energy (since it's stationary). Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, the initial energy is the rest mass of the pion, E_initial = m_pi c^2.

After decay, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) and the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c. So, E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2.

So
