Okay, let's see. I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh right, so it's a function in polar coordinates. I remember that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates can be tricky, but maybe I can break the potential into parts and see if it's separable or something like that.

Wait, the potential seems to have two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential because the standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V = (1/2)mω² r², but wait no, wait. Oh wait, in this case, it's written in terms of k and mass m. So maybe it's a harmonic oscillator part. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that's a bit more complicated.

I think I should try to express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates to see if it's separable or can be broken down. Because in Cartesian, r² is x² + y², and cos²θ would be (x/r)^2, right? So cosθ is x/r, so cos²θ is x²/r². So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) )= (3/2)k x². So the total potential V becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, but r² is x² + y², so substituting that in, V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me compute that:

V = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²)
= (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y²
= 2 k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh, wait, so the potential separates into x and y parts. So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2) k
