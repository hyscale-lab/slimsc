Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star physics, but let me try to think this through. Alright, the question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system_1's period is longer than system_2's.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, I need to find mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's more massive. Like, in the center of mass, the lighter star moves more. So if star A is more massive, its velocity will be smaller compared to star B.

I think the formula involves the mass ratio. Let's see. Oh right, the mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary over the primary. But wait, in radial velocities, the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude.

So for each system, the two stars' velocities (v1 and v2) are such that v1 * m1 = v2 * m2, where m is mass. Since m1 + m2 is the total mass, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, maybe I should think about the mass function because we're dealing with radial velocities.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P (1-e²))^(1/3) * ( (1 + M2/M1)^(2/3) ) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if I get that right. Alternatively, I remember that when you have two stars in a binary system, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if m1 is the mass of star 1 and m2 the mass of star 2, then m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Wait, that makes sense because if m1 is bigger, it has a smaller velocity. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. Let's call them K1a and K1b. So K1a = 10, K1b=5. Then m1a/m1b = K1b/K1a. So m1a/m1b =5/10 = 0.5. So m1a =0.5 * m1b. So the total mass of system_1 is m1a + m1b = 0.5 m1b + m1b = 1.5 m1b.

Similarly, for system_2, K2a=15, K2b=10. So m2a/m2b=10/15=2/3. So m2a= (2/3) m2b. Total mass is m2a + m2b = (2/3 m2b) + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

But wait, how do I relate the periods and masses? Oh right, the period is the same for both stars in a system because they orbit each other. So the period is the same for both. So for each system, their periods are 2 years and 1 year.

The formula that comes into play here is Kepler's third law. For a binary system, the sum of the masses is related to the period and the semi-major axis. The formula is (m1 + m2) * P^2 = (4π
