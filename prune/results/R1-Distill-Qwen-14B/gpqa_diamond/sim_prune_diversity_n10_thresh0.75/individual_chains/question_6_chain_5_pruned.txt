Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let's read the problem again.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a function of r and θ. I remember that when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to see if the potential can be separated into radial and angular parts. Because if it can, then maybe the problem becomes easier, like solving the radial part and the angular part separately.

So the potential has two terms: one that's purely radial, (1/2)kr², and another that depends on both r and θ. Let me think: the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Oh right! Cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ].

Let me compute that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4. So the second term becomes (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So putting it all together, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, the first term is (1/2)kr², and the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So when I expand cos²θ, it's (1 + cos2θ)/2, so the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). Therefore, the overall potential is (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, that's 1/2 kr² plus 3/4 kr
