Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls. Hmm, let's break it down.

Wait, the problem says that when particles are collided in a spherical detector, new particles are produced. These particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these reach the inner walls. Now, they want to find the Lorentz factor needed so that two-thirds reach the walls.

Hmm, so I think the key here is the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector's walls. Because if the particles move faster, they take less time to reach the detector, which might affect whether they decay before getting there or not. Oh right, because particles that decay before reaching the inner walls wouldn't contribute to the detection. 

Wait, so particles decay after some time. If their lifetime is longer (due to time dilation), they have a higher chance to reach the detector. The problem mentions that at a Lorentz factor of 20, one third reach the walls. We need to find the factor where two-thirds reach.

So let's think about the relation between the Lorentz factor, gamma, and the particles' lifetime. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So T = gamma * tau.

The distance the particle needs to travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. But at ultra-relativistic speeds, the velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So t â‰ˆ R / c. R is 30 meters, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Wait, but the actual time they take is t = R/(beta c). Because beta is v/c. So if beta is 1 (speed of light), t is R/c. But for lower beta, t increases.

But since the particles are produced at the center, they need to reach the wall. So the time available for them to reach the wall is t_available = R/(beta c) = (30 m) / (beta * 3e8 m/s) = 30/(beta *3e8) seconds.

Wait, but the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma
