Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state... I think that refers to the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in its ground state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state, which I guess is the first excited state.

The molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the molecule can either change vibrational or rotational state. Since the question is about the lowest possible energy increase, I think it's about the vibrational transition, because rotation might require a smaller energy jump? Or wait, no, maybe the vibrational transition requires a higher energy because the photon has to provide the energy difference for the vibration. Because in the ground state, the vibrational state is v=0, and the next would be v=1. Alternatively, rotational changes are
