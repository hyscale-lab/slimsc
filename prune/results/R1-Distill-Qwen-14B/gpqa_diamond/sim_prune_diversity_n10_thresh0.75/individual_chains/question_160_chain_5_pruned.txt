Okay, I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let's see. So the setup is an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, so it's hitting the aperture vertically. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, and we can assume small angles so tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, so N is going to infinity. That means the polygon becomes a circle? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. Oh, right! So when N is very large, the aperture is effectively a circular one. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot and then alternating dark rings (minima) around it. The positions of these minima can be found using the formula for the minima in circular diffraction.

The formula for the m-th minimum in a circular aperture is given by sinθ = (mλ)/(πa), where m is the order (like m=1, 2, 3...). Wait, wait, I think the actual formula is that the minima occur at θ where (sinθ) = mλ/(πa), with m being 1, 2, 3,... So the first minimum is when m=1, second when m=2, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: Oh! No, wait. I think the formula for the minima in a single slit (rectangular) is different, but for a circular aperture, it's this mλ/(πa) thing. Let me think. Oh right, the single slit (Fraunhofer) diffraction minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, where 'a' is the slit width. But for a circular aperture, it's different because the pattern is two-dimensional and involves Bessel functions. The minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function's first zero is reached.

The first minimum (the smallest angular size) occurs when the order is 1, but wait, for the circular case, the first minimum is actually at θ where sinθ = λ/(πa) for m=1. Because the minima in the far field for a circular aperture are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1, and the first zero is at around 1.8412, but wait, no. Wait, the formula I remember is that the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occur when (a sinθ)/λ = (m^2), where m is an integer? Or is it when (a sinθ) = m λ? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me correct that. For a circular aperture, the angle θ for the minima is given by the condition that the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to its
