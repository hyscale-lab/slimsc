Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitude in electron-nuclear collisions. Hmm, phase shifts and all that... I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts: δ₀ = 90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The energy is 50 MeV electrons. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, right, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is related to the total cross-section, which is connected to the phase shifts. Oh wait, the imaginary part of f(0,0) specifically? Because the question says along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0°, φ=0°.

I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is something like Im f(θ=0, φ=0) = (1/(2m)) * sum ( δ_i * sin δ_i ), but wait, no, maybe it's the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by their sines and then multiplied by some constants.

Wait, I remember that the total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π |f|^2, but that's when you sum over all possible angular terms. But here, we're just looking for the imaginary part at a specific direction.

Another thought: The scattering amplitude f can be written in terms
