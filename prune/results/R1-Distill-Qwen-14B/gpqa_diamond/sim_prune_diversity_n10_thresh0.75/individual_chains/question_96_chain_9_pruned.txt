Okay, so I've got this question about black hole entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 1e62, B) 1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65. 

Wait, entropy of a black hole. Oh right, I remember that the entropy (S) of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, and the constants are the speed of light, Planck's constant, gravitational constant, and Boltzmann's constant. So first I need to find the area A.

But to find A, I need the radius of the event horizon, also called the Schwarzschild radius (r_s). The Schwarzschild radius is r_s = (2 G M)/(c²). So I need to find the mass M of the black hole first. Wait, how do I get M from the given angular size?

The angular size θ is given in degrees. Oh, right, we can use the small angle approximation which says that θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the arc length divided by the distance. So θ ≈ (2 r_s) / d. Wait, because the event horizon's size is 2r_s, right? Because the Schwarzschild radius is the radius, so the diameter is 2r_s. So the angular size would be (2 r_s) / d.

So θ (in radians) = (2 r_s) / d. Solving for r_s gives r_s = θ * d / 2.

But θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first. Oh wait, because θ is very small, 1e-17 degrees, perhaps I can approximate the conversion. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is θ_deg * (π/180).

Let me compute that. θ = 1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's (1e-17) * (π/180). Let me compute that: approximately 1e-17 * 1.745e-3 ≈ 1.745e-20 radians. Wait, but maybe for an order of magnitude, I can approximate π/180 as about 2e-3 (since π is ~3.14, so 3.14/(180) ≈ 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-2). So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 = 1.745e-19 radians. Hmm, but let me just keep it as an exact expression for now.

So, r_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, d is given as 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert parsecs into meters because the constants G and c are in SI units. So 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 pc. Each parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So now, putting it into r_s:

r_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

θ_rad is (1e-17 degrees) * (π / 180) radians/degree. So θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * (3.1416/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (pi/180) radians. So that's (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ 0.0174
