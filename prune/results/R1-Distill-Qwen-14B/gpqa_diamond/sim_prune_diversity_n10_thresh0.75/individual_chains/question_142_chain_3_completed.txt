Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). The options are various r vectors, but I'm not exactly sure how these relate to the density matrix.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are 2x2 for qubits. Each density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), and it's related to the density matrix elements.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, let me write that out:

ρ = (1/2) [ I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z ]

Since our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, let's compute this. Let me recall that |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with [1, 0; 0, 0], and |1⟩⟨1| is [0, 0; 0, 1]. Adding them together gives the identity matrix I, because 1/2 (I) would be [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2)*I, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

So ρ = I/2. Now, according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If I set these equal:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → I = I + r·σ → r·σ must be zero matrix.

Because I minus I is zero, so r·σ is the zero matrix. What does r·σ being zero imply about r?

The Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So r·σ = xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z.

For this sum to be zero, each component must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero and linearly independent. So xσ_x must be zero, which implies x=0. Similarly, y=0 and z=0.

So r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but why is the option B present? Oh, option B is (0,0,1). Maybe if someone confuses the z-component. Let me double-check.

The density matrix for a completely mixed state is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state, and it's represented by the origin on the Bloch sphere because r is zero. Yeah, so the Bloch vector is zero. So the correct answer is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing the two expressions for \(\rho\), we find that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, this implies \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
