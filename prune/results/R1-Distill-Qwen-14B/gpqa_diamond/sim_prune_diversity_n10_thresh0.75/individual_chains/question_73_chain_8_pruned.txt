Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Wait, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? And they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, we can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but I should make sure I get the order right. Since both are moving in the same direction, astronaut 1 is at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, so from 1's perspective, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator becomes 1 - (0.3c² / c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So that's the relative speed part. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So relative speed is probably 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut's total energy is their relativistic energy, which includes kinetic plus rest mass energy. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for him. v = 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.
