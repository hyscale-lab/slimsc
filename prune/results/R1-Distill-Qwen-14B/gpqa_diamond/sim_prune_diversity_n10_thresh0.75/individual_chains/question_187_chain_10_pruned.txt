Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each star whether they meet or exceed this S/N threshold.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used on the VLT (Very Large Telescope), and it's known for high-resolution spectroscopy. But how does its sensitivity work? I think the S/N depends on several factors like the star's brightness, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

The stars given are options a to f. Let's go through each one.

Option a) Canopus. I know Canopus is a bright star, a first-magnitude star. So it's definitely very bright. High magnitude means brighter, right? Wait, no, lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So Canopus is about magnitude 0.7, which is very bright. So with a bright star, the S/N should be high. It'll probably be detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, right? I think it's a second-magnitude star. So magnitude around 2.0. Bright, but less than Canopus. Still, I think it's bright enough for ESPRESSO. I'll say detectable.

Options c, d, e, f: all these are stars with V magnitude 15, but located at different distances. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the absolute magnitude is 15. Absolute magnitude (Mv) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. Then apparent magnitude (mv) depends on distance. So for each, I can calculate their apparent magnitude.

Wait, the formula is mv = Mv + 5 + 5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs. Oh wait, the formula is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d) - 5. Or wait, I think it's mv = Mv + 5*(log10(d) - 1). Because the formula is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d/10). So yes, that's correct.

So for each of these stars:

c) 10 pc: d=10. Then log10(10)=1. So mv=15 + 5*(1 -1) = 15. So mv=15.

d) 200 pc: log10(200)=2.3010. So mv=15 +5*(2.3010 -1)=15 +5*(1.3010)=15+6.505=21.505.

e) 5 pc: log10(5)=0.69897. mv=15 +5*(0.69897 -1)=15 +5*(-0.30103)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) 50 pc: log10(50)=1.69897. So mv=15 +5*(1.69897 -1)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15+3.49485â‰ˆ18.495.

Wait, let me double-check. Wait, the formula is mv = Mv +5 log10(d) -5? Or is it mv = Mv +5 (log10(d) -1 )? Let's see, Mv is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1. So mv = Mv +5*(1) -5 = Mv. Which makes sense, because that's the definition of absolute magnitude. So the formula is correct.

Wait, so for d=10, it's Mv. For d=5, it's Mv +5*(log10(5) -1). Let me recompute:

c) 10 pc: mv=15.

e)5 pc: log10(5)=0.69897. So mv=15 +5*(0.69897 -1 )=15 +5*(-0.30103)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) 50 pc: log10(50
