Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. And we have to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed for this. Then, determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, a base. When it dissolves in a strong acid, it will react. The acid will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt.

Let me write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl (since it's monobasic), the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, is that right? Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So, each OH- would react with an H+ to form water. So, 3 H+ ions for each Fe(OH)3.

So, the mole ratio is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 to 3 moles HCl.

Now, let's find the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.

So, Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, O is 3*16=48, H is 3*1=3. Adding up: 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles, which is 9.358e-4 moles.

Wait, wait, maybe more precisely: 0.1 / 106.85. Let me compute that. 0.1 ÷ 106.85 = about 0.0009358 moles.

Since the stoichiometry is 1:3, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 × 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

But wait, the HCl solution is 0.1 M. So, to find the volume (V) in liters: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So, volume = moles / Molarity.

Molarity is 0.1 M. So, V = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28.07 cm³.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So volume-wise, option C is the minimum volume needed. But wait, the question says 100 cm³ total volume. Did I miss that?

Wait, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, wait, that complicates things because the volume of the acid added will add to the solution. But wait, the problem says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution", but I'm not sure if the 100 cm³ is the final volume or the initial. Hmm, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the final solution is 100 cm³. So when adding the acid, the volume of the acid is added to whatever volume of solution is already there, but if the initial solution is 100 cm³, then adding the acid would change the volume. But wait, perhaps the dissolution is in 100 cm³ of solution, which already includes the acid. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction in terms of moles and concentrations.

Let me approach it again. So, Fe(OH)3 has a molar mass of 106.85 g/mol, as calculated earlier. So 0.1 g is 0.0009358 mol.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The moles of HCl needed for complete dissolution would be 3 × 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles / concentration: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L, which is 28.07 cm³.

But wait, the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So, when you add the acid to the solution, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So, perhaps the initial volume is 100 cm³, and adding the acid would make the total volume more than 100? But the question says the total
