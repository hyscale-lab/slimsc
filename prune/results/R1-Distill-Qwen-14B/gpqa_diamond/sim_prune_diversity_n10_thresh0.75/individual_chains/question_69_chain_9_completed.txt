Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Alright, the question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. I need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are from A to D, with various units.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to account for time dilation. So the lifetime observed (tau) is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

The formula for gamma is gamma = E/(m c²), but since we're given E and m in GeV, and c is in m/s, but maybe I can think in energy units where c is considered. Oh right, in particle physics, energy E is often given in GeV, and mass m is in GeV/c². So when calculating gamma, E in GeV equals gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²) → but wait, if the units are GeV and GeV/c², then gamma = E/(m), because E = gamma m c², so dividing both sides by m c² gives E/(m c²) = gamma. Wait, but the units don't quite add up. Maybe I need to be careful with units here.

Alternatively, perhaps gamma is simply E divided by (m c²). Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², let's see:

E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). So if E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV/c², then gamma = 27 / (3.41) → approximately 7.917.

Wait, but wait, units-wise, GeV divided by (GeV/c²) would give c². Because GeV/(GeV/c²) = c². So 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c²) ) = (27/3.41) c². Hmm, that's not right because gamma is dimensionless. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should re-express E in terms of m. Wait, because gamma is E/(m c²) in units with c=1? Or wait, perhaps I can think in natural units where c=1. Let me think again.

In particle physics, energy E (in GeV), mass m (in GeV/c²), and since c is involved, perhaps I should convert everything into consistent units.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think: gamma is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / (m c²). But E is given as 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) would be (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) → the GeV cancels, c² cancels, and we get 27/3.41 ≈ 7.918. So gamma is approximately 7.918.

Right, so the observed lifetime tau is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So tau = gamma * tau_0 → 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.918 *8 = approx 63.344 → so tau ≈6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 8e-16 multiplied by 7.918 is 63.344e-16, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds. That's the mean lifetime observed.

But how does this help me find the resolution needed? The resolution is the uncertainty in the position where the decay occurs, I think. But wait, the problem says what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So, the number of decays observed depends on how much of the path of the particle is within the region where the decay is recorded. If the decay length is too long, and the resolution is too poor, you might not detect a significant fraction.

Wait, so the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is c * tau. Since the lifetime is tau, the average distance is L = c * tau. But wait, no, because tau is the mean lifetime, so the average distance is L_avg = c * tau.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of the probability of a decay occurring within a certain length. The probability that the particle decays within a certain length x is 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we need to ensure that the decay vertex is within the resolution window, so that 30% of the decays are detected. Or maybe that the decay occurs within the chamber's detection volume enough to be observed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance that the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution must be better than that to capture the decay. Hmm.

Wait, no. The resolution refers to the precision with which we can measure the position of the decay. If the decay occurs over a certain length, and our detector can't resolve positions smaller than a certain delta x, we might miss some decays.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau_0. The lifetime observed is gamma * tau_0. The average lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average decay length would be L_avg = c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So if the decay length is longer than the resolution, then you can't observe it.

Wait, maybe the resolution is the uncertainty in the position measurement. Let me think: if the decay occurs over a length larger than the resolution, you might not see it. Or maybe the fraction of decays that occur within a certain length, determined by the resolution.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the distance that the particle travels before decaying, and ensure that the resolution is such that it can capture a certain fraction of that distance.

Wait, but the actual formula is to find the minimum resolution (delta x) such that the probability of the decay occurring within delta x is at least 30%. So, the probability P that the decay happens within a distance x is given by P = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

We need P >= 0.3. So 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)) → exp(-x/(c tau)) = 0.7 → take the natural log: -x/(c tau) = ln(0.7) → x = -c tau ln(0.7).

Wait, but ln(0.7) is negative, so x would be positive. Let me compute that: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667.

So x = c tau * 0.35667.

Wait, but the particle's speed is v = c beta, and beta is v/c. Since gamma is 7.918, and beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Wait, let me compute beta. Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is approximately 7.918 → gamma squared is about 62.7. So 1/gamma² is about 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 is 0.984. sqrt(0.984) is approx 0.99197. So beta is about 0.992.

Thus, the average velocity is approximately 0.992c.

But wait, to find the decay length, we can calculate L = beta gamma c tau_0. Because tau is gamma tau_0, and L = v tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, that's another approach. L = v * tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, yeah, because tau = gamma tau_0, and v = beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau_0.

But wait, that's another way of writing it. So for L, it's beta c gamma tau_0.

So using the numbers: beta is 0.992, c is approximately 3e8 m/s, gamma is 7.918, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Next, 7.918 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.3344e-15 s.

Multiply them together: 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s = 2.976e8 * 6.3344e-15 = let's compute that.

2.976e8 = 2.976 x 1e8

6.3344e-15 = 6.3344 x 1e-15

Multiply 2.976 x 6.3344 ≈ 18.85 (2.976 *6 =17.856; 2.976 *0.3344≈0.993 → total about 18.85)

So 18.85 x 1e8 * 1e-15 → 1e-7. So 18.85e-7 m → which is 1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, that's 1.885e-6 meters, which is 1.885 micrometers. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m (which is 2.08 micrometers), option B is 2.08e-9 m (nanometers), and so on.

Wait, but that's the average decay length. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we need the distance x such that P = 30% is the probability of the decay occurring within x.

Earlier, I thought that x is the distance for 30% probability, which would be L = c tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → but wait, the formula is P = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

So solving for x when P=0.3:

x = c tau * ln(1/(1-P)) → ln(1/(0.7)) = ln(10/7) ≈ 0.35667.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-calculate: 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)) = 0.3 → exp(-x/(c tau)) = 0.7 → -x/(c tau) = ln(0.7) → x = - c tau ln(0.7) → since ln(0.7) is negative, x becomes positive.

So x = c tau * ( - ln(0.7) ) → which is c tau * (0.35667).

Hmm. So c tau is the speed of light multiplied by the mean lifetime.

Wait, but tau is gamma tau_0. So c tau is c * gamma tau_0.

So x = c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7) → which is about 0.35667 * c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but earlier we calculated the average decay length L as beta gamma c tau_0, which is L = beta gamma c tau_0. So the average length is about 0.992 * 7.918 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, but in the x equation for 30% probability, we have x = c tau * 0.35667 → which is c gamma tau_0 * 0.35667.

Wait, so since L_avg is beta gamma c tau_0, and x is 0.35667 gamma c tau_0.

So x is approximately (0.35667 / beta) * L_avg.

Since beta is about 0.992, 0.35667/0.992 ≈ 0.3596.

So x is about 0.36 times the average decay length.

So given that, let me compute x.

Gamma is approx 7.918, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So c gamma tau_0 is 3e8 m/s *7.918 * 8e-16 s.

Compute that: 3e8 *7.918 = 2.3754e9, multiply by 8e-16 → 2.3754e9 *8e-16 = 1.9e-6 m.

Wait, 2.3754e9 * 8e-16 = 19e-7 → 1.9e-6 m.

So c gamma tau_0 is 1.9e-6 m.

So x is 0.35667 * c gamma tau_0 → 0.35667 *1.9e-6 → approx 0.677e-6 m, or 6.77e-7 m, which is about 0.677 micrometers.

Wait, but that's the x needed for 30% probability. Hmm, but the options don't seem to include that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute x more accurately. Let me go back.

Gamma is 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV → 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.918.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.918 * 8e-16 → 6.3344e-15 seconds.

The speed v is beta c, where beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Compute beta:

gamma^2 = (7.918)^2 ≈ 62.7 → 1/gamma^2 ≈ 0.016 → 1 - 0.016 = 0.984 → sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.99197. So beta≈0.992.

So v = 0.992c ≈ 0.992 *3e8 m/s → 2.976e8 m/s.

The average decay length L_avg is v * tau → 2.976e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s.

Compute that: 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = (2.976 *6.3344) * 1e-7.

2.976 *6.3344 ≈ 18.85 → 18.85e-7 m → 1.885e-6 m.

So L_avg ≈ 1.885e-6 m.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe 30% of the decays. So maybe the resolution needs to be such that at least 30% of decays happen within that resolution. So the resolution delta x is the distance such that the probability of decay within delta x is 30%.

Using the formula P = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

We set P = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)) → exp(-x/(c tau)) = 0.7 → x = -c tau ln(0.7) → ln(0.7) is about -0.35667.

So x = c tau * 0.35667 → c tau is 3e8 m/s * 6.3344e-15 s → 3e8 *6.3344e-15 = 1.90032e-6 m.

Multiply by 0.35667 → 0.35667 *1.90032e-6 ≈ 0.678e-6 m → 6.78e-7 m.

Wait, that's about 0.678 micrometers. But none of the options are close to that. The options are 2e-6 m (A), 2e-9 (B), 0.2 m (C), etc. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute delta x as the minimum required so that the fraction of decays observed is at least 30%. So delta x is set such that 30% of the decays occur within that distance. So we can find x where P=30% → 0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

Wait, but perhaps I should compute x as the distance where the cumulative probability is 30%. So x = c tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.35667.

So x = c tau *0.35667 → c tau is 3e8 m/s *6.3344e-15 s = 1.9003e-6 m. So x is 0.35667 *1.9003e-6 ≈ 0.678e-6 m → 6.78e-7 m.

That's about 0.678 micrometers, which is 6.78e-7 m. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the resolution needed is the decay length multiplied by a certain factor, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0, so the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

The length the particle travels before decaying is L = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

We can compute L: beta is approximately 0.992, gamma is 7.918, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 0.992 *3e8 *7.918 *8e-16.

Compute that:

0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8.

7.918 *8e-16 = 6.3344e-15.

Multiply 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 → 2.976e8 *6.3344e-15 = (2.976 *6.3344) * 1e-7 → 2.976 *6.3344 is about 18.85 → 18.85e-7 m → 1.885e-6 m → 1.885 micrometers.

So the average decay length is about 1.885 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution delta x is the distance that captures 30% of the decays. So if 30% of decays happen within delta x, then the minimum delta x would be such that the probability P is 30%.

Using the formula P = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)).

We have P=0.3:

0.3 = 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)) → exp(-x/(c tau)) = 0.7 → -x/(c tau) = ln(0.7) → x = -c tau ln(0.7) → x ≈ 0.35667 * c tau.

c tau is 3e8 m/s * (gamma tau_0) → gamma tau_0 is 7.918 *8e-16 =6.3344e-15 s.

c tau = 3e8 *6.3344e-15 → 1.9003e-6 m.

So x = 0.35667 *1.9003e-6 → ≈ 6.78e-7 m → 0.678 micrometers.

But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, but my calculation for x is 0.678 micrometers, which is about 6.78e-7 m. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should calculate x as the full decay length, not the 30% part. Because perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe any decay, which would require the decay length to be within the resolution. But that doesn't make sense because a decay length longer than the resolution would not be detectable.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution needed is the full decay length. Because if the decay occurs over a longer distance than the resolution, you can't see it. But that would be the case where you can't observe anything. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the mean decay length, and the resolution must be at least the mean length to observe a certain percentage of decays.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays are observed. So we set the probability P to be 30%, and find x.

Wait, another approach: the decay length distribution is exponential. The probability of decaying within a distance x is P = 1 - exp(-x/L_avg), where L_avg is the average decay length.

Wait, I think I got the formula wrong earlier. Since L_avg = c tau, the probability is P =1 - exp(-x/(L_avg)).

Wait, but tau is gamma tau_0, and L_avg is c tau = c gamma tau_0.

So, for P=0.3, 0.3 =1 - exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0)) → exp(-x/(c gamma tau_0))=0.7 → x= - c gamma tau_0 ln(0.7) → x= c gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7).

Compute that:

c gamma tau_0 =3e8 m/s *7.918 *8e-16 s → 3e8 *7.918 =2.3754e9 → multiply by 8e-16 → 2.3754e9 *8e-16 = 1.9e-6 m.

So x =1.9e-6 m * ln(1/0.7) → ln(1/0.7)= ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So x=1.9e-6 *0.3567 ≈ 0.6777e-6 m → 6.777e-7 m → 0.6777 micrometers.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the proper approach is to compute the minimum resolution delta x, which is the decay length such that the probability of the decay being within delta x is 30%. So delta x is x as computed above.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²). But E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c².

So E/(m c²) → 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV/c² * c² ) → the c² cancels, units GeV/GeV → unitless, so gamma is 27 /3.41 ≈7.918.

That's correct. So the gamma is 7.918.

Wait, maybe I should consider the velocity as beta c, but perhaps I should also compute beta correctly.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) → gamma=7.918 → gamma^2=62.7 → 1/gamma^2=0.016 → 1-0.016=0.984 → sqrt(0.984)=0.99197.

So beta is approximately 0.992.

So the decay length L_avg is beta gamma c tau_0 → 0.992 *7.918*3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that:

0.992 *7.918 ≈7.853.

7.853 *3e8 =2.3559e9.

2.3559e9 *8e-16 =1.8847e-6 m → 1.8847 micrometers.

So L_avg is approximately 1.8847 micrometers.

But the question is about the minimum resolution (delta x) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So if delta x is less than L_avg, then more decays will be observed.

Wait, perhaps the resolution is the typical distance over which the decay is spread. So the resolution has to be better (smaller) than the decay length to capture a significant fraction of decays.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is just over 2 micrometers. Option B is 2e-9 m, which is 2 nanometers.

Wait, perhaps the calculation involves using the mean decay length multiplied by a certain factor. For 30% probability, perhaps the x is about 0.3567 times the mean decay length.

Wait, in the formula, x = L_avg * (1 - exp(-x/L_avg)) → but no, earlier, x is the distance where P=30%, so x = L_avg * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the mean life and calculate the minimum decay length that corresponds to 30% detection.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average distance is L_avg = v * gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

But in the problem, to capture at least 30% of the decays, we need to ensure that the resolution is such that the number of decays within that resolution is 30% of the total. So the resolution delta x must be at least the length at which the cumulative probability reaches 30%.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the distance where the probability of decay is 30%, so delta x = x as calculated, 0.678e-6 m, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the uncertainty in the position measurement, which is the resolution. The resolution should be less than the average decay length to observe a certain fraction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper lifetime and the observed lifetime, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance necessary to resolve the decay, which is the proper length.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the length using the proper lifetime. So L = c tau_0 → in the rest frame, but that can't be right because the problem states the decay occurs in the Bubble Chamber, which is the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the mean decay length, which is 1.88e-6 m, which is approximately 1.88 micrometers. But the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 1.88e-6 is 1.88 micrometers. Option A is 2.08e-6, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma or beta. Let me recheck.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 → 27 ÷3.41 is:

3.41 ×7=23.87, 27−23.87=3.13 → 3.41 ×0.918≈3.13 → so 7.918 is correct.

So tau=gamma * tau_0=7.918 *8e-16=6.3344e-15 s.

Then, v=beta c=0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

L_avg =v * tau=2.976e8 *6.3344e-15= (2.976e8) * (6.3344e-15) = (2.976 *6.3344) * 1e-7 → 18.85 *1e-7 → 1.885e-6 m → 1.885 micrometers.

Hmm, so that's the average decay length. But the question asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution needs to be at least the distance where 30% of the decays occur. So using the formula P=30% → x= c tau * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x=1.9e-6 m *0.3567 →approx 0.678e-6 m.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Let me compute gamma more accurately: 27 /3.41 = 7.917888268.

Beta: sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2)) → gamma^2=7.917888268^2→ let me compute that.

7.9179^2 = (7.9)^2=62.41, plus 0.0179^2= approx 0.00032, plus 2*7.9*0.0179 → 2*7.9=15.8 *0.0179≈0.283.

So 62.41 + 0.283 + 0.00032 → approximately 62.6933.

So 1/gamma^2=1/62.6933≈0.01595.

So 1-0.01595=0.98405 → sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.992007.

So beta=0.992007.

So v=beta c=0.992007 *3e8=2.976021e8 m/s.

Tau=gamma tau_0=7.917888 *8e-16=6.33431e-15 s.

So L_avg =v * tau=2.976021e8 m/s *6.33431e-15 s.

Compute that: 2.976021e8 *6.33431e-15 = (2.976021 *6.33431) *1e-7.

2.976021 *6.33431 → approx 18.85. So 18.85e-7 m → 1.885e-6 m → 1.885 micrometers.

So, the average decay length is 1.885 micrometers.

The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution should be set to the point where 30% of the decays occur within that distance.

But my calculation yields x≈0.678 micrometers, and the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the full decay length (the average) and not the 30% part. Because if the resolution is at least 1.885 micrometers, you can observe all decays, but if the resolution is smaller, you only see a fraction. But the problem asks for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps if the resolution is the same as the average decay length, you can observe all decays (100%), but we only need 30%.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should calculate the minimum resolution as the decay length multiplied by the natural log factor.

Wait, another approach: The proper formula to find the decay length where P=30% is x = L_avg * ln(1/(1-P)).

So ln(1/0.7)≈0.3567. So x=1.885e-6 m *0.3567≈0.676e-6 m → 0.676 micrometers. But again, this is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of time, but I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again: 27 GeV /3.41 GeV/c² → 27 /3.41 =approx 7.918. Correct.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the energy is given as 27 GeV, which includes the rest mass. So E = gamma m c² → gamma = E/(m c²) → but since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², perhaps the calculation is gamma = (E) / (m c²) → but when E is in GeV and m in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) is (GeV) / ( GeV/c² * c² ) → GeV/(GeV) → unitless, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are given in a different way. Let me check the options again:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Compute gamma=27/3.41=7.917888.

Beta= sqrt(1-1/(7.917888)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/62.693) = sqrt(61.693/62.693)= sqrt(0.98405) → approx 0.992007.

Tau=gamma * tau_0 =7.917888 *8e-16=63.3431e-16=6.33431e-15 s.

v=beta c=0.992007 *3e8=2.976021e8 m/s.

L_avg= v * tau →2.976021e8 *6.33431e-15 → let's compute exactly.

2.976021e8 = 2.976021 x 1e8.

6.33431e-15 =6.33431 x1e-15.

So 2.976021 x6.33431 = let me compute it:

2.976021 *6 =17.856126.

2.976021 *0.33431 ≈ 0.9933.

So total is 17.856126 +0.9933 =18.8494.

So 18.8494e-7 m →1.88494e-6 m → approx 1.885e-6 m.

So the average decay length is 1.885 micrometers.

But the question is about the resolution needed to capture 30% of the decays. So the minimum resolution is the distance x where the probability P=30% → 0.3 =1 - exp(-x/(L_avg)) → x= L_avg * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → x=1.885e-6 m *0.3567≈0.676e-6 m.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I can't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the proper lifetime without considering gamma. Let me compute that.

Proper lifetime tau_0=8e-16 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So proper decay length L0= c tau_0 =3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m → 0.24 micrometers.

But that's way smaller than the options. So that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the proper decay length multiplied by a factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum time resolution, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, another thought: the resolution in the Bubble Chamber is the ability to detect the decay vertex. The decay vertex can be detected if the charged particles from the decay are produced within the resolution. The resolution is the smallest distance that can be reliably detected. So if the decay occurs over a larger distance than the resolution, it's harder to detect.

But how to relate that to the probability of detection?

Maybe the minimum resolution is the average decay length multiplied by the natural log factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for the decay length, which is L_avg=1.885e-6 m, which is approximately 2e-6 m, so option A is 2.08e-6 m. Maybe due to more precise calculation, it's 2.08e-6.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L_avg more accurately.

Compute gamma=27/3.41=7.917888268.

Beta= sqrt(1 -1/(7.917888268)^2)= sqrt(1 -1/(62.693))=sqrt(61.693/62.693)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992007.

Tau=7.917888268 *8e-16=63.3431e-16=6.33431e-15 s.

v=0.992007 *3e8=2.976021e8 m/s.

L_avg= v * tau=2.976021e8 *6.33431e-15 = (2.976021 *6.33431) *1e-7.

Compute 2.976021 *6.33431:

2.976021 *6=17.856126.

2.976021 *0.33431= Let's compute 0.3 *2.976021=0.8928063, 0.03431*2.976021≈0.09997.

So total 0.8928063 +0.09997≈0.992776.

So total is 17.856126 +0.992776=18.848902.

So L_avg=18.848902e-7 m=1.88489e-6 m=1.88489 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is A, 2.08e-6 m, as it's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh wait, that's a possibility. Because if the energy given is the kinetic energy K, then the total energy E is K + m c². Oh, that would change things.

Ah! Wait, the problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. Hmm, in particle physics, when someone says a particle has energy E, it could be the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic), or just the kinetic. If it's kinetic, then E=K=27 GeV, and the total energy is E_total = m c² + K =3.41 GeV +27 GeV=30.41 GeV.

In that case, gamma would be E_total/(m c²) =30.41 /3.41 ≈8.903.

Oh, that would change everything! Because I assumed E was the total energy, but if it's the kinetic energy, gamma is higher.

Let me recalculate with this possibility.

If E is the kinetic energy K=27 GeV:

E_total=K + m c²=27 GeV +3.41 GeV=30.41 GeV.

gamma= E_total/(m c²)=30.41 /3.41≈8.903.

So tau=gamma * tau_0=8.903 *8e-16=7.1224e-15 s.

Beta= sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2)= sqrt(1 -1/(8.903)^2)=sqrt(1-1/79.26)=sqrt(78.26/79.26)=sqrt(0.987)=approx 0.99347.

v=beta c=0.99347 *3e8=2.9804e8 m/s.

L_avg= v * tau=2.9804e8 *7.1224e-15 → let's compute:

2.9804e8 *7.1224e-15 = (2.9804 *7.1224) *1e-7.

2.9804 *7=20.8628, 2.9804 *0.1224≈0.3644 → total≈21.2272.

So 21.2272e-7 m=2.12272e-6 m →2.1227 micrometers.

So option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. Close to 2.12e-6.

Ah, that's it! So the problem must have intended that the energy given is the kinetic energy. Therefore, the correct gamma is approx 8.903, leading to L_avg=2.12e-6 m.

So the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays would be approximately 2.08e-6 m, which is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information and Formulas:
1. **Proper Lifetime**: \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \).
2. **Energy in the Bubble Chamber**: \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \).
3. **Mass of \( X^0 \)**: \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).
4. **Lorentz Factor**: \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \). Since \( E \) and \( m \) are given in units of GeV and GeV/\( c^2 \), \( \gamma \) simplifies to \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \).
5. **Observed Lifetime**: \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \).
6. **Average Decay Length**: \( L_{\text{avg}} = v \tau = \beta c \gamma \tau_0 \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \).
7. **Probability of Decay Within Distance \( x \)**: \( P = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{\text{avg}}}\right) \). For \( P = 0.3 \), \( x = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) \).

### Calculations:
1. **Compute \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.918.
   \]

2. **Compute \( \beta \):**
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.918^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.016} \approx 0.992.
   \]

3. **Compute \( \tau \):**
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.918 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( L_{\text{avg}} \):**
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau = 0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]
   Breaking this down:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} \approx 2.976 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.885 \, \mu\text{m}).
   \]

5. **Compute \( x \) for \( P = 0.3 \):**
   \[
   x = L_{\text{avg}} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right).
   \]
   Using \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.3567 \):
   \[
   x \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 0.3567 \approx 0.678 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (0.678 \, \mu\text{m}).
   \]

### Reinterpretation of Energy:
If the energy \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) is the **kinetic energy** rather than the total energy, the total energy becomes:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = K + m c^2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Recalculating \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{m} = \frac{30.41}{3.41} \approx 8.903.
\]
This increases \( \gamma \), leading to a longer decay length:
\[
L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau = 0.993 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8.903 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]
Breaking this down:
\[
L_{\text{avg}} \approx 2.980 \times 10^8 \cdot 7.122 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 2.12 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (2.12 \, \mu\text{m}).
\]

### Final Answer:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
