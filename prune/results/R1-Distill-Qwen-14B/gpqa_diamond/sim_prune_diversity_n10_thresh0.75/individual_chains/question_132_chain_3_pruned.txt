Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are various tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.

Hmm, I need to figure out which two compounds fit this NMR data.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think: Benzene has six carbons, so if the compound is C10H14, that leaves four more carbons. Oh wait, wait. Benzene is C6H6. So C10H14 is four carbons more than benzene. So each compound probably has four substituents attached to the benzene ring, but wait, no. Wait, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. 

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees: benzene (3) and one double bond or ring, but wait, benzene is a ring with three double bonds, so the degree is 4 for benzene. So each molecule has one benzene ring and four substituents? Wait, no, because benzene contributes 4 to the degree, so the remaining substituents must not add any more (like single bonds). So each substituent must be a methyl group, since that's an alkyl group with no double bonds.

Wait, the substituents can't add any more double bonds because the degree is already accounted for by benzene. So each substituent is probably a methyl group, because each methyl is CH3, which is a single-bonded group.

So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. But wait, looking at the options, some have diethyl groups. Oh wait, diethyl would be (CH2CH3)2, which is two substituents. So for C10H14: a benzene ring with four substituents, each being a methyl (so four methyl groups) would give C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. Because benzene is six carbons, four methyl adds four, so 10 in total. Alternatively, perhaps two substituents are ethyl groups. Each ethyl is two carbons, so two ethyls would contribute four carbons, making C6H5(C2H5)2, which is C6 + 4 = C10. But wait, molecular formula: benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would add 2*(2 carbons + 5 hydrogens) = 4C, 10H. So total formula would be C8H12? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is -C2H5, so each adds 2 C and 5 H. Two ethyl groups would add 4 C and 10 H. So the formula would be C6+4= C10, H6 +10= H16. But the given formula is C10H14. So that doesn't match. So diethyl benzene would have C8H10 (C6H5(C2H5)2 is C8H12? Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl adds 2 C and 7 H (since it's -CH2CH3, which is two carbons and seven hydrogens: CH2
