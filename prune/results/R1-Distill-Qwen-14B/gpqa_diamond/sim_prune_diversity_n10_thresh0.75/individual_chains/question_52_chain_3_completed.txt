Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. 

The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star's surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, alright, let's start from what I remember.

So the star has some parameters: its radius is 1.5 solar radii and mass 1.1 solar masses. But maybe those aren't directly relevant here. The important part is when it's without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but why does the overall temperature change when spots are present? Oh right, because the spots are cooler, so they emit less, but the unspotted areas are hotter. But the question is about the photosphere's effective temperature. Oh wait, when the spots are present, the star's overall photosphere effective temperature is lower. But wait, wait no—if 40% of the surface is cooler, the average temperature goes down. So the total flux (luminosity) would decrease because some parts are emitting less. But the question says the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but that's the average. 

But wait, the important part is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio (level1/level2) is lower. The question is, what's the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference.

Wait, but the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2. So it's n1/n2. Without spots, this ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. So the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots would be a number greater than 1.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. The energy difference between levels is related to the photon's wavelength via E=h c / λ. Hmm, but maybe we don't need that unless we're calculating the actual energy difference, but perhaps we can use approximate values.

Wait, the main point is that the ratio depends on the temperature. So when the star's photosphere is at a lower temperature (with spots), the ratio n1/n2 would be higher or lower? Let me think. The energy levels: let's say level 2 is higher than level 1, so E2 > E1. So (E2-E1) is positive. 

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)). So as temperature T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases (because denominator is exp(-ΔE/(kT)) ). So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). 

But wait, the ratio they're considering is n1/n2. So that would be 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) ).

When the temperature decreases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases. So exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, making n1/n2 larger. So the ratio n1/n2 is higher in lower temperatures.

Wait, but the question says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower (5500 K), but the ratio decreases. Wait, that's the opposite of what I just thought. Oh wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. So when the Teff is lower, the ratio is lower. That doesn't fit with what I thought. Wait, perhaps I got the levels wrong. Maybe level1 is higher than level2?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. Let's think: when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, if level 1 is higher in energy than level 2 (E1 > E2), then the energy difference ΔE would be positive. Let's see:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) )

So if T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would imply that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. So perhaps my initial assumption about the energy levels is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I got the ratio backwards. Let me re-express:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

If E1 > E2, then (E1-E2) is positive. So higher T means larger exponent, so n1/n2 increases. So when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases. But in the problem, when the star has spots, T decreases, and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Which would fit. Because when T is lower, the ratio is lower.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So with spots, Teff is 5500 K, lower than 6000 K. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower. So that aligns with the Boltzmann equation.

So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) is higher than with spots (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

So we can compute this factor.

Let me denote the ratio as R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are constants, the factor is [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k*5500) ) ] 

Which simplifies to exp[ (E1-E2)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]

Because the exponents subtract when you divide.

So let's compute this exponent:

Compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = (-5)/(330,000) )

So the exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * (-5)/(330,000)

Wait, wait, but let me compute (1/6000 - 1/5500):

Let me compute 1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4

1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5 (since 1.818-1.666=0.1515e-4 → 1.515e-5 with negative sign).

Wait, more accurately:

(1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/( 33,000,000 )= -1/(66,000) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (E1-E2)/(k) * (-1.515e-5 )

But wait, I can express this in terms of the wavelength. Because the transition is at λ=1448 Å. So the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1448e-10 ) 

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But the energy in terms of eV? Because sometimes k is expressed in eV/K.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute (ΔE)/(k) in terms of eV.

k is Boltzmann constant, about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

ΔE in eV: E_photon = hc/(λ e) where e is the elementary charge.

Wait, let me compute hc/(λ e):

h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, λ=1448e-10 m.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ e: 1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10 m * 1.602e-19 C )

Wait, because hc/(λ) is energy in joules, then to get eV, we need to divide by e (1.602e-19 C), because 1 eV = e * 1 V, and energy E = q V, so E(eV) = E(J)/e.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1448e-10 * 1.602e-19 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m * 1.602e-19 C = 1448 *1e-10 *1.602e-19 = 1448 * 1.602e-29 ≈ 2320.3e-29 = 2.3203e-26.

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 2.3203e-26 ≈ (1.9878 / 2.3203 ) * 10^( -25 +26 ) = approx 0.857 * 10^1 = 8.57 eV.

Wait, that seems high, but let's go with that for now.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

So (ΔE)/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K ) ≈ 8.57 /8.617e-5 ≈ approx 99,450 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 100,000? Let's compute 8.57 / 0.00008617.

Wait, 0.00008617 is approximately 8.617e-5. So 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617 ) * 1e5.

8.57/8.617 ≈ 0.9945. So 0.9945e5 = ~99,450 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈99,450 K.

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Wait, but earlier we found that (1/6000 -1/5500 ) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So exponent = 99,450 K * (-1.515e-5 ) 

Let me compute that:

99,450 * (-1.515e-5 ) = 99,450 * (-0.00001515 )

Calculating 99,450 * 0.00001515:

99,450 * 1.515e-5 = approximately (99,450 * 1.515 ) * 1e-5.

99,450 * 1.515 ≈ 99,450 * 1.5 is about 149,175, and 0.015 *99,450 ≈ 1,491.75. So total approx 150,666.75. Multiply by 1e-5 gives 1.5066675. So the exponent is approximately -1.50667.

So the factor is exp(-1.50667). Exp(-1.5) is about 0.2231. So the factor is approximately 0.223.

But wait, that's the factor for the ratio. Wait, no. Let me recap.

The factor is [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ] = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which we computed as exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 -1/5500) ) = exp(99450 K * (-1.515e-5 )) ) = exp( -1.506 )

Which is approximately 0.223.

So the ratio without spots is 0.223 times the ratio with spots. Wait, no. Wait, let's make it clear:

Actually, the factor is (R_without / R_with) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k)( (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (-500)/(33,000,000) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (-1/66,000) )

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait,  (1/6000 -1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -5/(330,000) = -1/(66,000) )

So (ΔE/k) = approx 99,450 K.

So (ΔE/k) * ( -1/(66,000) ) = -99,450 / 66,000 ≈ -1.5068.

So exp(-1.5068) ≈ approximately 0.223.

So the ratio without spots (R_without) is 0.223 times R_with (when spots are present). So R_without = 0.223 * R_with.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So it's R_without / R_with = 0.223? That would mean the ratio is lower without spots, but in our earlier analysis, when T is higher (6000 K), the ratio R (n1/n2) is higher. So R_without is higher than R_with.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck the exponent:

The exponent in the factor is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ). Since 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, the difference is negative. So the exponent is negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1. So R_without / R_with = exp( negative ), which is less than 1. But that would mean R_without is smaller than R_with, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that higher T gives higher R (since when T is 6000 K, R is higher).

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numerator and denominator wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the factor is [R_without] / [R_with] = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) ( (5500 -6000) / (6000 *5500) ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * (-500)/(33,000,000) ) )

Which is exp( negative ), so the factor is less than 1. So R_without is less than R_with. But that contradicts our expectation because, as T increases, R increases.

Wait, no. Wait, when T is higher (6000 K) than 5500 K, the ratio R = n1/n2 is higher. So R_without is higher than R_with. So R_without / R_with must be greater than 1.

Hmm, so either I made a mistake in the exponent or in the steps.

Wait, let me recast the problem. Let me define T1 =6000 K, T2=5500 K.

So R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (ΔE)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (ΔE)/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * ( (T2 - T1) )/(T1 T2) ) )

Wait, because 1/T1 - 1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, so since T2 < T1, (T2 - T1) is negative. So (1/T1 -1/T2 ) is negative. So the exponent is negative, so R1/R2 = exp(negative) <1. That can't be right because R1 should be larger than R2.

Wait, something's wrong here. Because higher T should lead to higher R.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Let me think again: if the transition is at 1448 Å, that's a photon of energy E = hc/λ. So E = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.55 eV. So the energy difference between the levels is 8.55 eV. So E2 = E1 +8.55 eV (assuming level 2 is higher). So ΔE = E2 - E1 =8.55 eV.

So in the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So R = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so R increases.

So R1 (at 6000 K) is higher than R2 (at 5500 K). So R1/R2 = [exp(ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [exp(ΔE/(k*5500)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Yes, that's correct. So the exponent is (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Which is (ΔE/k) * ( (5500 -6000) ) / (6000 *5500) )

Which is (ΔE/k) * (-500) / (33,000,000 )

Which is (ΔE/k) * (-1/ 66,000 )

Which is - (ΔE/(k * 66,000) )

So the exponent is negative, which means R1/R2 = exp(negative) <1.

Wait, that's the opposite of what we expect. Because R1 should be larger than R2, so R1/R2 should be >1. So that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I've mixed up level 1 and level 2. Let's suppose that level 1 is lower in energy than level 2. So ΔE is E2 - E1 =8.55 eV.

But then R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases because denominator is bigger, so the exponent is less negative. So R increases.

So R1 (T1=6000) is higher than R2 (T2=5500). So R1/R2 = exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )) )

So (ΔE/k) is about 99,450 K.

(T1 - T2) = 6000-5500=500 K.

T1 T2=6000*5500=33,000,000.

So exponent is 99,450 * (500) / 33e6 = (99,450 *500) / 33e6.

Compute numerator: 99,450 *500 = 49,725,000.

Denominator: 33,000,000.

So 49,725,000 / 33,000,000 = approx 1.5068.

So exponent is 1.5068.

So factor R1/R2= exp(1.5068) ≈ 4.5.

Because exp(1.5) is about 4.48 (since exp(1)=2.718, exp(1.5)=4.4817).

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which matches option C.

Ah! So I think I had a confusion between level 1 and level 2 earlier. The correct setup is when level 2 is higher, so n1/n2 is given by the Boltzmann factor with a negative exponent, but when considering the ratio R1/R2, the change in T affects it correctly.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000$ K) to having spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 5500$ K). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights of the levels, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
\]

where $T_1 = 6000$ K and $T_2 = 5500$ K. The energy difference $\Delta E$ is related to the wavelength of the transition ($\lambda = 1448$ Å) by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Using $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s, $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s, and $\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \times 10^{-10}$ m, $\Delta E$ is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting $\Delta E$ to electron volts (1 eV = $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ J), we find:

\[
\Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The term $\Delta E / k$ is then calculated using $k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5}$ eV/K:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,450 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting into the factor formula:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

The temperature difference term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (99,450)(-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.506.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.223.
\]

This result indicates that the ratio of $n_1/n_2$ decreases when the star has spots. However, the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. Since the ratio is smaller with spots, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{1}{0.223} \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
