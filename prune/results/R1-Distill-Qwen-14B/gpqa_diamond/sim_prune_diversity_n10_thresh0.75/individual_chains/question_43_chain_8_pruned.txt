Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with IUPAC nomenclature, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? Like positions 1,3,5 or 2,4,6. Hmm, wait, but benzene is a ring, so positions are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers for substituents.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. Oh wait, ortho is the adjacent positions. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then hydroxyl and dimethylamino would be at 2 and 3 or something? But wait, the description says both are ortho. So maybe two substituents next to COOH.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Since para is opposite, so if COOH is at position 1, then methoxy is at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile must be in a position such that both the hydroxyl and methoxy are adjacent to it. Wait, so if the nitrile is in position 3, and the hydroxyl is in position 2, then that's ortho. Methoxy is in position 4, which is adjacent to position 3. So position 3 would be the nitrile.

Wait, maybe I should sketch this out.

Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's number it in a way that the carboxylic acid is position 1. Then, the other substituents:

- Carboxylic acid: position 1
- Ortho to it: positions 2 and 6? Wait, wait, no. Ortho is the next positions, so for position 1, ortho is 2 and 6. So if at position 1, then position 2 and 6 are adjacent.

But the problem says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and
