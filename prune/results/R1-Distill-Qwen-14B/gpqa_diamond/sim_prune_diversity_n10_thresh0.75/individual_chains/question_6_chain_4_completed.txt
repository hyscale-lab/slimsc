Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It says a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r,θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options given.

Alright, I think I remember that potentials can sometimes be solved using separation of variables or by recognizing them as known potentials. So, let me try to analyze the given potential.

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. I can factor out the kr² term. So, V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let me compute the terms inside the brackets. 1/2 plus (3/2) cos²θ. Wait, maybe I can rewrite this in terms of multiple angles or something else familiar.

I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the term becomes:

1/2 + (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that: 1/2 + (3/2)(1/2) + (3/2)(cos2θ/2). So that's 1/2 + 3/4 + (3/4) cos2θ. Adding 1/2 and 3/4 gives 5/4. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ].

Hmm, wait, maybe I should think about this differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the terms differently.

Wait another approach: Maybe this potential can be rewritten as some combination of harmonic oscillator potentials. Because the harmonic oscillator is a common system in quantum mechanics, and it's separable.

Let me think: In two dimensions, a harmonic oscillator can have different forms. The standard isotropic 2D HO is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². But here, the potential has an angular dependence. So anisotropic, perhaps.

Wait, the given potential is V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor kr² out: kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Let me think about angular parts. The term 1/2 can be considered as 1/2 kr², and the other term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions, each depending on r and θ in a way that allows separation of variables.

Alternatively, looking at the entire expression, perhaps I can write it as a sum of terms, each of which resembles a harmonic oscillator in polar coordinates.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the potential might be separable in terms of r and θ. So, perhaps V(r,θ) can be written as a sum of functions each depending on r and θ separately. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]

Hmm, so the angular part is (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ). Wait, how can I express this? Let me think about the expansion in terms of spherical harmonics or Fourier series. Or perhaps express it in terms of Legendre polynomials, since cos terms often relate to them.

Wait, cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that:

V(r,θ) = kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets: 1/2 plus (3/2)(1/2) [since 1/2 is from the expansion of cos²θ] and (3/2)(cos2θ/2).

So that's 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4, and then (3/4) cos2θ. So V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire potential as a sum of terms that are functions of r multiplied by functions of θ.

Wait, another approach: Let's expand the potential in terms of cos(nθ) terms, but I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, perhaps it's a product of functions in r and θ. But in this case, the potential is a sum of terms, each of which is a function of r times a function of θ.

Wait, perhaps I can separate the potential into two parts: one that's isotropic (independent of θ) and another that's anisotropic (dependent on θ).

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as kr² [ (1/2) + (3/4)(1 + cos2θ) ].

Wait, let me compute it: (3/2) cos²θ = (3/2)*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 3/4 (1 + cos2θ). So, adding 1/2 to that gives 1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4, plus 3/4 cos2θ.

So, V(r,θ) = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Hmm, but how does that help me? Maybe I can think of this as a sum of terms that are products of functions depending on r and θ.

Wait, perhaps I can write the potential as a sum of two terms: a term proportional to 1 + cos2θ, and another term, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a perturbation on a harmonic oscillator. But maybe that's overcomplicating things.

Wait, another thought: In 2D polar coordinates, sometimes the Hamiltonian can be separated if the potential has terms that depend on r² cos(nθ), especially when the angular part can be expressed in terms of the quantum numbers.

Wait, I remember that when the potential has terms like cos(2θ), it may lead to a situation where the effective potential in the radial equation has a term proportional to cos(2θ) or something similar. But perhaps the way to approach this is to express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates, which might make the separation more straightforward.

Wait, let's try to express V(r,θ) in Cartesian coordinates. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x² / r².

Substituting back into V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x² / r²) ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x².

So that's (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is V = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k x². Since r² = x² + y², this expression can be written as V = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me compute that: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 +3/2) k x² ) + (1/2)k y².

Which is 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So, V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Hmm, so in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! That looks like a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Because in each direction, the potential is a quadratic function of x and y, but with different coefficients.

Wait, in an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, the potential is V = (1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². So in our case, comparing, I think that the potential can be written in terms of harmonic oscillators with different frequencies in x and y directions.

So, perhaps it's better to write the potential in terms of x and y, then the Hamiltonian would be H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, but wait: the potential terms are 2k x² and (1/2)k y². Let me see: in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So to get 2k x², perhaps that's (1/2) m ω_x² x², so 2k = (1/2) m ω_x² → ω_x² = 4k/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-component: (1/2)k y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So in the x-direction, the frequency is 2 sqrt(k/m), and in y-direction it's sqrt(k/m).

In such a case, the energy levels of an anisotropic oscillator are given by E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

So substituting the frequencies:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Let me compute that:

E = (2 n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, 2 sqrt(k/m) is 2 times sqrt(k/m), and the second term is sqrt(k/m). So combining the terms:

E = [2 n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Simplify inside the brackets: 2n_x + n_y + (1 + 1/2) → 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ℏ sqrt( k/m ). 

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m). So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I expressed V in Cartesian coordinates, I had V = (1/2) k r² + (3/2)k x². Then, since r² = x² + y², substituting gives (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Which is (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y². So that's (2k) x² + (k/2) y².

So yes, the potential is 2k x² + (k/2) y². So the frequencies are ω_x² = 2k m / m = 2k, no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, the potential is V = (1/2) m ω² x² for each direction. So for the x-component, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → ω_x² = (4k)/m. So ω_x = 2 sqrt( k/m ). Similarly, (k/2) y² = (1/2) m ω_y² y² → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt( k/m ).

So the energy for each direction is (n + 1/2) ℏ ω. So in x-direction, (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ), and in y: (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Adding those gives:

E = (2 n_x +1) (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2) (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which matches option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it is easier to analyze in Cartesian coordinates. Using the relations \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]
   Substituting \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]
   This represents a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the potential is quadratic in \( x \) and \( y \), but with different coefficients.

2. **Energy Levels of the Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   The energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega_y,
   \]
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, and \( \omega_x \), \( \omega_y \) are the angular frequencies in those directions.

3. **Determine the Frequencies**:  
   From the potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the angular frequencies are determined as:
   \[
   \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Substitute Frequencies into Energy Levels**:  
   Substituting \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) into the energy expression:
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

5. **Match with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy spectrum with the given options, the correct match is:
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The energy spectrum corresponds to **Option C**.
