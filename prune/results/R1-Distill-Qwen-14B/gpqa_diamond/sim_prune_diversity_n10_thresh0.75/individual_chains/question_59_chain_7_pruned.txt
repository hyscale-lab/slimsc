Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, that's a mixture of an acid and a base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should probably figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture.

Wait, but wait. I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess of either.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. Hmm, but when I mix it with HCl and Ba(OH)2, maybe the H+ from HCl will affect it. I'm getting ahead of myself; perhaps I should handle the neutralization first.

Next, HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since it's HCl, each mole gives one mole of H+ ions. So 0.08 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole provides two moles of OH-. So Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, mixing these, the H+ from HCl will neutralize OH- from Ba(OH)2. So let's calculate the neutralization reaction.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ neutralizes a mole of OH-. So H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So H+ is the limiting reactant here.

After reaction:
H+ will be 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 (since H+ is less).
OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles remaining.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So after neutralization, all H+ is used up, and OH- left is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. But wait, wait—no, wait. Because the H+ and OH- neutralize each other: when you have 0.08 H+ and 0.18 OH-, the H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-. So the remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

But wait, I also have the CH3COOH
