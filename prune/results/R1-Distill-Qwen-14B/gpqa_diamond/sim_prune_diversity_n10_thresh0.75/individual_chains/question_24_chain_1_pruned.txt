Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking down each part.

The problem is about different mixtures and reactions. So, let's parse it sentence by sentence.

First, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. Because alkenes can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize. So, mixture X must contain compounds with unsaturated bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum (Pt) under heat, a mixture Y is formed. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Wait, so Y's compounds don't have double bonds anymore? Or maybe they have single bonds but some other structure? Also, the formation of Y is due to a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, a disproportionation reaction involves a single species being both oxidized and reduced. So, one compound is split into two different products, one with a higher oxidation state and one lower.

Next, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, because 14.28 is approximately 1/7 of 100 (since 1/7 is about 14.2857%). So, the hydrogen content is 1/7 of the molecule's mass.

Hydrogenation typically adds hydrogen across double or triple bonds. So, if X has double bonds, hydrogenation would saturate them. Similarly for Y. But wait, Y's products don't decolorize bromine, so maybe Y's compounds are already saturated. But wait, when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z. So Y must have unsaturated bonds that are hydrogenated to become Z.

Wait, no. The problem says that the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So both X and Y, after hydrogenation, give the same product Z. That suggests that both X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, form the same compound.

But wait, mixture Y is from a disproportionation of X. Let me think about what that could be. Suppose X contains a compound with a functional group that can undergo both oxidation and reduction. For example, maybe an alkyne could undergo such a reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X has a diene or some other structure that can break down into different products.

Wait, the question also says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. So each molecule in X has double bonds that aren't conjugated. Maybe each is a simple alkene or alkyne? But if they're alkenes, they can decolorize bromine.

Let me structure this. Let's consider possible structures for X and Y.

Since the hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, and Z is a hydrocarbon with hydrogen mass fraction 14.28%, which is 1/7. So
