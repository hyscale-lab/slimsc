Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so maybe m is like 0 or ±1. The problem is asking about the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the energy difference ΔE of a hydrogen atom with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, wait—0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range. That's the Balmer series, right? Specifically, the H-alpha line, which is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which is blue-green, so that's the Balmer beta line maybe. But I'm not sure, but the exact line might not matter. I think the key is to find the energy difference ΔE corresponding to that wavelength.

So first, I need to calculate ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Okay, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers or 4.861 x 10^-7 meters.

Let me compute that E. So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m). Let me calculate the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Hmm, but I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so converting E to eV: 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So transitions that result in a photon of about 2.55 eV would be from a lower energy level to a higher one. Let me check: If E_photon is positive, it's the energy gained when an electron transitions from a lower to a higher energy level. So E_photon = E_final - E_initial. Let's say the electron was in level n_initial and goes to n_final > n_initial. So E_final is less negative than E_initial. For example, from n=2 to n=3: E_photon would be (−13.6/9) − (−13.6/4) )= −1.511 + 3.4 = 1.89 eV. Hmm, not 2.55. Oh wait, maybe n=3 to n=4? E_photon would be (−13.6/16) – (−13.6/9) )= −0.85 + 1.511 ≈ 0.661 eV. No, that's too low. Alternatively, perhaps n=1 to n=2: E_photon is (−13.6/4) – (−13.6) )= 3.4 – 13.6 = -10.2 eV? Wait, no, because ΔE is a positive value, so I think I might be getting confused here. Maybe I should just stick with the calculation I did earlier using the wavelength to get ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of an electron with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ / (2m_e)) * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately 2 for electrons), e is the charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m_e is the electron mass, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but I might be mixing some terms here. Alternatively, the energy due to the magnetic dipole interaction is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = (g_e μ_B) m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and g_e is the electron g-factor (about 2). So H = -μ·B = - g_e μ_B m B. Since B is in the z-direction, it's H = -g_e μ_B B m.

But wait, the problem says m is small. So m can be 0, ±1. So let's compute the expectation value of H, which is <H> = -g_e μ_B B m. Because the state is an eigenstate of m, the expectation value is just the eigenvalue. So <H> = - g_e μ_B B m.

Let's compute the magnitude. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-2
