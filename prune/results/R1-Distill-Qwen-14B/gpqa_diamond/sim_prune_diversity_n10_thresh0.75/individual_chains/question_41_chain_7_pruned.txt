Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of the light beam is relative to the observer. Oh right, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so I don't have to worry about that term.

Wait, okay, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going the same direction. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, but towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, if the light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, and the glass itself is moving towards the observer in the same direction as the beam, that means the glass is moving towards the observer, so it's moving in the direction opposite to the light's propagation? Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, so the glass is the medium. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. But the beam is moving towards the observer. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram.

Imagine the lab frame. The glass is moving towards the observer. The light beam is moving through this glass towards the observer. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, noâ€”wait: if the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (toward the observer), that would mean the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards the lab, same as the light.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of velocities. Let's denote the lab frame as S, and the glass's frame as S'. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at speed v_light' relative to the glass. Then, from S to S', the glass is moving at velocity v (let's say towards the observer, so positive v). Wait, but the direction matters here.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at
