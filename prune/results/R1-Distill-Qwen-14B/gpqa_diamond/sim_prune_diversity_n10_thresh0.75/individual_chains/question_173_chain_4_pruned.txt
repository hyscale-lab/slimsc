Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. The question gives me the uncertainty in position, Δx, and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v, but I'm not sure if I need that for the uncertainty in energy. Oh wait, maybe I should focus on the momentum uncertainty first because the Uncertainty Principle is about position and momentum.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. I can rearrange that to find Δp: Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). 

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Oh right, but sometimes people use ħ ≈ 1e-34 J·s for rough calculations. So Δx is given as 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Let me compute that.

So Δp ≈ (1e-34 J·s) / (2 * 0.1e-9 m) ) = 1e-34 / (2e-10) = 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, no: 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1e-34)/(2e-10) = (1/2) * 1e-24. So 0.5e-24 kg·m/s. That's 5e-25 kg·m/s, approximately.

Now, momentum p is related to energy. Since the electron is moving along x, and assuming non-relativistic speeds because 2e8 m/s is about 20% the speed of light, which is 3e8 m/s. So maybe I can use the non-relativistic energy equation: KE = p²/(2m). 

Wait, the problem is about the uncertainty in energy, so ΔE would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy. So ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m_e), where m_e is the mass of the electron, approximately 9.11e-31 kg.

So plugging in Δp as 5e-25 kg·m/s:

ΔE ≈ (5e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31 kg). Let's compute that.

First, square 5e-25: (5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49.

Divide that by (2 * 9.11e-31) = 1.822e-30.

So 2.5e-49 / 1.822e-30 = approximately (2.5 / 1.822) * 1e-19. Let me compute 2.5/1.822. 1.822 times 1.37 is about 2.5 (1.822 * 1.37 ≈ 2.5) because 1.822 * 1 =1.822, 0.3: 0.5466, so 1.822*1.3=2.3686, 1.37: 1.822 * 1.37 = 2.488. So about 1.37.

So 1.37e-19 J. Wait, but the options are in 1e-18, 1e-17, etc. Hmm, 1.37e-19 is about 1e-19. So the closest option is C, ~1e-19 J.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 m. So 2Δx is 0.2e-9 m.

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(0.2e-9) ) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) ) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05/2) * 1e-24. So that's 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. So earlier calculation was correct.

Then, (5.25e-25)^2 is (27.56e-50) = 2.756e-49.

Divided by (2 * 9.11e-31) = 1.822e-30. So 2.756e-49 / 1.822e-30 = approximately 1.51e-19 J.

So about 1.5e-19 J, which is 1.5e-19. That's 1.5 times 1e-19, so option C is ~1e-19 J, so that's the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic effects? But 2e8 m/s is about 0.67c (since c is ~3e8). So relativistic effects would be noticeable but maybe not dominant. Let's see: for relativistic speeds, energy is given by gamma * mc², but since the uncertainty is small, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is acceptable as an estimate.

Wait, but another approach: the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy would be (Δp)^2/(2m). So that's what I did.

Wait
