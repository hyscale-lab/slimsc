Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the total number of nucleons is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So that's a lithium-6 nucleus, I think. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is related to the kinetic energy, but wait, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the concept of relativistic energy. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, I need to calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Let me compute that. Let's see, v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, what's sqrt(0.0784)? Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, no, wait. 1/0.28 is 3.5714? Let me check: 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that more accurately. Because 0.28 * 3.5714 = 0.28*(3 + 0.5714) = 0.84 + 0.28*0.5714. 0.28 *0.5714 is approximately 0.16. So 0.84 + 0.16 is 1. So yes, gamma is approx 3.5714.

But wait, to be precise, let's compute 1/0.28. 0.28 is 28/100 =7/25. So 1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the total energy of the nucleus is gamma * m * c². But wait, the problem is about the energy of the RHIC, which likely refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Hmm, in particle accelerators, sometimes the kinetic energy is what's given, but when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So I need to check the question again.

The question says, "What is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?" So it's the energy that the RHIC imparts to the nucleus. I think in this context, they're referring to the kinetic energy. Because when you talk about the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy that's often specified. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy is used. Hmm. I need to clarify.

In accelerator physics, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. For example, in the case
