Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to calculate each one in terms of E, where E is pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared. Wait, I remember that the energy levels in a 1D infinite well are quantized and given by E_n = n²E, since E is the base energy unit for the ground state (n=1). So each particle in the well has energy proportional to the square of its quantum number.

But wait, there's more to it because there are four particles, and they have spin-1/2. Spin-1/2 means each can be either up or down. So the particles are fermions, right? They obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique combination of quantum numbers for their state.

Since it's a 1D well, each particle's quantum state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin. But wait, in 1D, the quantum state is just n and spin. For each energy level n, there are two possible spin states (up and down), so each n can hold two particles.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can accommodate two electrons (or whatever the particles are) since each can have spin up or down. So, for four particles, we'll have to distribute them into the lowest available energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion.

So the ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Let me think about how the particles fill up the states.

Each energy level is E_n = n²E. So the first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles (since two spins). The second level (n=2) can hold two more. So for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled with two particles each. But wait, wait, four particles in n=1 and n=2 would mean two each, but does that affect the total energy?

Wait, no. Each particle's energy is determined by their n. So for the ground state, all four particles would be in the lowest possible states without violating the exclusion principle.

Wait, but wait—each n can hold two particles (one spin up, one spin down). So for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled, each holding two particles.

So the total energy for the ground state would be 2 particles in n=1 and 2 particles in n=2. So the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? But wait, no. Each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So for two particles each, 2E and 8E, totaling 10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because four particles—two in n=1 and two in n=2. So the
