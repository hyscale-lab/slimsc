Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used for accelerating charged particles, right? But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a special type, so maybe it's different in some way.

The problem says that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It goes through two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], and the given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, okay, I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field, and the magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration. The key thing is that the frequency of the applied voltage must match the particle's cyclotron frequency for it to be accelerated each time it goes around the orbit.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, what's different? Oh right, I think synchrocyclotrons use a varying magnetic field instead of a fixed one. So the magnetic field increases as the particle gains energy, allowing it to continue accelerating over a longer period. That makes the synchrocyclotron suitable for accelerating particles to much higher energies compared to regular cyclotrons.

But back to the problem. The proton starts with almost
