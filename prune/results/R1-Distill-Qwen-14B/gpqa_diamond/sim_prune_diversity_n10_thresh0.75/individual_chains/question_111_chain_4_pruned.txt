Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what I can do.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out each step.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction this is. Oh, right! t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's an aldol addition or some kind of enolate formation. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So this probably is a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, the starting material is a ketone. So, cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that mentally. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So, the substituents are a bit bulky around position 2.

When a base like t-BuOK is present, it will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate can then attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition. But wait, which position will the enolate form? The ketone is at position 1, so the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. Hmm.

Wait, wait, no: wait, position 1 is the ketone. So the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. So the alpha protons are on positions 2 and 6. But in the starting compound, the 2-carbon has an ethyl and a methyl group, and 6 has a methyl. So, which site is more acidic? The more substituted alpha position might be a better site for enolate formation because of greater stabilization of the enolate.

Wait, but the more substituted site is position 2. Because the 2-position has more substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the alpha proton there is more acidic
