Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about reactions involving mCPBA and the products formed when (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with it. Then, after some work-up, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns, both standard and chiral ones.

Wait, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember that mCPBA is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right, so when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

So, the first reaction is with (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure would have the two methyl groups on opposite sides. Then, when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. But wait, mCPBA is a peracid, so it's an electrocyclic opening? Or is it a concerted addition? Oh, right, the epoxidation is a concerted process where the oxygen adds across the double bond. So the geometry of the double bond would influence the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, wait. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents (methyl groups) are on opposite sides. When epoxidized, the oxygen will bridge those two carbons. So the product would be an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. But wait, wait. mCPBA adds such that the oxygen comes from the same face? Or is it more about the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.

Wait, I think the configuration of the starting alkene affects the cis or trans arrangement in the epoxide. For example, when a trans double bond (E) reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide that forms would have the two new oxygen atoms adding on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. When an alkene is epoxidized with mCPBA, the addition is syn. Because mCPBA is an electrophilic peracid; the epoxidation occurs via a cyclic transition state where the two oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond. So the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is trans. Adding oxygen on the same face would lead to the two adjacent oxygen substituents being on the same side as well. Hmm, perhaps I should draw the structures.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, the positions would be 4 and 5. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Octene is an eight-carbon chain with a double bond. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but I'm probably not getting the structure right. Let me think, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, no. Wait, correction: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but more accurately, it would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be a 8-carbon chain with the double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be right because that would have 8 carbons with double bonds? Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but perhaps I should focus on the stereochemistry.

Wait, the key point is that (E)-oct-4-ene has the two substituents (methyl groups perhaps?) on opposite sides. Wait, wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-
