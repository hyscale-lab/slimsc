Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are 1,2,3,4. The choices are combinations of these. Let me remember what each symmetry means.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT extends it. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a yes.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? So if the theory is Lorentz symmetric, it should also include translations, hence Poincare. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so I'm not sure if all operators must respect Poincare. Or maybe they do because effective theories still need to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The effective theory is constructed by adding operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT should also respect it. So 2 (Poincare) would be correct.

Third, CP symmetry. Do all operators in SMEFT respect CP? Not necessarily. Wait, the SMEFT includes higher-dimensional operators, which could potentially violate CP. For example, in the SM, some processes like kaon oscill
