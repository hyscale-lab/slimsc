Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I need to compute both the relative speed and the total energy correctly to choose the right answer.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me check. Oh yeah, if object A is moving at u and object B at v (both in same direction), then the speed of A relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)).

So in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So the relative speed from astronaut 2's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that denominator. 0.6 *0.5 = 0.3, multiplied by c²/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857c, which is about 0.143c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now, for the total energy. I remember that the total energy of a relativistic object is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute the total energy for each astronaut and sum them.

Let me compute each astronaut's energy.

Astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for astronaut 1: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma * mass * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So if the mass is 2m, then E1 is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc²? Wait, no. Wait, 1.25 * 2m is 2.5m, so yes, E1 is 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The formula is E = gamma * (rest mass energy). So the rest mass energy is m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass. So for astronaut 1, m0 is 2m. So E1 = gamma * (2m) c².

So with gamma being 1.25, E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for astronaut 2: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

So the total energy E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E =5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc² and same relative speed. So the correct E is about 5.96, so the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up things.

Wait, for gamma in astronaut 2: 0.5c, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 is 3.4641 m. So E2 is indeed about 3.4641 mc².

Adding to E1's 2.5, that's 5.9641, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So yes, option C is the one with E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut 1 moves at \( u = 0.6c \) and astronaut 2 moves at \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
Astronaut 1 has mass \( 2m \) and speed \( 0.6c \). Calculate \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

The energy of astronaut 1 is:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
Astronaut 2 has mass \( 3m \) and speed \( 0.5c \). Calculate \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of astronaut 2 is:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy of the System
The total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \).

This matches **Option C**, which states \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \) and \( E = 5.96m c^2 \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
