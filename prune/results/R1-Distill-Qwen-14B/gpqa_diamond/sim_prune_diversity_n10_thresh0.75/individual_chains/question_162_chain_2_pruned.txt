Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that metrics are used in general relativity and differential geometry to describe the curvature of spacetime, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so it's a two-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy. I think the line element in two dimensions is usually written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². In this case, it looks like it's diagonal with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the cross term is zero, so g_{xy}=0. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its properties are different from a regular sphere. But how does that relate to the metric given?

I remember that the area of a sphere in two dimensions (which is a circle) is 2πr. But wait, a pseudosphere isn't a sphere; it's a hyperbolic surface. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents some kind of hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the metric here has a denominator (4 - x² - y²).
