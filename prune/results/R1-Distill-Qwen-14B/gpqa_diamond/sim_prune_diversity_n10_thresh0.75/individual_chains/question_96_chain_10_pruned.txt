Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 1e62, B) 1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65 J/K.

Hmm, I think entropy for a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, sometimes it's written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). So the key here is to find the area A of the event horizon.

The event horizon's radius is the Schwarzschild radius R_s. Schwarzschild radius R_s = (2 G M)/(c^2). But how do I find the mass M from the given angular size and distance?

Wait, the angular size θ is given, so I can find the actual size of the event horizon. The formula relating angular size, actual size, and distance is θ ≈ (size)/(distance), assuming θ is small, which it is here (1e-17 degrees is super tiny).

So θ (in radians) is approximately equal to (diameter of event horizon) / distance. Wait, the diameter is 2 R_s, so θ ≈ (2 R_s)/d.

Wait, but wait. The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ (actual size)/(distance). So the actual size is θ * d.

Let me get the units right. But θ is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians first. Because 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ (rad) = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈
