Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spin states, but I remember that for electrons, the spin states are typically represented as two-component vectors.

First, I should recall what the expectation value is. The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. Oh right, it's <ψ|Ô|ψ>. 

The operator for spin in the y-direction, S_y, is given in the question as the Pauli matrix sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, because I remember that for electrons, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. Let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The state vector is given as (3i, 4). Wait, in vector form, that's a column vector, right? So ψ = [3i; 4]. But to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Wait, let's write down ψ as a column vector:
ψ = [3i; 4]

So the conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i, but when we take the transpose, the row vector is [3i*, 4*]. So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ]? Because 3i becomes -3i when conjugated, and 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The state is (3i,4), which as a column vector is [3i;4]. So the conjugate is
