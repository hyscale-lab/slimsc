Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The problem has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B, each with their own starting materials and reagents. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the catalyst. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this probably involves some kind of elimination or maybe a cycloaddition. Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone with substituents. Oh, right, when a ketone is treated with a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is a good dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a Michael addition? Or perhaps a conjugate addition.

Wait, t-BuOK is a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating something. Oh! Wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and the ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Let me draw that mentally. Position 1 is the carbonyl, so position 2 is adjacent. So the structure would have a six-membered ring, with a ketone at C1, an ethyl group at C2, and methyl groups at C2 and C6. Wait, no: "2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one" means that the substituents on the cyclohexane ring are ethyl and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, and the ketone is at position 1. So the carbonyl is at C1, and C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. Wait, no, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that at C2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group, making that carbon have three substituents (since cyclohexane is a six-membered ring). Wait, no, cyclohexane in
