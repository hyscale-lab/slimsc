Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and the comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, sometimes the emission lines are broad and can indicate certain things about their redshift. Wait, the peak at 790 nm—maybe that's a specific emission line that's been redshifted?

Oh right! There's this emission line called the Lyman-alpha line, which is usually at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, 790 nm is much longer. That makes me think of the Balmer series in hydrogen. Let me think: the Balmer-alpha line is H-alpha, which is at around 656 nm in the optical. But 790 is a bit longer than that. Maybe it's another line, like the Balmer series or something else.

Wait, another thought: 790 nm is in the near-infrared. I've heard that the Lyman series, specifically Lyman-alpha, is a prominent line in quasars. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer than the rest wavelength. So maybe the quasar's light is redshifted, and this peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha line at z = (observed - rest)/(rest). Let's calculate that.

The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So the redshift z is (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ (668.4) / 121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z is roughly 5.5.

Wait, but I might have messed up the calculation. Let me do it more accurately. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.498, so z = 6.498 - 1 = 5.498, so about 5.5. So the redshift is around 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at a=1 (which is the current scale factor) to
