Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the scenario is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited observing time. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They share the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

Wait, the host stars are different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. But the same radius is important here.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / (a_planet * (1 - e)), but since both have circular orbits, e is zero. So it's (R_p + R_s) / a_p. But wait, no, actually the formula I'm thinking of is more like R_p / (R_s * a_p), or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Wait, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a_p) / (R_s / a_p) ) ? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s) / a_p. Wait, no, maybe the formula is (R_p / a_p) divided by (R_s / a_p), which would just be R_p / R_s. But that can't be right because the orbital period (and hence a_p) affects the probability somehow.

Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star plus planet to the orbital distance. Or rather, it's the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk, but more accurately, it's the probability that the orbit is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. Oh right, the exact probability is (R_s + R_p) / a_p, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's roughly R_s / a_p. Wait, no, actually, the formula I recall is that the probability is (R_p / a_p) / (R_s / a_p) )? No, that's not quite right. Let me get this straight.

The transit probability P is given by (R_p + R_s) / a_p * (1 / (1 - e)), but e is zero here. So P = (R_p + R_s) / a_p. But wait, R_p is much smaller than R_s, so this is approximately R_s / a_p. But wait, that can't be right because the transit probability shouldn't just depend on R_s and a_p. I think I'm getting this confused.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is the ratio of the size of the star to the planet's orbital distance. Or more accurately, the probability is (R_star) / (a_p * (1 - e)) ), but because e=0, it's R_star / a_p. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because units wouldn't match. Because a_p is in astronomical units, and R_star is in radius. Oh, right, R_star is in terms of the same units as a_p.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is the probability of transit is (R_star / a_p) * ( (R_p / R_star) / (1 + sqrt( (R_p / R_star)^2 + (R_p / a_p)^2 )) )) ). No, maybe that's more complicated than I remember. Alternatively, the transit probability is often approximated as (R_p / R_s) divided by (a_p / R_s), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think I need to recall the correct formula. The transit probability (for a randomly oriented orbit) is given by (R_s + R_p) / a_p, but since R_p is small, it's roughly R_s / a_p. Wait, but if that's the case, then the probability is proportional to R_s divided by a_p.

Wait, but that would imply that a planet with a smaller a_p (closer in) would have a higher probability to transit. Because R_s is in the numerator and a_p is in the denominator. So for a given star, a closer planet has a higher transit probability.

But wait, let me think about the real formula. I think the exact formula is P = (R_s + R_p) / (a_p * (1 - e)) ) Ã— (1 + (R_s + R_p)/a_p )^{-1/2} ), but since e is
