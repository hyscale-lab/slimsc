Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. We're given some elemental abundances using the EW method, assuming LTE. The given data are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → wait, wait, 12 plus log equals 7.5, so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 12 + log10(...) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 → that's -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → so log is 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1/nSi_2]?

Wait, no, wait. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So it's [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], but wait, wait. Let me think. Actually, no, the ratio is (nSi in Star1) / (nSi in Star2). Or is it [Si/Fe] for each star?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms. So perhaps I need to compute [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio.

Wait, let's think about each star's composition.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → which means [Fe/H] is 0. So the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nFe_1/nH_1)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) ) = 0. So the ratio is 1. Therefore, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun /nY_sun ). So for Star_1:

log
