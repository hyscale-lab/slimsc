Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

The question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3- or maybe HPO4^2-? Hmm, wait. Orthophosphate usually refers to PO4^3-, but sometimes in solution it can be in different forms depending on the pH. I'll need to figure that out.

The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so that's good. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. These are the dissociation constants. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, and each deprotonation step has its own Ka.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it can form a buffer solution. So in this case, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their forms in solution.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or a base (gain a proton to become H3PO4). So its behavior depends on the solution's pH.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which can act as an acid (donate a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (gain a proton to become H2PO4^-).

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. This sounds like a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but which one is the acid and which is the base here? Well, H2PO4^- can donate a proton (so it's an acid) and HPO4^2- can accept a proton (so it's a base). So they form a buffer around the pH where their concentrations are significant.

The next step is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. To get PO4^3-, we need HPO4^2- to deprotonate. But wait, does that happen in this solution? Well, the presence of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- suggests that the solution is somewhere around the second dissociation step of H3PO4. Let me think about the Ka values.

The relevant Ka here would be Ka2 because H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. H3PO4 loses a proton to become H2PO4^- (Ka1), which loses another to become HPO4^2- (Ka2), and then another to become PO4^3- (Ka3). So, the H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate, and HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate. So, in solution, both are present, and the solution is a buffer between the second and third dissociation steps.

Wait, but
