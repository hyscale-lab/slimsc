Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) given by ½ kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often plays a significant role in determining the energy levels. Since this is a two-dimensional problem, maybe it's similar to the particle in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator but with some added terms because of the θ dependence.

Wait, the potential V(r,θ) is given as the sum of two terms: ½ kr² and (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me try to rewrite this to see if it can be expressed in a more familiar form.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Let me compute the coefficient inside the brackets: 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ.

Wait, what's another way to write 3/2 cos²θ? I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets. First, 3/2 multiplied by (1 + cos2θ)/2 is (3/4)(1 + cos2θ). So adding 1/2 to that:

1/2 = 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4, and then 3/4 cos2θ. So V = kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ].

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Wait, maybe I can separate this into radial and angular parts. But in spherical coordinates, perhaps I can express this as a sum of terms involving r² and cos2θ. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to switch into Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be expressed as a combination of terms that can be treated as harmonic oscillators in different directions. Let me think: in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p²_{radial} )/(2m) + (p²_θ)/(2m r²) ), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to switch to Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about that. Since r² is x² + y², and cos²θ is (x²)/(x²+y²). Let's see:

Wait, cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² (x²/(r²)). Simplifying this, since r² = x² + y², so:

V = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x².

So substituting, the potential is (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let me expand that: (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²). Adding the x² terms together: (1/2 + 3/2)k x² = 2k x². And the y² term is (1/2)k y².

So the potential becomes V = 2k x² + (1/2)k y² + (1/2)k (x² + y²) ??? Wait, no, that substitution seems off. Wait, wait, no: Wait, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me double-check.

Wait, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's express it in terms of x and y.

Since r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²).

So substituting, V becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²)(x²/(x²+y²)).

Simplify the second term: (3/2)k x².

So the entire potential is (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me combine the terms:

The x² terms: (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² = 2k x².

The y² term remains (1/2 k) y².

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, but with different spring constants.

In the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², which can be written as (sqrt(2k)) )² x², so the effective spring constant is sqrt(2k) multiplied by sqrt(2k) (but perhaps more accurately, the spring constant is 2k). Similarly, the y potential is (1/2)k y², so the spring constant for y is k.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ℏ ω, where ω is the angular frequency. For a spring with constant k, ω
