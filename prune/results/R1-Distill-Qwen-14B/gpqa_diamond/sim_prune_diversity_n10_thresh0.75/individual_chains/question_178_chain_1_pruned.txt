Okay, so I have this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is 𝓛_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably for electromagnetism since it's antisymmetric. So this looks like an interaction term between a spinor field (like electrons) and a vector field (like photons), maybe something similar to the Dirac equation coupled with electromagnetism.

Wait, but in the usual QED Lagrangian, the interaction term is j^μ A_μ, where j is the current. For Dirac fields, j is something like ψ̄ γ^μ ψ. But this term here has σ_{μν}, which is a tensor made from the gamma matrices. Oh right, σ_{μν} is related to the angular momentum operators in QFT, and it appears in the coupling of spin-½ particles to certain fields. So this might be a higher-dimensional interaction.

Now, the first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I need to remember how to calculate the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which has dimension [Mass]^{-4} in 4D). Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action (integral of 𝓛) is dimensionless (in 4 dimensions, the integral gives dimension [Lagrangian]^{-4} * [Measure]^{4}... wait, maybe I should think in terms of each term's dimension.

Wait, no. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it (d^4 x), the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4.

Let me break it down. Each field has a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac equation leads to fields with [ψ] = [Mass]^{3/2}. Similarly, the field strength F^{μν} for a gauge field like A has dimension 2 because F is the derivative of A plus terms in A squared. So [F] = 2.

Now, let's look at each part of the term. ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, so [ψ̄] = 3/2. The σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're matrices, not fields). So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] = 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 = 3. Then we have F^{μν}, which has dimension 2. So the term without κ is dimension 3 + 2 = 5. But the entire Lagrangian term must be dimension 4, so κ must have dimension [κ] = 4 - 5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1. That rules out options B and D, which say [κ] is 1. So the possible answers are A and C.

Next, determining whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the coupling constants' mass dimensions. In general, a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have
