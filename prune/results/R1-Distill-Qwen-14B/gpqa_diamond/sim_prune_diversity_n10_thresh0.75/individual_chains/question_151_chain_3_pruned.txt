Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable P is represented by a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability that measuring P will yield 0.

Hmm, right. So, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the observable is given by matrix P, and I need to find the probability of measuring 0. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of P because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues.

So the matrix P is:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Once I have the eigenvalues, the possible outcomes are those, and 0 is one of them, I suppose. Then I can find the eigenvector corresponding to 0 and calculate the probability.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is constructed in a way that its eigenvalues are 1 and -1, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix P is a projection operator. Wait, but looking at the elements, let me check if P is Hermitian, which it should be since it's an observable.

Each element P_ij is real, except for the 1/sqrt(2) terms. Wait, no, wait: in the matrix, the elements are real. So P is Hermitian because the matrix is symmetric. Because the transpose of P would have the same elements, so P equals its transpose. So yes, it's Hermitian, which is good because observables are Hermitian.

Now, for Hermitian operators, the eigenvalues are real, which is correct.

So, the strategy is: find the eigenvalues of P, check which one is 0, then find the eigenvector for that eigenvalue. Then, project the given state
