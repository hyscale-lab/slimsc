Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum looks correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and integrate to 1H together. So, each is about half a proton? Wait, but the integral is 1H total, so each is 0.5. That's interesting.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh, because if they were coupling, their splitting would show that. But since it's ruled out, maybe it's something else. Then, looking at the LC-MS: two peaks of same intensity, same mass. So the mass is correct for the expected molecule. So, it's not a fragment or a different compound.

So what could cause the same alpha-proton to split into two peaks in NMR? Maybe diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are in a diastereomer, so each would have a different environment. But wait, in that case, the integral would add up to 2H if each diastereomer has one proton. But wait, the question says the integral together is 1H. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling that isn't J-coupling, like something else.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass, so it's not a different mass. Precursors would have a different mass, probably. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, but for NMR, if the compound is a pair of enantiomers, the protons in the same environment would be equivalent. So for an alpha-proton, in each enantiomer, it would be the same, so the NMR would show a single peak. Unless something else is happening. Wait, but if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, maybe the protons are equivalent. Alternatively, if the alpha-proton is in a chiral environment, perhaps in each enantiomer, it's the same, so they wouldn't
