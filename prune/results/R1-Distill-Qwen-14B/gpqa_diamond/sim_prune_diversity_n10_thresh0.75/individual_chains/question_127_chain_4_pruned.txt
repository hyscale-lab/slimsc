Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that heating can cause certain reactions, maybe elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, the compound is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Breaking that down, nona- means nine carbons, and it's a diene with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The substituent is a butyl group attached at the 5th carbon. So the structure must be something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, nona is nine carbons, so the main chain is nine carbons long. The substituent is a butyl group on the 5th carbon.

Wait, if it's 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but where are the double bonds? Oh, nona-2,6-diene would have double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3, but wait, the substituent is on carbon 5. So the substituent is a but
