Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, we're asked what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

Hmm, right, so the detector's radius is 30 meters. I think I need to relate the distance the particles travel before decaying to the detector's size.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is important. The particles will decay after traveling a certain distance, which depends on their velocity and lifetime. The faster they go (higher Lorentz factor), the longer they live from our (lab) frame's perspective, so they can travel further.

So, let's think about the time it takes for a particle to reach the inner wall. The distance is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. The time the particle takes to travel this distance is distance divided by velocity. But velocity is a function of the Lorentz factor.

Wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So I can approximate v ≈ c. So the time t it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 m / (c). Since c is about 3e8 m/s, t is around 1e-7 seconds or so. But wait, the exact number might not matter because we're comparing two scenarios.

But wait, the key is the proper lifetime of the particle. The particles decay after a certain proper time, tau. From our frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is v * t. Since v ≈ c, that's c * gamma * tau. So the average distance L is c * gamma * tau.

If the detector radius is 30 meters, then the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the inner walls, its average lifetime must be such that L >= 30 m.

Wait, but the question says that on average, one third of the particles reach the walls. So I think this relates to the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is related to the ratio of the distance they can travel to the actual distance.

Alternatively, the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Wait, no, more precisely: the probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. The decay probability is modeled by a decay law. The number of particles remaining after time t is N = N0 exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). If t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall (t_wall), then the probability of reaching the wall is exp(-t_wall/(gamma tau)).

So, the problem states that when gamma is 20, the probability of reaching the wall is one third. So:

exp(-t_wall / (gamma tau)) = 1/3

We can take the natural log of both sides:

-t_wall / (gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)

Multiply both sides by -1:

t_wall / (gamma tau) = ln(3)

So t_wall = gamma tau ln(3)

Wait, no, wait: No, the equation is exp(-t_wall/(gamma tau)) = 1/3. Taking the log:

-t_wall/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) → -t_wall/(gamma tau) = -ln(3) → t_wall/(gamma tau) = ln(3)
