Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a polygon with N sides. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm, and we can approximate tanθ as θ since the angles are small. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, the setup is similar to the diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture, but here it's a polygon. When N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, right? But how does that affect the diffraction pattern?

I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, no, wait. Circular apertures have the first minimum at θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ/(π a) or something like that? No, wait, I think the first minimum for a single slit is at sinθ = λ/a. Oh wait no, that's for a single slit of width 'a'. But for a circular aperture, the formula is different.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern should resemble that of a circular aperture. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Or am I?

Wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture
