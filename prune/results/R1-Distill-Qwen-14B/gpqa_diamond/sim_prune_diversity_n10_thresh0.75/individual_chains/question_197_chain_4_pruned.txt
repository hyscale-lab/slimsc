Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product formed when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, right. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, actually, I think that when an ester reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution to form an acid. Oh wait, no, maybe it's more like a cleavage or something. Or wait, another possibility: I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an ester to an acid, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data given.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm^-1, which is a broad region that usually indicates O-H stretches, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Oh wait, but I remember that in carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300 as a broad peak. But wait, another possibility: an ester would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1. There's also a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone
