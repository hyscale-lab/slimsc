Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question involves two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, found them. The star's properties are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. Interesting.

The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. But wait, how do I find the distance?

Wait, the planets cause Doppler shifts. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement from the planet's gravity. The shift relates to the planet's mass and the distance of the planet from the star.

So for each planet, the RV method gives us an idea of their masses and the semi-major axis (which is the distance since the orbits are circular). The problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the line OI at 6300 Å. Planet2's shift is up to 0.04 Å.

I think the RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude (K) relates to the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of radial velocity semi-amplitude K.

The formula for K is: K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)} )

But that seems complicated. I remember that for a circular orbit and edge-on (so sin i = 1), the formula simplifies. Alternatively, since both planets are detected via the same method, perhaps the ratio of their velocities can be related to their masses and their distances from the star.

Wait, let me think. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star toward or away from us. The star's velocity is given by the radial velocity semi-amplitude K. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (P^(1/3) ) * (1 / c) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / a^(1/3)) ), but I might be getting that wrong. Maybe a better approach is to set up the ratio for the two planets.

Wait, the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the distance (semi-major axis) from the star. So, for the same star, if we have two planets with different RV shifts, their K values are different. The ratio of K1 to K2 will be (M1/a1)^(1/3) / (M2/a2)^(1/3) ) assuming other factors are similar. Wait, maybe it's K proportional to (M_p / a)^(1/3) ? Because K is given by (v) which is 2π a / P, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (as planetary masses are much less than stellar), 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so it's approximately K ≈ (2 pi G)^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But I don't know the orbital periods, so maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2, the distances, from the ratio of the RV shifts.

Wait, the question gives us the Doppler shifts for each planet. The shifts are 0.03 Å for planet 1 and 0.04 Å for planet 2. But Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So if the same spectral line is observed, the same lambda, so delta_lambda is proportional to v. So the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the shift.

But wait, the star's velocity is K. So the shift
