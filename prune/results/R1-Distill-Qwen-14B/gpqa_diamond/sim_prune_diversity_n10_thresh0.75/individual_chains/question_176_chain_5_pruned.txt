Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum concepts, but let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, which are column vectors, and they should be normalized. Oh, right, the norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Wait, wait a second: in quantum states, the components are complex numbers, but here they are real. So, the state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. I think I need to normalize it first. So the actual state vector is (1/√6)*(-1, 2, 1). Because the norm is sqrt(6), so to make it a unit vector, each component is divided by sqrt(6).

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P has:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0.
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2.
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Operator Q has:
First row: 1, 0, 0.
Second row: 0, 0, 0.
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

Wait, Q looks like a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is: if we first measure P
