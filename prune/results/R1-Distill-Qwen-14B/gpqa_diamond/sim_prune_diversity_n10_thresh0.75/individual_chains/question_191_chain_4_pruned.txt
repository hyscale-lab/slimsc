Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (a CH2OH attached). And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2?), no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be the middle carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C( with a double bond to CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-) something, right? Wait, no. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2-) attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like:

CH2=C-CH2- but wait, the substituent is at the 2 position. So, in prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-C(=CH2). No, wait. Let me number the propene. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So 1 is the first carbon, 2 is the middle. So substituent would be CH2-C(CH2) attached? No, perhaps it's CH2-C( with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached with a methyl branch. Maybe it's CH2-C(CH2) something. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is isopropenyl. Because prop-1-en-2-yl is actually the same as isopropenyl. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, is it CH2-C(CH2) or CH2-C=CH2? Hmm, maybe I should move on for now.

So the first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, so it's often used for deprotonating something. In this case, the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) at position 3. Deprotonating that would give an alkoxide. Then, adding benzyl bromide, which is an alkylating agent. So the OH is being replaced by a benzyl group. So after the first step, product 1 would have a benzyl-O- group attached where the hydroxymethyl was. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl), which is CH2OH attached to position 3. So when you deprotonate CH2OH (the OH is acidic due to the adjacent carbonyl group), you get a CH2O^- which then attacks benzyl bromide (which is an SN2 reaction, I think). So the product would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl), but wait, the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl-O-CH2- group. So, product 1 would have a CH2-O-Bn (benzyl) group at position 3. So structure-wise, it's now 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone, and the hydroxymethyl is adjacent to the ketone. So when deprotonated, it becomes a good leaving group. So maybe the OH is replaced by benzyl, giving O
