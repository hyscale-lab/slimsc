Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question. Let me read it again. The question is about two chemists talking, and one says his compounds are "on top of each other." Hmm, what could that mean in a chemistry context?

I remember that when compounds are on top of each other, it might relate to how they're arranged in a mixture. Wait, like maybe they have similar properties so they don't separate easily. So the second chemist probably had a problem with the separation of his compounds.

I think about different techniques used in organic chemistry labs, like chromatography. If compounds are on top of each other, maybe they eluted together in a chromatography column because they have similar properties. Or perhaps it's about how they interact in a mixture, like during distillation. If their boiling points are close, they might not separate well when distilled.

Looking at the options, option C says similar boiling points. That seems plausible because if the boiling points are similar, they would vaporize around the same time, making separation difficult. But wait, what about other options?

Option A talks about similar polarities. Polar compounds would interact more in certain solvents, but how does that lead to being on top of each other? Maybe in chromatography, similar polarities mean they move together. So if they have similar polarities, they'd elute similarly, making them hard to separate as well.

Option B is about non-covalent interactions. If the compounds are bonding through van der Waals forces, maybe they form a solid or stick together. But I'm not sure how that would make them "on top." Maybe if they form a solid, they'd precipitate, but the question is about being on top.

Option D is about optical rotations. That's about chirality and how they rotate plane-polarized light. I don't think that relates to physical separation methods like chromatography or distillation.

So now I'm between A and C. The question is about why the compounds are on top of each other. If the compounds are being purified using, say, chromatography, then similar polarities would cause them to come out together. Alternatively, in distillation, similar boiling points would make them hard to separate.

Wait, but in the lab, when a chemist is isolating compounds, if they're using something like distillation, the compounds' boiling points determine when they collect as vapor. So if their boiling points are
