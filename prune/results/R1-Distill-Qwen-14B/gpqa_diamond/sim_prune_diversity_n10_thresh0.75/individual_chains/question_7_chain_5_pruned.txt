Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are a range of very high energies, so I think it's about high-energy gamma-rays interacting with the CMB.

Wait, I remember that when high-energy gamma-rays move through the universe, they can interact with the CMB photons. This interaction can cause them to annihilate into electron-positron pairs. The process is called pair production, I think it's gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. 

But why would their lifetime be limited by this process? Oh, right, because the gamma-rays can't just pass through; they lose energy by interacting. So if the interaction rate is high enough, the gamma-rays won't travel far before they annihilate, which limits how far they can travel (their lifetime in the universe, I guess).

I need to find the gamma energy where this annihilation process becomes significant. So, I should probably calculate the energy where the interaction rate equals a certain value. But wait, how do I approach this?

I think this has to do with the cross-section for the gamma-gamma interaction and the photon density of the CMB. The cross-section is the probability of the interaction happening. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me recall. The cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into electrons is given by a certain formula. I think it's proportional to the square of the photon energy. Wait, or is it more complicated than that? Oh, maybe the cross-section increases with the square of the center-of-mass energy, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the cross-section for e+ e- production from gamma-gamma collisions is approximately sigma ~ (Ïƒ_0) * (E_cm^2) / (m_e^2), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy and m_e is the electron mass. But maybe I'm mixing details here.

Alternatively, I remember that the threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the electron and positron. The threshold condition is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c^2. Since m_e is about 0.511 MeV, that's like
