Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each, then choose the correct combination from the options provided.

First, reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ might be added as a proton source later. So, what kind of reaction is this setup for?

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure given is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro has a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring (since 3.5 indicates the two ring sizes: 3 carbons in one and 5 in the other, but wait, no—spiro notation is the number of carbons in each ring. Wait, spiro[m.n] means the bridge is at position 1, and the two rings have m and n carbons respectively. So, [3.5]non would be a nine-carbon molecule: 3 + 5 + 1 (the bridge) = 9. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. I think the bridge is the single atom, so for spiro[m.n], m and n are the numbers of carbons in each ring. So, [3.5]non would be a nine-carbon molecule where the first ring has 3 and the second has 5, connected by a single carbon (the bridge).

The compound is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the bridge. The substituents would be a double bond in one ring and an alcohol group in position 1.

Now, what reaction conditions are present? THF is a solvent, and KH is a strong base. H+ is probably added as workup. So, maybe this is a deprotonation followed by a ring-opening or some kind of elimination?

Wait, but wait—KH is a strong base. It can deprotonate acidic hydrogens. The starting alcohol is an enol. Enols can be deprotonated by strong bases to form enolates. But 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol—so the alcohol is at the bridgehead, adjacent to the double bond. That's a conjugated enol, so the alpha protons are acidic. The base would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen, forming an enolate. But wait, the starting material has a double bond; maybe it's a conjugated diene?

Alternatively, another possibility is that the reaction is a pinacol-type coupling. Wait, no, pinacol is about 1,2-diols eliminating to form ketones. But here we have an enol, not a diol.

Wait, another thought: when a spiro compound with an enol is treated with a strong base like KH,
