Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, which gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are combinations for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone. The reaction with NaCN (which provides CN^-) probably forms a cyanohydrin. I think the general reaction is ketone + CN^- → cyanohydrin. So the first step is to make the cyanohydrin.

Wait, but what reagent helps in this addition? I recall that sometimes acid is used as a catalyst. For example, in the formation of cyanohydrins, H+ might protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So reagent A could be something acidic, like H3O+ (which is option A or B's A). But wait, another possibility is that the reaction is done without a catalyst, but more likely, a proton source is needed.

So, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ (which would be option A or B for A) would form the cyanohydrin. That makes sense.

Now, the second reaction is more interesting. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile substituted with a benzylphenyl group. So, I think the reaction is taking the nitrile group and turning it into a carboxylic acid. But how?

Wait, nitriles can be converted to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. One common method is hydrolysis. So, nitrile → acid. But the reaction conditions matter here. Depending on the reagents, the product could be a carboxylic acid or an amide or something else.
