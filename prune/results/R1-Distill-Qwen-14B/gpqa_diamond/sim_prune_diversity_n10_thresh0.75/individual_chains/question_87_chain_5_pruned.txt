Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Oh right, because di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. Each substituent is probably a group that adds a certain number of carbons.

The question mentions FTIR peaks showing a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents on the ring must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Hmm, wait, but wait—the FTIR has two peaks: one for carbonyl and another for aromatic-halogen. So, that suggests two substituents: one with a carbonyl and another with a halogen.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are two groups. Let's think: the total carbons in the molecule are 8. So 6 (ring) + 2 substituents' carbons = 8. So each substituent must contribute 1 carbon each. Because 6 + (x + y) = 8, so x + y =2. So each substituent is a group with one carbon.

So substituents are probably a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen (like Cl or Br). Wait, but halogen substituents like Cl or Br are single atoms, so they don't add any carbons. Oh wait, wait a second—wait, the substituent is a group with a carbon attached. So substituents might be things like a carbonyl group attached to the ring (like a ketone, but wait, that's O=C-R, but if R is a methyl, then that's two substituents?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-calculate. The compound has 8 carbons in total. It's a benzene ring (6 carbons) with two substituents. So the substituents together contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent must have one carbon each, or one substituent has two and the other has zero? No, because it's di-substituted,
