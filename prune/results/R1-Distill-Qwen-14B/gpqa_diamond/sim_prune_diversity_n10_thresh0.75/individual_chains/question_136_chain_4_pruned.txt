Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (∇ · f) inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. But wait, the question is directly asking for the volume integral, so maybe I should compute it directly.

Wait, but maybe using the divergence theorem would be easier. The divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇ · f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S enclosing V. So ∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫_S f · dA.

In this case, the volume V is a sphere of radius R. So the surface S is a sphere of radius R. Since the field f only has a radial component, and falls as 1/r², let's think about what f looks like at radius R.

Wait, the field f(r) is given as having a magnitude of 1/r², but it's a vector field. Since it's only radial, the vector field can be written as f(r) = (1/r²) r
