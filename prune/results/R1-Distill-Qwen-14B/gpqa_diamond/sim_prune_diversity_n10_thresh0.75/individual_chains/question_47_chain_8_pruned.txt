Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is 0 here. So C is 9, H is 11, N is 1, O is 2. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 → (20-11+1)/2 → 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 double bonds or rings) plus maybe an amide or ester group, which have their own rings or double bonds.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually N-H stretches, like in amines or amides. Maybe a secondary amide? Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an amide (around 1650-1700) or an ester (higher, around 1720-1750). Hmm, 1720 seems right for an ester or maybe a ketone, but since there's an O2, perhaps an ester or amide.

Now, the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a CH3 group attached to something like OCH2CH3. Because the triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so ethyl groups. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe NH protons. But wait, in NMR, amines or amides can be broad. If it's an amide, the NH would be around here, but sometimes they can be broad or even missing if it's a substituted amide. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group, but that's usually split differently, maybe as a quartet or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. For ethyl groups, the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet at around 4.1-4.3, but this is at 4.5. Alternatively, maybe an amide's CH2? Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest two sets of two protons each. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, you get two doublets each integrating to 2H, like two protons each on the two opposite positions. So the substituents are at para positions.

Putting this together: The structure has a benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is an ethyl group (like OCH2CH3) and another is a group that includes an amide or ester.

Wait, but let's think about the options.

The options are:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy at position 3. But the NMR shows para substitution, so this might be position 4. So probably not A.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a
