Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, I remember that the Higgs mechanism is involved here, and when you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, some particles become Goldstone bosons, but others get masses. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons are like the would-be Goldstone bosons that don't completely decouple because of some symmetry breaking pattern.

Looking at the Lagrangian given, let's parse it. The terms include i bar{N_R} gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which suggests these are right-handed neutrinos. Then there's (1/2)(partial^mu phi)^2, so phi is a scalar field with kinetic term. The D^mu S term squared is the covariant derivative acting on the scalar doublet S, which means S is in a non-trivial representation of the gauge group, probably an SU(2) doublet. The other terms are like y_i phi bar{N_iR}^c N_iR^c, which looks like Yukawa couplings for the neutrinos. The D term indicates that S is charged under the gauge symmetry.

The fields are given as N_iR ~ (1,1,0) – so singlet under SU(2) and SU(3), charge 0, probably right-handed neutrinos. S is a scalar doublet (1,2,1), so SU(2) doublet, hypercharge 1. Phi is a singlet scalar, (1,1,0), so neutral.

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) is given as <phi>^2 = x^2 + v^2, so <phi> = x and <h> = v. Wait, but phi is a singlet, so maybe h is another field? Or perhaps h is the Higgs field. Wait, the model seems to have multiple scalars: S, phi, and H which isn't explicitly mentioned here. Or perhaps H is another scalar, maybe the doublet S gets a VEV, leading to Higgs fields.

Wait, the potential V is given as V(phi, S, H), so H is another scalar. But the question is about H₂, the pseudo-Goldstone boson. So perhaps the setup is that the scalar fields phi and S (and perhaps H) get VEVs, leading to multiple Higgs bosons.

Wait, but the Lagrangian includes D^mu S, so S is in the SU(2) doublet. Let me think about the symmetry breaking. The Standard Model Higgs is a doublet that gets a VEV, breaking SU(2)×U(1) to U(1)em. Now, if there's another scalar phi that gets a VEV, perhaps it's part of a two Higgs doublet model or some extension.

Wait, phi is a singlet, so when it gets a VEV, it doesn't break the gauge symmetry. The VEV of phi is <phi>=x, but what about the other scalars? The scalar S is a doublet, so perhaps S gets a VEV too. Let me think: if S has a VEV, then it would break the SU(2) symmetry. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a doublet that gets a VEV. So perhaps in this model, both S and phi have VEVs. But wait, H is another scalar in the potential. Maybe H is another singlet or part of another multiplet.

Wait, the potential V is given as a function of phi, S, and H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that the scalar fields phi and S (and maybe H) are all getting VEVs. But the problem is about the mass of H₂, the pseudo-Goldstone boson. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a global symmetry is spontaneously broken, and if the symmetry isn't gauged, the Goldstone bosons (would-be) don't get eaten. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a SU(2) doublet, so when it gets a VEV, three of its components become the Goldstone bosons eaten by the W and Z bosons, and the fourth becomes the Higgs.

Wait, but in this model, perhaps there's more than one Higgs field. Alternatively, maybe the scalar fields are such that when they acquire VEVs, some of the Higgs bosons are pseudo-Goldstone.

Wait, the question says that the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ arises through radiative corrections. So I think the tree-level mass might be zero (since it's a Goldstone), but quantum corrections (like loops) give it a mass.

So, the mass would be calculated by considering loop corrections from various particles. The general formula for the mass squared would
