Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question asks which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite results that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make those infinities manageable, right? So when the question says a theory never requires regularization, that's implying that the theory doesn't have these divergences or doesn't need the technique to handle them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. From what I've heard, string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings moving through extra dimensions, and their interactions are calculated using different methods, like perturbative expansions but with better behavior. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences at high energies. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they still need some form of regularization for calculations? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does require renormalization, which is a type of regularization. Because of things like the running coupling and the way quarks interact, you get divergences. Plus, QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative methods feasible. But even so, calculations would still need regularization to deal with loop divergences. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has been very successful and that it definitely requires renormalization. The famous example is the calculation of the electron's magnetic moment. The theory has divergent loop diagrams, and without renormalization (which deals with these divergences), it wouldn't make sense. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? So classical theories don't deal with quantum divergences because they don't involve the same kind of calculations as quantum field theories. In classical E&M, you don't have issues like renormalization because there's no concept of particles as point charges with divergent charge densities. For example, in classical theory, you can have point charges, but when you quantize, those points lead to infinities that need fixing. So in classical electrodynamics, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. Classical E&M doesn't really have a notion of high energies affecting the theory's structure because it's not a quantum theory.
