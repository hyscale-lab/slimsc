However, nsp14-ExoN is a 3'-to-5' exonuclease that plays a role in proofreading during replication by removing incorrect bases. This activity does not \"prevent\" breakdown but instead facilitates the correction of mismatches by trimming incorrect RNA overhangs. Therefore, the statement is **incorrect** because it misrepresents the function of the ExoN domain.\n\n### Option B:\nORF3a is known to trigger caspase-8 activation, which is associated with the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The statement also notes that Bcl-2 levels are unaffected, suggesting that the intrinsic pathway (mitochondrial) is not involved. While ORF3a may primarily activate the extrinsic pathway, there is evidence that it can also influence the intrinsic pathway by affecting mitochondrial function. However, the statement does not explicitly claim exclusivity to the extrinsic pathway, making it plausible and **correct**.\n\n### Option C:\nThe statement explains that the rate of frameshifting is correlated with the number of pseudoknot conformations and that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit two conformations under tension. This aligns with known mechanisms of frameshifting in coronaviruses, where RNA structure influences translation. The statement is **correct**.\n\n### Option D:\nProgrammed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end of the genome, facilitated by slippery nucleotides and pseudoknots. The statement also claims that SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV. While there are slight differences in their genomes, their frameshifting mechanisms are largely similar, making this statement **correct**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe incorrect statement is **Option A**, as it inaccurately describes the role of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex in preventing dsRNA breakdown, whereas the complex actively removes incorrect RNA bases during proofreading.\n\nAnswer: A"
