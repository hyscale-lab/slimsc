Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw its structure in my mind. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). The carbonyl is at position 1 of the cyclohexane. Then, attached to the same carbon (the one with the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the name again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent on the aldehyde carbon is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, no. The aldehyde is at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to that same carbon. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group on one carbon, and that same carbon also has a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like:

The central carbon is attached to:
- An aldehyde group (CHO)
- A cyclohexane ring (the main ring)
- A CH2 group which is further attached to another cyclohexane ring and an OH group.

So, the substituent is CH2-C6H11-OH (but wait, cyclohexyl is C6H11, so the substituent is CH2-C6H11-OH?), but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that group is CH2OH and CH2-C6H11? No, maybe. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that's a methyl group (CH2-) which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl? No, wait. Wait, "hydroxy" is an -OH group attached to the methyl. So the group is CH2OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, that wouldn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxyl group and another by a cyclohexyl group. So it's CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)- attached to the aldehyde's carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to build this molecule. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached.

So ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-CH2 attached to the cyclohexane ring? Wait, no. Ethynyl is C≡CH, but attached to cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the correct structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So starting from that, we need to get to the target molecule.

So, the target molecule has an aldehyde group, so I think we'll need an oxidation step. Also, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, which suggests some kind of substitution or addition reactions.

Let me outline the steps for each option and see which makes sense.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of reagents. Let me go through each step of each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, step 3 is written twice as 3. Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's step 4. But regardless, the reagents are NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's a deprotonation and alkylation. Then H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Then Ba(OH)2, which is for elimination or perhaps for epoxide opening. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is the oxymercuration or some kind of hydration.

Wait, but let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a C≡CH group). Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So this is likely an alkylation via deprotonation of an acidic hydrogen and then alkylation. So perhaps the triple bond's terminal hydrogen is acidic. Deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide anion, then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So after step 1, we would have cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. If we deprotonate the terminal H (which is acidic because of the triple bond), we get a cyclohexenide with a -C≡CH minus a proton, so the anion is -C≡C^- . Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group, giving -C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexenyl? Wait, perhaps now the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So the -C≡C-CH3 would become -CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd is typically to convert it into a single bond. So an alkyne becomes an alkane. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, so the group becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The triple bond is between two carbons. If we hydrogenate it, each triple bond carbon gains two hydrogens. So the -C≡C-CH3 would become -CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent becomes a propyl group attached to cyclohexane?

Wait, but then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly, it's used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation or perhaps in the formation of epoxides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 in aqueous solution can cause elimination. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Hofmann elimination, but that involves amides.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogenation step. Let me think again. The initial compound after step 1 is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So hydrogenation would add two H's to each triple bond carbon. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, and each carbon gains two H's. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So it's a cyclohexane with a propyl group attached. So step 2 would give that.

Then step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm. Maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, Ba(OH)2 is more for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides, but I don't see an epoxide here. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to introduce an alcohol group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe that's for elimination of water to form an alkene. But how? We have a propyl group, which is -CH2-CH2-CH3. That doesn't have any leaving groups or adjacent H's for elimination. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Oh wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but I'm not sure about that step.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a typical acid-catalyzed hydration condition, like oxymercuration or maybe acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene. So maybe after step 3, there's an alkene formed, which then undergoes hydration.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check another option.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So deprotonation and alkylation with ethyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane would get an ethyl group via deprotonation. So after step 1, the substituent would be -C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, but ethyl chloride is CH3CH2Cl. When you deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, you get the anion at the terminal carbon. Adding ethyl chloride would alkylate it, giving -C≡C-CH2CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a propargyl ethyl group? Wait, no, more accurately, the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) becomes -C≡C-CH2CH3 after alkylation.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for deprotonation but also for elimination. Alternatively, it's used for coupling reactions, but more likely here, it's for elimination, forming an alkene. So perhaps the triple bond is converted to an alkene. Wait, but Li and NH3 is used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly, it's used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination. Alternatively, it's used for the formation of alkenes via elimination, like in the dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but in this case, we have an -C≡C-CH2CH3 group. Hmm, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is 1-ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added, making it 1-ethylpropargylcyclohexane? Not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonating and eliminating to form an alkene.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base, so step 1 might be a deprotonation to form the cyclohexenide, then alkylation with ethyl chloride to add an ethyl group to the triple bond. So after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2CH3 group (since ethyl chloride is CH2CH3 group).

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. What reaction occurs here? Well, Li is a strong reducing agent, but combined with NH3, it's typically used for Birch reductions (which reduce aromatic rings), but in this case, after alkylation, perhaps the triple bond undergoes some reaction. Another possibility is that the triple bond is reduced to a trans double bond. Wait, but that's more done with other reducing agents like Na/NH3 (sodamide). Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is a strong base that induces elimination.

Wait, if the molecule after step 1 has a terminal alkyne (like -C≡C-CH2CH3), perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, forming a triple bond again but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction. Wait, but Li in NH3 is usually a reducing agent for aromatic rings, but perhaps in this context, it's a way to reduce the triple bond to a trans-alkene. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So if step 2 forms a double bond, step 3 would cleave it, forming carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps to reduce any ozonides or to work up the ozonolysis reaction.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule. Let me think about the target. It's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, step 1: same as option A, alkylation with methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes single bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with a reagent like (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup, as opposed to oxidative which would use something like H2O or H2O2). Ozone cleaves double bonds, but in this case, after step 2, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds. So maybe this step isn't applicable, unless there's another double bond I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3 would not have a double bond to cleave. So this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the alkylation is with methanol? But I'm not sure. Wait, NaNH2 is used for deprotonation, and then methanol would act as the methylating agent. So ethynylcyclohexane would deprotonate, and then methyl group would be added from methanol, giving -C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, methanol is CH3OH, but when acting as an alkylating agent, it would typically transfer a methyl group, but I'm not sure about the conditions here. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Gilmann reaction, but that usually involves organometallic reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, leading to an -OCH3 group, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent, then hydrogenating the triple bond, then introducing an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexane.

Let me think about the steps needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So the plan is to functionalize this into the desired structure.

One possible pathway: 

1. Alkyne functionalization: perhaps add a methyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, which would be a methylene group. But wait, hydrogenation of a propargyl group (like -C≡C-CH3) would become -CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation. But that's a propyl group, which may not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to some dihydroxylation or epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. So an oxidation step is needed.

Another possibility: after hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, then oxidation of the alkene to an aldehyde. Hmm, but the aldehyde would come from an oxidation of an alkene.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation. Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps we need to form a ketone first and then reduce it or do something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, but I don't see how that would fit here.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then introducing an aldehyde group via oxidation.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in NH3; ozonolysis; then NH4OH.

If step 1 adds an ethyl group to the triple bond, making it -C≡C-CH2CH3, then step 2 could be deprotonation and elimination. Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, so perhaps it deprotonates the triple bond's adjacent carbon, leading to an elimination and forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it forms an alkene via elimination.

Wait, but with ethyl group attached, maybe elimination would form a double bond. So, after step 1, we have -C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 could be forming a double bond via elimination. But how? If the structure is -C≡C-CH2CH3, elimination would require removing a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon. But the ethynyl group is at the end; I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and then elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of each option's possible product.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a deprotonation and alkylation, but with methanol, perhaps it's a demethylation or something else. Not sure. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is likely a strong base for elimination. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, producing carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then forming a double bond, then cleaving it to form carbonyl groups, then reducing.

Wait, the target molecule has two rings attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps one of the rings comes from the starting material, and the other is introduced via some addition.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So the triple bond is attached to the cyclohexane. So after some steps, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a substituent that includes another cyclohexane ring.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So perhaps the steps involve installing a hydroxymethyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then some oxidation or addition occurs.

Wait, another thought: after hydrogenation, perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond, which is then epoxidized, then ring-opened to introduce an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but that would give a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think of the desired substituent. The substituent on the aldehyde is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So perhaps it's formed via a nucleophilic addition. Or perhaps via a Grignard reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe we can add a methyl group and then perform some hydrogenation and functionalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a propargyl alcohol, then adding another cyclohexane group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents and what each step could do.

Option C's steps: step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So alkylation, giving -C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond, so -CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group. Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone would cleave any double bonds. But after step 2, the molecule doesn't have a double bond. So this step seems odd. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group, which then undergoes ozonolysis. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this suggests that option C might not be correct.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O, which is a standard ozonolysis condition, typically oxidative. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a reductive workup, perhaps to avoid overoxidation. But if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, so perhaps in option B, after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Let me think: step 1 is alkylation with ethyl chloride, giving -C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Perhaps this induces elimination, converting the triple bond into a double bond.

Wait, but elimination usually requires a leaving group. Here, the structure is -C≡C-CH2CH3. How would Li in NH3 eliminate a molecule to form a double bond? It would need a hydrogen on a beta carbon. So, perhaps the Li abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2CH3 group, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the triple bond would become a double bond, and the adjacent CH2 group would lose a hydrogen, forming -C≡C-CH2CH2Li? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps elimination converts the triple bond into a trans double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's -CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond elsewhere. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a double bond via dehydrohalogenation, but without a halide, that's not possible. So this line of thinking is getting me stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reagents for each step and what transformations they induce.

In the target molecule, there's an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon. So perhaps the steps involve introducing both groups.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. Let's see: ethynylcyclohexane could be oxidized to a diketone, but that's not an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then further oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent. So perhaps the starting cyclohexane is functionalized to add both the aldehyde and the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then the substituent is added via some coupling reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then oxidizing to an aldehyde, and then introducing the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde.

But wait, how? The triple bond is at the end. So if I hydrogenate the triple bond, it becomes a single bond, making a propyl group. Then, perhaps oxidizing the end of the propyl group to an aldehyde.

But wait, propyl groups don't oxidize directly to aldehydes. They typically oxidize to ketones if possible, but in this case, the end is a CH3 group, which would oxidize to COOH, but not an aldehyde.

Wait, unless the oxidation is done in a way that stops at the aldehyde stage. For that, perhaps using a mild oxidizing agent under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a trans double bond, then the double bond is oxidized to a diepoxide, which then undergoes ring-opening to form diols, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reagents in each option again.

Option D: steps are NaNH2 and methanol; Li in NH3; ozonolysis; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But methanol is CH3OH. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with methanol to form an ether. But that would give a methoxy group attached to the alkyne. So the substituent would be -C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Li is a strong base; perhaps this induces elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps it reduces the triple bond to a trans double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a substitution, replacing the terminal hydrogen with a methyl group from methanol, giving -C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the substituent is -C≡C-CH3, then step 2's Li in NH3 could cause deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond. So the substituent would become -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbon, making it -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second? Or perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the possible reagents, the key transformations needed are:

1. Introduce a methyl group or ethyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

2. Convert the triple bond into something else, perhaps a single bond, or a double bond.

3. Introduce an aldehyde group.

4. Introduce a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group with a methyl group, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Oxidation of the terminal CH3 to a carboxylic acid, but that's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a partial oxidation to an aldehyde.

But I don't think propyl groups oxidize to aldehydes; more likely, they go to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Wait, another possibility: after hydrogenation of the triple bond, perhaps we have a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, we perform ozonolysis on a double bond that's formed in another step. Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a trans double bond, then ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is installed via a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Introduce a double bond via some elimination.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making progress quickly.

Wait, perhaps looking at the target, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So the hydroxymethyl group is connected to the same carbon as the cyclohexane. That suggests that perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to an aldehyde.

Wait, so the aldehyde would be formed from the starting material, perhaps via oxidation.

Wait, so maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to add a methyl group, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. The triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, oxidation of the terminal CH3 to a carboxylic acid, but that's not an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe instead, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to dihydroxylation, forming a vicinal diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let's see:

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so this step doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: adds an ethyl group, making -C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps elimination to form a double bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 with a double bond? Not sure.

3. O3/H2O: cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: perhaps reduction of ozonides.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So if the alkyne is first converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehyde groups, but that might not directly give the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which after alkylation becomes -C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, elimination forms a double bond, making -CH2-CH=CH2CH3. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, giving two aldehyde groups. But in this case, the molecule would have two aldehyde groups, which doesn't match the target.

Hmm.

Another approach: the correct answer is option C. Let me see why.

Option C:

After step 1: -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, this step is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps after step 2, there's another double bond formed elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Perhaps this alkylates the triple bond, giving -C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Could this be a Birch reduction, converting the cyclohexane ring into something else? Unlikely, because the target still has a cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 could reduce the triple bond into a trans double bond. So after step 2, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? Or perhaps a double bond is formed in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the substituent is -C≡C-OCH3. Then, Li in NH3 could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-OCH3, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just try to think of which option would produce the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexane ring, an aldehyde group, and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a propyl group.

3. Introduce a double bond, which is then cleaved via ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Introduce an epoxide via Ba(OH)2, which is then opened to form an alcohol.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think:

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation with methyl chloride → -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. So maybe this is a mistake, and the intended step is ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which would give aldehyde groups.

But without a double bond, this doesn't make sense. Unless there's a mistake in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another step that forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3's ozonolysis isn't applicable. So option C is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe step 3 in option C isn't ozonolysis. Wait, the reagents are O3 and (CH3)2S. That's a standard reductive workup after ozonolysis, which would break a double bond into carbonyl groups. But without a double bond, this can't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond in step 2. Wait, no, because step 2 uses H2/Pd, which would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that the starting alkyne must have been converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is via oxidation. But I'm not sure which reagent would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Oxidation to install an aldehyde group.

But I don't know which reagents do that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Assuming step 1 alkylates the triple bond with a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation, making -C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 installs a methoxy group, step 2 a double bond via elimination, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to conclude based on the options.

Wait, considering that the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon, perhaps the reagents involve adding a methyl group, then introducing an aldehyde via oxidation, and then installing the hydroxymethyl group via some addition.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → -C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination forms a double bond, making -CH2-CH=CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → perhaps to work up the ozonolysis, maybe forming aldehydes.

But the target has only one aldehyde group. So perhaps this would form two aldehyde groups, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material after step 1 is -C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 leads to a double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with option C as the correct answer. Wait, no, why? Because I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think:

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe installs a methyl group via alkylation, giving -C≡C-CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe reduces the triple bond to a trans double bond, giving -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbon (but that would be a trans double bond).

Wait, but Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, but I'm not certain.

3. Ozonolysis → if there's a double bond, it would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → maybe reduces any ozonides to aldehydes.

But in the target, there's only one aldehyde group. So perhaps the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups, but that doesn't fit the target.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps option D.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So the steps must involve:

- Adding a hydroxymethyl group.

How is that done? Perhaps via a Grignard reaction or some addition to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming an aldehyde, a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized or something else. But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the correct option is option C.

The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or epoxide formation, but no clear pathway to the target molecule is evident.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration conditions, but without a double bond, this step is unclear.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as it does not introduce the aldehyde or hydroxymethyl groups.

---

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with an ethyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond, but the mechanism is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup, but this sequence does not clearly produce the target molecule with a single aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

---

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive workup, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or epoxide formation, but no clear pathway to the target molecule is evident.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as it does not introduce the aldehyde or hydroxymethyl groups.

---

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond, but the mechanism is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive workup, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup, but this sequence does not clearly produce the target molecule with a single aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

---

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly produce the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite ambiguities in the steps.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me draw its structure in my mind. It looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). The carbonyl is at position 1 of the cyclohexane. Then, attached to the same carbon (the one with the aldehyde), there's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the name again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The substituent on the aldehyde carbon is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, no. The aldehyde is at position 1 of the cyclohexane ring. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to that same carbon. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group on one carbon, and that same carbon also has a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like:

The central carbon is attached to:
- An aldehyde group (CHO)
- A cyclohexane ring (the main ring)
- A CH2 group which is further attached to another cyclohexane ring and an OH group.

So, the substituent is CH2-C6H11-OH (but wait, cyclohexyl is C6H11, so the substituent is CH2-C6H11-OH?), but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So that group is CH2OH and CH2-C6H11? No, maybe. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that's a methyl group (CH2-) which is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl? No, wait. Wait, "hydroxy" is an -OH group attached to the methyl. So the group is CH2OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be CH2-OH and CH2-Cyclohexyl? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-Cyclohexyl-OH? No, that wouldn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group where one of the hydrogens is replaced by a hydroxyl group and another by a cyclohexyl group. So it's CH(OH)(Cyclohexyl)- attached to the aldehyde's carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to build this molecule. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached.

So ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-CH2 attached to the cyclohexane ring? Wait, no. Ethynyl is C≡CH, but attached to cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the correct structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So starting from that, we need to get to the target molecule.

So, the target molecule has an aldehyde group, so I think we'll need an oxidation step. Also, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, which suggests some kind of substitution or addition reactions.

Let me outline the steps for each option and see which makes sense.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of reagents. Let me go through each step of each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Wait, step 3 is written twice as 3. Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's step 4. But regardless, the reagents are NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That's a deprotonation and alkylation. Then H2 and Pd, which is hydrogenation. Then Ba(OH)2, which is for elimination or perhaps for epoxide opening. Then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O is the oxymercuration or some kind of hydration.

Wait, but let's think about the starting material: ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane with a C≡CH group). Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So this is likely an alkylation via deprotonation of an acidic hydrogen and then alkylation. So perhaps the triple bond's terminal hydrogen is acidic. Deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2 would give a cyclohexenide anion, then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So after step 1, we would have cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡CH attached to cyclohexane. If we deprotonate the terminal H (which is acidic because of the triple bond), we get a cyclohexenide with a -C≡CH minus a proton, so the anion is -C≡C^- . Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would add a methyl group, giving -C≡C-CH3. So the product after step 1 is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexenyl? Wait, perhaps now the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond. So the -C≡C-CH3 would become -CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd is typically to convert it into a single bond. So an alkyne becomes an alkane. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, so the group becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The triple bond is between two carbons. If we hydrogenate it, each triple bond carbon gains two hydrogens. So the -C≡C-CH3 would become -CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituent becomes a propyl group attached to cyclohexane?

Wait, but then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly, it's used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation or perhaps in the formation of epoxides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 in aqueous solution can cause elimination. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Hofmann elimination, but that involves amides.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogenation step. Let me think again. The initial compound after step 1 is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH3 group. So hydrogenation would add two H's to each triple bond carbon. So the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond, and each carbon gains two H's. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3. So it's a cyclohexane with a propyl group attached. So step 2 would give that.

Then step 3: Ba(OH)2. Hmm. Maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, Ba(OH)2 is more for elimination. Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides, but I don't see an epoxide here. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to introduce an alcohol group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe that's for elimination of water to form an alkene. But how? We have a propyl group, which is -CH2-CH2-CH3. That doesn't have any leaving groups or adjacent H's for elimination. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Oh wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but I'm not sure about that step.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's a typical acid-catalyzed hydration condition, like oxymercuration or maybe acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene. So maybe after step 3, there's an alkene formed, which then undergoes hydration.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check another option.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So deprotonation and alkylation with ethyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane would get an ethyl group via deprotonation. So after step 1, the substituent would be -C≡C-CH2CH3? Wait, but ethyl chloride is CH3CH2Cl. When you deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, you get the anion at the terminal carbon. Adding ethyl chloride would alkylate it, giving -C≡C-CH2CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a propargyl ethyl group? Wait, no, more accurately, the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) becomes -C≡C-CH2CH3 after alkylation.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for deprotonation but also for elimination. Alternatively, it's used for coupling reactions, but more likely here, it's for elimination, forming an alkene. So perhaps the triple bond is converted to an alkene. Wait, but Li and NH3 is used in the Birch reduction, but more commonly, it's used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination. Alternatively, it's used for the formation of alkenes via elimination, like in the dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but in this case, we have an -C≡C-CH2CH3 group. Hmm, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is 1-ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added, making it 1-ethylpropargylcyclohexane? Not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonating and eliminating to form an alkene.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base, so step 1 might be a deprotonation to form the cyclohexenide, then alkylation with ethyl chloride to add an ethyl group to the triple bond. So after step 1, the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2CH3 group (since ethyl chloride is CH2CH3 group).

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. What reaction occurs here? Well, Li is a strong reducing agent, but combined with NH3, it's typically used for Birch reductions (which reduce aromatic rings), but in this case, after alkylation, perhaps the triple bond undergoes some reaction. Another possibility is that the triple bond is reduced to a trans double bond. Wait, but that's more done with other reducing agents like Na/NH3 (sodamide). Alternatively, perhaps Li in NH3 is a strong base that induces elimination.

Wait, if the molecule after step 1 has a terminal alkyne (like -C≡C-CH2CH3), perhaps step 2 is a deprotonation and elimination, forming a triple bond again but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could lead to the formation of an alkene via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction. Wait, but Li in NH3 is usually a reducing agent for aromatic rings, but perhaps in this context, it's a way to reduce the triple bond to a trans-alkene. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Step 3: O3 followed by H2O. That's ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So if step 2 forms a double bond, step 3 would cleave it, forming carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps to reduce any ozonides or to work up the ozonolysis reaction.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target molecule. Let me think about the target. It's a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Wait, step 1: same as option A, alkylation with methyl chloride. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. That's hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes single bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with a reagent like (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup, as opposed to oxidative which would use something like H2O or H2O2). Ozone cleaves double bonds, but in this case, after step 2, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds. So maybe this step isn't applicable, unless there's another double bond I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3 would not have a double bond to cleave. So this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ (CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm, methanol is a methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the alkylation is with methanol? But I'm not sure. Wait, NaNH2 is used for deprotonation, and then methanol would act as the methylating agent. So ethynylcyclohexane would deprotonate, and then methyl group would be added from methanol, giving -C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, methanol is CH3OH, but when acting as an alkylating agent, it would typically transfer a methyl group, but I'm not sure about the conditions here. Alternatively, perhaps this is a Gilmann reaction, but that usually involves organometallic reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a deprotonation and alkylation with methanol, leading to an -OCH3 group, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent, then hydrogenating the triple bond, then introducing an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexane.

Let me think about the steps needed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So the plan is to functionalize this into the desired structure.

One possible pathway: 

1. Alkyne functionalization: perhaps add a methyl group to the triple bond, then hydrogenate it to a single bond, which would be a methylene group. But wait, hydrogenation of a propargyl group (like -C≡C-CH3) would become -CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation. But that's a propyl group, which may not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to some dihydroxylation or epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, the target molecule has an aldehyde group. So an oxidation step is needed.

Another possibility: after hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, then oxidation of the alkene to an aldehyde. Hmm, but the aldehyde would come from an oxidation of an alkene.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation. Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps we need to form a ketone first and then reduce it or do something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, but I don't see how that would fit here.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then introducing an aldehyde group via oxidation.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li in NH3; ozonolysis; then NH4OH.

If step 1 adds an ethyl group to the triple bond, making it -C≡C-CH2CH3, then step 2 could be deprotonation and elimination. Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, so perhaps it deprotonates the triple bond's adjacent carbon, leading to an elimination and forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it forms an alkene via elimination.

Wait, but with ethyl group attached, maybe elimination would form a double bond. So, after step 1, we have -C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, step 2 could be forming a double bond via elimination. But how? If the structure is -C≡C-CH2CH3, elimination would require removing a hydrogen from a neighboring carbon. But the ethynyl group is at the end; I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and then elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of each option's possible product.

Option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe that's a deprotonation and alkylation, but with methanol, perhaps it's a demethylation or something else. Not sure. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is likely a strong base for elimination. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds, producing carbonyl groups. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then forming a double bond, then cleaving it to form carbonyl groups, then reducing.

Wait, the target molecule has two rings attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde. So perhaps one of the rings comes from the starting material, and the other is introduced via some addition.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So the triple bond is attached to the cyclohexane. So after some steps, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a substituent that includes another cyclohexane ring.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule's substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So that would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So perhaps the steps involve installing a hydroxymethyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then some oxidation or addition occurs.

Wait, another thought: after hydrogenation, perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond, which is then epoxidized, then ring-opened to introduce an OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but that would give a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, so perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an enol ether, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: let's think of the desired substituent. The substituent on the aldehyde is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So perhaps it's formed via a nucleophilic addition. Or perhaps via a Grignard reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Maybe we can add a methyl group and then perform some hydrogenation and functionalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a propargyl alcohol, then adding another cyclohexane group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reagents and what each step could do.

Option C's steps: step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So alkylation, giving -C≡C-CH3. Step 2: H2 with Pd and CaCO3. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to single bond, so -CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group. Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone would cleave any double bonds. But after step 2, the molecule doesn't have a double bond. So this step seems odd. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group, which then undergoes ozonolysis. But without a double bond, ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this suggests that option C might not be correct.

Option B: step 3 is O3/H2O, which is a standard ozonolysis condition, typically oxidative. Then step 4 is NH4OH, which is a reductive workup, perhaps to avoid overoxidation. But if the molecule has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, so perhaps in option B, after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Let me think: step 1 is alkylation with ethyl chloride, giving -C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Perhaps this induces elimination, converting the triple bond into a double bond.

Wait, but elimination usually requires a leaving group. Here, the structure is -C≡C-CH2CH3. How would Li in NH3 eliminate a molecule to form a double bond? It would need a hydrogen on a beta carbon. So, perhaps the Li abstracts a hydrogen from the CH2CH3 group, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the triple bond would become a double bond, and the adjacent CH2 group would lose a hydrogen, forming -C≡C-CH2CH2Li? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps elimination converts the triple bond into a trans double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the triple bond becomes a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's -CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond elsewhere. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a double bond via dehydrohalogenation, but without a halide, that's not possible. So this line of thinking is getting me stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reagents for each step and what transformations they induce.

In the target molecule, there's an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon. So perhaps the steps involve introducing both groups.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via some oxidation. Let's see: ethynylcyclohexane could be oxidized to a diketone, but that's not an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol, then further oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a substituent. So perhaps the starting cyclohexane is functionalized to add both the aldehyde and the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, and then the substituent is added via some coupling reaction. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then oxidizing to an aldehyde, and then introducing the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde.

But wait, how? The triple bond is at the end. So if I hydrogenate the triple bond, it becomes a single bond, making a propyl group. Then, perhaps oxidizing the end of the propyl group to an aldehyde.

But wait, propyl groups don't oxidize directly to aldehydes. They typically oxidize to ketones if possible, but in this case, the end is a CH3 group, which would oxidize to COOH, but not an aldehyde.

Wait, unless the oxidation is done in a way that stops at the aldehyde stage. For that, perhaps using a mild oxidizing agent under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a trans double bond, then the double bond is oxidized to a diepoxide, which then undergoes ring-opening to form diols, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reagents in each option again.

Option D: steps are NaNH2 and methanol; Li in NH3; ozonolysis; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation followed by alkylation. But methanol is CH3OH. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then reacts with methanol to form an ether. But that would give a methoxy group attached to the alkyne. So the substituent would be -C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Li is a strong base; perhaps this induces elimination, forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps it reduces the triple bond to a trans double bond. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a substitution, replacing the terminal hydrogen with a methyl group from methanol, giving -C≡C-CH3. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the triple bond, leading to an elimination and forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the substituent is -C≡C-CH3, then step 2's Li in NH3 could cause deprotonation and elimination, forming a double bond. So the substituent would become -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbon, making it -CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between the first and second? Or perhaps the triple bond becomes a trans double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the possible reagents, the key transformations needed are:

1. Introduce a methyl group or ethyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

2. Convert the triple bond into something else, perhaps a single bond, or a double bond.

3. Introduce an aldehyde group.

4. Introduce a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group with a methyl group, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Oxidation of the terminal CH3 to a carboxylic acid, but that's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a partial oxidation to an aldehyde.

But I don't think propyl groups oxidize to aldehydes; more likely, they go to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Wait, another possibility: after hydrogenation of the triple bond, perhaps we have a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, we perform ozonolysis on a double bond that's formed in another step. Wait, but without a double bond, ozonolysis won't do anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a trans double bond, then ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target structure.

Wait, perhaps the target's substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to an aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is installed via a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Introduce a double bond via some elimination.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making progress quickly.

Wait, perhaps looking at the target, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So the hydroxymethyl group is connected to the same carbon as the cyclohexane. That suggests that perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to an aldehyde.

Wait, so the aldehyde would be formed from the starting material, perhaps via oxidation.

Wait, so maybe the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is alkylated to add a methyl group, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. The triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, oxidation of the terminal CH3 to a carboxylic acid, but that's not an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe instead, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then subjected to dihydroxylation, forming a vicinal diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let's see:

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making -C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-CaCO3: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so this step doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: adds an ethyl group, making -C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps elimination to form a double bond, making -CH2-CH2-CH2CH2 with a double bond? Not sure.

3. O3/H2O: cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: perhaps reduction of ozonides.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So if the alkyne is first converted into a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehyde groups, but that might not directly give the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which after alkylation becomes -C≡C-CH2CH3. Then, elimination forms a double bond, making -CH2-CH=CH2CH3. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, giving two aldehyde groups. But in this case, the molecule would have two aldehyde groups, which doesn't match the target.

Hmm.

Another approach: the correct answer is option C. Let me see why.

Option C:

After step 1: -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-CaCO3 → -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. But without a double bond, this step is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps after step 2, there's another double bond formed elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Perhaps this alkylates the triple bond, giving -C≡C-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in NH3. Could this be a Birch reduction, converting the cyclohexane ring into something else? Unlikely, because the target still has a cyclohexane ring.

Alternatively, Li in NH3 could reduce the triple bond into a trans double bond. So after step 2, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? Or perhaps a double bond is formed in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the substituent is -C≡C-OCH3. Then, Li in NH3 could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes -CH2-C≡C-OCH3, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just try to think of which option would produce the target structure.

The target has a cyclohexane ring, an aldehyde group, and a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl cyclohexyl group. So perhaps the steps involve:

1. Alkylation of the ethynyl group to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to make a propyl group.

3. Introduce a double bond, which is then cleaved via ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Introduce an epoxide via Ba(OH)2, which is then opened to form an alcohol.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think:

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation with methyl chloride → -C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → -CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. So maybe this is a mistake, and the intended step is ozonolysis followed by reductive workup, which would give aldehyde groups.

But without a double bond, this doesn't make sense. Unless there's a mistake in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another step that forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a propyl group. Then, step 3's ozonolysis isn't applicable. So option C is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe step 3 in option C isn't ozonolysis. Wait, the reagents are O3 and (CH3)2S. That's a standard reductive workup after ozonolysis, which would break a double bond into carbonyl groups. But without a double bond, this can't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond in step 2. Wait, no, because step 2 uses H2/Pd, which would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which suggests that the starting alkyne must have been converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is via oxidation. But I'm not sure which reagent would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Oxidation to install an aldehyde group.

But I don't know which reagents do that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Assuming step 1 alkylates the triple bond with a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation, making -C≡C-OCH3? Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 installs a methoxy group, step 2 a double bond via elimination, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to conclude based on the options.

Wait, considering that the target molecule has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon, perhaps the reagents involve adding a methyl group, then introducing an aldehyde via oxidation, and then installing the hydroxymethyl group via some addition.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

1. Alkylation with ethyl chloride → -C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → perhaps elimination forms a double bond, making -CH2-CH=CH2CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → perhaps to work up the ozonolysis, maybe forming aldehydes.

But the target has only one aldehyde group. So perhaps this would form two aldehyde groups, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material after step 1 is -C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2 leads to a double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with option C as the correct answer. Wait, no, why? Because I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think:

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe installs a methyl group via alkylation, giving -C≡C-CH3.

2. Li in NH3 → maybe reduces the triple bond to a trans double bond, giving -CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between the first and second carbon (but that would be a trans double bond).

Wait, but Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination, but I'm not certain.

3. Ozonolysis → if there's a double bond, it would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → maybe reduces any ozonides to aldehydes.

But in the target, there's only one aldehyde group. So perhaps the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups, but that doesn't fit the target.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps option D.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So the steps must involve:

- Adding a hydroxymethyl group.

How is that done? Perhaps via a Grignard reaction or some addition to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming an aldehyde, a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized or something else. But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the correct option is option C.


The problem involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group at position 1 and a substituent that is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane ring. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or epoxide formation, but no clear pathway to the target molecule is evident.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration conditions, but without a double bond, this step is unclear.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as it does not introduce the aldehyde or hydroxymethyl groups.

---

#### **Option B:**
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with an ethyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond, but the mechanism is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl groups.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup, but this sequence does not clearly produce the target molecule with a single aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

---

#### **Option C:**
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming -CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive workup, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: Likely used for elimination or epoxide formation, but no clear pathway to the target molecule is evident.

This sequence does not align with the target structure, as it does not introduce the aldehyde or hydroxymethyl groups.

---

#### **Option D:**
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the terminal hydrogen of the ethynyl group and alkylates it with a methyl group, resulting in -C≡C-CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination to form a double bond, but the mechanism is unclear.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis with reductive workup, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: Reductive workup, but this sequence does not clearly produce the target molecule with a single aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group.

This sequence does not lead to the desired product.

---

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly produce the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible, despite ambiguities in the steps.

**Answer: C**
