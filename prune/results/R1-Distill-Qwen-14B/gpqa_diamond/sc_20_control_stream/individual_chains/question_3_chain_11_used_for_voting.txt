Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz (the Pauli z-matrix). The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So, for an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can think of this as a sum of two operators. Maybe I can compute the expectation of each part separately and then add them up.

Let me break it down. The expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ is equal to 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

Wait, what's the given state? It's 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me note the coefficients. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, and for |↓⟩ it's sqrt(3)/2.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is straightforward. Because σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute those squares.

0.5 squared is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/4, which is 0.75. So:

⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation for σz is -0.5. Then, 10 times that is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Unlike σz, it's more complicated because its eigenstates are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write the state ψ in vector form. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1], then ψ is:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So in vector form, that would be the first component 0.5, second component sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To compute ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ψ† σx ψ.

But wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by the conjugate, but since the coefficients are real, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

So let's compute it step by step.

First, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], I get:

σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, I take the inner product of ⟨ψ| with this vector.

⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Calculating each term:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330,

and sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 is the same, so 0.4330 again.

Adding them together: 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866.

Wait, actually, wait a minute. Let me make sure I did this correctly. Because I've sometimes messed up matrix multiplications before.

Alternatively, another method: for spin-1/2 systems, the expectation value of σx can be found using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = 2 (probability up - probability down), but wait, is that correct?

Wait, σx is the Pauli x operator, which, in terms of spin, can be thought of as measuring the spin in the x-direction. The expectation value is (⟨+x|ψ⟩)^2 - (⟨-x|ψ⟩)^2 multiplied by 2 or something like that. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but its eigenstates are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and |−x⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps the method I did earlier is correct. Let me double-check the calculation.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Then σx ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Which is 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait, that's the same as before. So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but why is that so? Because in the state, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So, perhaps the expectation value of σx is (2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )) = sqrt(3)/2. But perhaps I made a miscalculation, let me see.

Alternatively, another formula: for a spin-1/2 system in state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩,

⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(a b*), where Re is real part.

Wait, so a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. Then a b* is (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b*) is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Yes, that matches the earlier calculation. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ is:

10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) → (-5) + (5 * 0.8660).

Wait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (5 * 1.732)/2 → 8.66/2=4.33? Wait, no: sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 times that is 4.33.

So 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives +4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(3)/2: exact value is approximately 0.8660254.

So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 0.8660254) ≈ 4.330127.

So 10σz gives: 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Adding to that 5σx's contribution: +4.330127.

Total expectation value: -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

So approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4 → no.

B) 1.65 → no.

C) -0.7 → that's close.

D) 0.85 → no.

Wait, wait, but what's the precise calculation?

Wait, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2.

So the exact expectation value is:

-5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Let me compute this exactly.

5*sqrt(3) ≈5*1.7320508075688772 ≈8.660254037844386.

Divide by 2: about 4.330127018922193.

So 4.330127 minus 5 is indeed -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7.

So the expectation value is about -0.7, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expectation value of σx. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

Since σx is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is real.

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to express it as:

⟨σx⟩ = (ψ† σx ψ).

In terms of components, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the product ψ† σx ψ is:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [ [0,1],[1,0] ] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Let me compute σx * ψ first.

σx * ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ψ† times that vector:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, so that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding to 10 * (-0.5) → -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C, -0.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is given by:
\[
\sigma_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( \psi \) in vector form is:
\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
0.5
\end{bmatrix}
=
0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) + 5 \cdot 0.866.
\]

Calculating:
\[
10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5, \quad 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to one decimal place
The expectation value rounds to \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C) -0.7**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz (the Pauli z-matrix). The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So, for an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where ψ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can think of this as a sum of two operators. Maybe I can compute the expectation of each part separately and then add them up.

Let me break it down. The expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ is equal to 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I just need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

Wait, what's the given state? It's 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me note the coefficients. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, and for |↓⟩ it's sqrt(3)/2.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is straightforward. Because σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Let me compute those squares.

0.5 squared is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/4, which is 0.75. So:

⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation for σz is -0.5. Then, 10 times that is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Unlike σz, it's more complicated because its eigenstates are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me write the state ψ in vector form. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1], then ψ is:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So in vector form, that would be the first component 0.5, second component sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To compute ⟨σx⟩, I need to compute ψ† σx ψ.

But wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by the conjugate, but since the coefficients are real, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

So let's compute it step by step.

First, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I apply σx to |ψ⟩, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], I get:

σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, I take the inner product of ⟨ψ| with this vector.

⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So the inner product is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Calculating each term:

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.4330,

and sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 is the same, so 0.4330 again.

Adding them together: 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ ≈ 0.866.

Wait, actually, wait a minute. Let me make sure I did this correctly. Because I've sometimes messed up matrix multiplications before.

Alternatively, another method: for spin-1/2 systems, the expectation value of σx can be found using the formula ⟨σx⟩ = 2 (probability up - probability down), but wait, is that correct?

Wait, σx is the Pauli x operator, which, in terms of spin, can be thought of as measuring the spin in the x-direction. The expectation value is (⟨+x|ψ⟩)^2 - (⟨-x|ψ⟩)^2 multiplied by 2 or something like that. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but its eigenstates are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and |−x⟩ = (|↑⟩ − |↓⟩)/sqrt(2).

But perhaps the method I did earlier is correct. Let me double-check the calculation.

ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Then σx ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Which is 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, wait, that's the same as before. So yes, ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but why is that so? Because in the state, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. So, perhaps the expectation value of σx is (2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )) = sqrt(3)/2. But perhaps I made a miscalculation, let me see.

Alternatively, another formula: for a spin-1/2 system in state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩,

⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(a b*), where Re is real part.

Wait, so a is 0.5, b is sqrt(3)/2. Then a b* is (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b*) is 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Yes, that matches the earlier calculation. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ is:

10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) → (-5) + (5 * 0.8660).

Wait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (5 * 1.732)/2 → 8.66/2=4.33? Wait, no: sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 times that is 4.33.

So 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives +4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute sqrt(3)/2: exact value is approximately 0.8660254.

So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 0.8660254) ≈ 4.330127.

So 10σz gives: 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Adding to that 5σx's contribution: +4.330127.

Total expectation value: -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873.

So approximately -0.67.

Looking at the options:

A) -1.4 → no.

B) 1.65 → no.

C) -0.7 → that's close.

D) 0.85 → no.

Wait, wait, but what's the precise calculation?

Wait, 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*sqrt(3))/2.

So the exact expectation value is:

-5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Let me compute this exactly.

5*sqrt(3) ≈5*1.7320508075688772 ≈8.660254037844386.

Divide by 2: about 4.330127018922193.

So 4.330127 minus 5 is indeed -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7.

So the expectation value is about -0.7, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expectation value of σx. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expectation value more carefully.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

Since σx is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value is real.

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to express it as:

⟨σx⟩ = (ψ† σx ψ).

In terms of components, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], and ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So the product ψ† σx ψ is:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [ [0,1],[1,0] ] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Let me compute σx * ψ first.

σx * ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ψ† times that vector:

0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, so that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 ≈4.33.

Adding to 10 * (-0.5) → -5 +4.33 = -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

So the correct answer is option C, -0.7.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is given by:
\[
\sigma_x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( \psi \) in vector form is:
\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
0.5
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
0.5
\end{bmatrix}
=
0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) + 5 \cdot 0.866.
\]

Calculating:
\[
10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5, \quad 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to one decimal place
The expectation value rounds to \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C) -0.7**.

Answer: C
