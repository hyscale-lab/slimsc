Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about transits and the factors that affect their probability.

Transit probability depends on a few main things. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with our line of sight. But since we can't know that in advance, the probability is a statistical measure based on the system's parameters.

Wait, I think the main factors are the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_p / a)^2, but wait, isn't it more precise? Let me think. I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (r_s / a)^2, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, another approach. The probability of a transit is approximately the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, right? Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is roughly (R_* / a), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula.

Wait, I think the exact formula is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. But wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The probability depends on the area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the area the planet can block. Oh, right! The probability is ( (R_* + R_p) ) / (a) ) squared? No, wait. I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_*/a) * (some factor based on inclination). But wait, that's not exactly right. I remember reading that the geometric probability for a transit is (R_*/a), assuming that the orbit is randomly oriented. So higher a (larger orbit) leads to a lower probability because the planet has a smaller chance of crossing our line of sight.

Wait, let me think: the formula for the probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (something else?), but I think for circular orbits, the probability is roughly (R_*/a). Because the planet's path is a circle, and the chance it blocks our view is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

But wait, no, another thought. The probability depends on the ratio of the orbital distance to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius. Hmm... No, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star's radius, so R_* + R_p ≈ R_*. So the probability is roughly (R_*/a) * (something else?), or maybe (R_*/a) squared? No, it's the area of the star relative to the area of the planet's orbit... Wait, no. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit, but since the planet's orbit is a circle, the area is πa². The area of the star is πR_*². Wait, so the probability would be (R_*²) / (a²) )? That doesn't seem right because if a is larger, the probability would be much lower. Wait, but I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by the probability of the planet's orbit being aligned such that it transits. The geometric probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (something else?), but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula or think about it differently.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability can be approximated by the formula:

P ≈ (R_* + R_p) / a

But since R_p << R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_* / a). So if another planet has a higher R_* or a lower a, then the probability is higher.

In this problem, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Let's note the given data.

Given:

- Both planets have the same mass.

- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

- Host stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

Wait, but the RV method detects planets based on the Doppler shift. The minimum mass is determined, but for the transit probability, we don't care about the mass of the planet, only the size. Since the planets have the same mass, but without knowing their radii, but perhaps we can assume that Earth-like planets have similar densities? Or, wait, the question says "Earth-like planets," so perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's. But maybe their radii are the same. The question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume R_p1 = R_p2, as they're Earth-like.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require the planet radius because it's the same for both. So when calculating the ratio, the planet radii would cancel.

So focusing on the transit probability, which is proportional to (R_* / a) for each planet. The higher this ratio, the higher the probability.

So for each planet, calculate (R_* / a). Then take the ratio of the two to find which has a higher probability.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit, but since we can't know that, we take the probability as a statistical measure, which is the geometric probability. So for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R_* / a). Or perhaps it's (2 R_* / a), but I think it's R_* / a multiplied by some factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the geometric probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but as R_p is much smaller than R_*, we approximate it as R_* / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_* / a).

So for each planet, compute R_* / a.

But wait, what's a? a is the orbital distance. We don't have a given directly, but we have the orbital period. So using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (a) and the mass of the star.

Kepler's third law is: (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_* + M_p) / (4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So a^3 = (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_* P²)^(1/3).

So a = [ (G M_* P^2) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since we're comparing two planets, and we can assume that the constants (G, 4π²) are the same for both, a is proportional to (M_* * P^2)^(1/3).

So for each planet, calculate a.

Let me denote:

For Planet_1: M_1 is the mass of the host star. Given that M_1 = 2 * M_2, since the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states: "the star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2." So M1 = 2 * M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So for a1, the semi-major axis of Planet_1:

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * ( (P2/3) )^2 )^(1/3) = ( 2 M2 * P2²/(9) )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2^2)^(1/3)

a2 for Planet_2 is:

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2^2)^(1/3)

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2

Wait, because a2 is proportional to (M2 P2²)^(1/3), so (M2 P2²)^(1/3) is a2's coefficient.

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2. Let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is shorter than a2 by a factor of about 0.6.

Now, compute R_* / a for each planet.

For Planet_1: R_1 / a1

For Planet_2: R_2 / a2

But the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_1 = R_2 = R. So R_* is the same for both.

So:

P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2

But from earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So P1 = R / (0.6 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.6) * (R / a2) = (5/3) * (R / a2)

Wait, but R / a2 is P2. So P1 = (5/3) P2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a1 is less than a2, then R/a1 is larger than R/a2, so P1 (Planet_1's probability) is higher.

Wait, wait, P1 is R/a1, and P2 is R/a2.

Since a1 is approximately 0.6 a2, then a1 < a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 > P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating a1 and a2:

a1 ∝ (M1 P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 * M2 * P2^2 /9 )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 P2²)^(1/3 )

So a1 = [2/(9)]^(1/3) * a2.

[2/9] = 0.222. Cube root is approximately 0.6.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = 1.666... * (R/a2) = approx 1.67 times higher than (R/a2).

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.67 times higher than Planet_2.

But wait, the options are:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x higher probability.

Option D: 2.7x.

So 1.67 is close to option C.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I approximated the cube root.

Let me compute [2/9]^(1/3) more accurately.

Compute 2/9 = 0.2222...

Compute x^3 = 0.2222.

What's 0.6 cubed? 0.216. 0.62^3=0.238. So 0.62^3=0.238, which is larger than 0.222.

So 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.62^3=0.238.

0.222 is between 0.6 and 0.62. Let's interpolate.

Let's say f(x) = x³.

We have f(0.6) = 0.216, f(0.615) = ?

0.615^3 = let's compute:

0.6^3 = 0.216.

0.015^3 is negligible, but cross terms:

(0.6 + 0.015)^3 = 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2*(0.015) + 3*(0.6)*(0.015)^2 + (0.015)^3.

= 0.216 + 3*(0.36)(0.015) + 3*(0.6)(0.000225) + 0.000003375

= 0.216 + 0.0162 + 0.000405 + 0.000003375

≈ 0.216 + 0.0162 = 0.2322 + 0.000405 = 0.2326 + 0.000003375 ≈ 0.2326.

Wait, that's for 0.615^3. But 0.222 is less than that, so maybe I should go lower.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me think.

We can compute [2/9]^(1/3) as (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3)/9^(1/3).

2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26.

9^(1/3) is approximately 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So [2/9]^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a1 = 0.605 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.605 a2) = (1/0.605) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.652 * (R/a2).

So approximately 1.65 times higher.

So Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer would be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the comparison depends on the orbital distance \( a \). 

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left(M_* P^2\right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

1. **Planet_1**: The host star's mass is \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), and the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_1 \propto \left(2M_{*,2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}M_{*,2}P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
   \]

2. **Planet_2**: The semi-major axis is:
   \[
   a_2 \propto \left(M_{*,2}P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
   \]

Taking the ratio of the two semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2}{9}M_{*,2}P_2^2}{M_{*,2}P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \), we find:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \). Substituting this into the transit probability formula:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option C** states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit, which matches the calculation.

But since R_p << R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_* / a). So if another planet has a higher R_* or a lower a, then the probability is higher.

In this problem, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Let's note the given data.

Given:

- Both planets have the same mass.

- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

- Host stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

Wait, but the RV method detects planets based on the Doppler shift. The minimum mass is determined, but for the transit probability, we don't care about the mass of the planet, only the size. Since the planets have the same mass, but without knowing their radii, but perhaps we can assume that Earth-like planets have similar densities? Or, wait, the question says "Earth-like planets," so perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's. But maybe their radii are the same. The question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume R_p1 = R_p2, as they're Earth-like.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require the planet radius because it's the same for both. So when calculating the ratio, the planet radii would cancel.

So focusing on the transit probability, which is proportional to (R_* / a) for each planet. The higher this ratio, the higher the probability.

So for each planet, calculate (R_* / a). Then take the ratio of the two to find which has a higher probability.

But wait, I'm not sure. Another thought: the probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit, but since we can't know that, we take the probability as a statistical measure, which is the geometric probability. So for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is (R_* / a). Or perhaps it's (2 R_* / a), but I think it's R_* / a multiplied by some factor.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the geometric probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but as R_p is much smaller than R_*, we approximate it as R_* / a. So the probability is proportional to (R_* / a).

So for each planet, compute R_* / a.

But wait, what's a? a is the orbital distance. We don't have a given directly, but we have the orbital period. So using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (a) and the mass of the star.

Kepler's third law is: (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_* + M_p) / (4π²). Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So a^3 = (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_* P²)^(1/3).

So a = [ (G M_* P^2) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

But since we're comparing two planets, and we can assume that the constants (G, 4π²) are the same for both, a is proportional to (M_* * P^2)^(1/3).

So for each planet, calculate a.

Let me denote:

For Planet_1: M_1 is the mass of the host star. Given that M_1 = 2 * M_2, since the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states: "the star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2." So M1 = 2 * M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So for a1, the semi-major axis of Planet_1:

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * ( (P2/3) )^2 )^(1/3) = ( 2 M2 * P2²/(9) )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2^2)^(1/3)

a2 for Planet_2 is:

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2^2)^(1/3)

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2

Wait, because a2 is proportional to (M2 P2²)^(1/3), so (M2 P2²)^(1/3) is a2's coefficient.

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2. Let me calculate (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is shorter than a2 by a factor of about 0.6.

Now, compute R_* / a for each planet.

For Planet_1: R_1 / a1

For Planet_2: R_2 / a2

But the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_1 = R_2 = R. So R_* is the same for both.

So:

P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2

But from earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So P1 = R / (0.6 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.6) * (R / a2) = (5/3) * (R / a2)

Wait, but R / a2 is P2. So P1 = (5/3) P2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a1 is less than a2, then R/a1 is larger than R/a2, so P1 (Planet_1's probability) is higher.

Wait, wait, P1 is R/a1, and P2 is R/a2.

Since a1 is approximately 0.6 a2, then a1 < a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1 > P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating a1 and a2:

a1 ∝ (M1 P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 * M2 * P2^2 /9 )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 P2²)^(1/3 )

So a1 = [2/(9)]^(1/3) * a2.

[2/9] = 0.222. Cube root is approximately 0.6.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) = 1.666... * (R/a2) = approx 1.67 times higher than (R/a2).

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.67 times higher than Planet_2.

But wait, the options are:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x higher probability.

Option D: 2.7x.

So 1.67 is close to option C.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I approximated the cube root.

Let me compute [2/9]^(1/3) more accurately.

Compute 2/9 = 0.2222...

Compute x^3 = 0.2222.

What's 0.6 cubed? 0.216. 0.62^3=0.238. So 0.62^3=0.238, which is larger than 0.222.

So 0.6^3 = 0.216, 0.62^3=0.238.

0.222 is between 0.6 and 0.62. Let's interpolate.

Let's say f(x) = x³.

We have f(0.6) = 0.216, f(0.615) = ?

0.615^3 = let's compute:

0.6^3 = 0.216.

0.015^3 is negligible, but cross terms:

(0.6 + 0.015)^3 = 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2*(0.015) + 3*(0.6)*(0.015)^2 + (0.015)^3.

= 0.216 + 3*(0.36)(0.015) + 3*(0.6)(0.000225) + 0.000003375

= 0.216 + 0.0162 + 0.000405 + 0.000003375

≈ 0.216 + 0.0162 = 0.2322 + 0.000405 = 0.2326 + 0.000003375 ≈ 0.2326.

Wait, that's for 0.615^3. But 0.222 is less than that, so maybe I should go lower.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me think.

We can compute [2/9]^(1/3) as (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3)/9^(1/3).

2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26.

9^(1/3) is approximately 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.605.

So [2/9]^(1/3) ≈ 0.605.

So a1 = 0.605 a2.

So R/a1 = R/(0.605 a2) = (1/0.605) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.652 * (R/a2).

So approximately 1.65 times higher.

So Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer would be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the comparison depends on the orbital distance \( a \). 

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left(M_* P^2\right)^{1/3} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

1. **Planet_1**: The host star's mass is \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \), and the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). Substituting into Kepler's law:
   \[
   a_1 \propto \left(2M_{*,2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}M_{*,2}P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
   \]

2. **Planet_2**: The semi-major axis is:
   \[
   a_2 \propto \left(M_{*,2}P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
   \]

Taking the ratio of the two semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2}{9}M_{*,2}P_2^2}{M_{*,2}P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating \( \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \), we find:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \). Substituting this into the transit probability formula:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

**Option C** states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit, which matches the calculation.
