Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta (the angle from the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and determine a possible form of f.

Wait, so the function f depends on lambda and theta. The options give different forms for f and fractions. Let's start by recalling radiation patterns from oscillating dipoles or charges.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is what the radiation zone implies) is directional. The power radiated depends on the angle theta. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum along the equator (theta=90 degrees) and falls off as sin(theta) in some way.

Wait, wait. No, wait. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis. So the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, and it goes to zero at theta=0 and 180 degrees. The formula is something like (sin(theta))^2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's proportional to sin^2(theta), so the maximum is when sin(theta) is 1, which is theta=90 degrees.

Wait, but the problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal. Hmm, a dipole is more like a very long charge distribution, but a spheroid might be more like an oscillating dipole. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quadrupole? Wait, no, the problem states it's oscillating, so the primary radiation should be from a dipole term.

But wait, the radiation from a dipole is given by the electric dipole formula. The power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. But when considering radiation patterns, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) as a function of theta is given by a certain formula.

Wait, the formula for the intensity (which is the power per unit area per unit solid angle) from an electric dipole is given by I = ( (μ_0/(4π)) * ( ( (p'' )^2 ) * sin^2(theta) ) ) / c^2, where p'' is the second derivative of the dipole moment with respect to time, and c is the speed of light. So the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta).

Wait, but when we talk about the power per unit solid angle, the solid angle element is dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the power in a particular direction is the intensity multiplied by the solid angle element. But the question is phrased as "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of lambda and theta." So f is the intensity, which is power per unit solid angle.

So for a dipole, f is proportional to sin^2(theta). But wait, the problem states the maximum power is A. So the total power A would be the integral of f over all solid angles.

Wait, no. The total power radiated is the integral of f over all solid angles (4π steradians). So the maximum value of f would be at theta=90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1, so f(theta) is maximum. So the maximum f is f_max = (some constant) * sin^2(theta), so f_max occurs at theta=90 degrees.

But the question is asking about the fraction of A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees. Wait, no. The question says, the maximum power is A. So A is the maximum value of f multiplied by something? Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the function f is power per unit solid angle. So the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f dΩ. But in this case, the maximum value of f is f_max, which occurs at theta=90 degrees, and it's equal to A divided by the solid angle where f is maximum.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum power per unit solid angle is f_max, which occurs at theta=90 degrees. The total power A is the integral of f dΩ over all directions. So A = ∫ f dΩ.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power (A) is the maximum of the radiated power. Oh wait, perhaps A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle, which is f_max. Hmm, but that wouldn't make sense because the total power would be A times the solid angle that contributes the maximum. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps A is the total power radiated, and the power per unit solid angle is f(theta), so to find the fraction of A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees, you need to compute f(theta) at 30 and then divide by A.

But wait, no. Because the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles. So the fraction of A at a particular direction is (f(theta) dΩ) / A. But if they ask for the fraction at theta=30 degrees, perhaps they are considering that the maximum occurs at theta=90, and the question is asking what's the fraction at 30 degrees, but perhaps it's looking for the ratio of f(theta=30) to f(theta=90), which is the maximum.

Wait, the question says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So that would be [f(theta=30) * dΩ] / A. But perhaps the question is simplifying, assuming that the maximum occurs at a specific point and the function is such that f(theta) is maximum at theta=90 and decreases elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is given as a certain form, and we need to find the fraction of A that is emitted at theta=30.

Wait, the problem statement says that the function f is a function of lambda and theta, and we're to find the fraction of A (the maximum power) that is radiated at theta=30, and also determine the possible form of f.

So f is the intensity, so the power in a direction is f(theta) multiplied by the solid angle element. But for small solid angles, it's approximately f(theta) * dΩ.

But the total power is A, which is the integral of f over all solid angles. So if f(theta) is maximum at theta=90, and we're to find the power at theta=30 and a possible form of f.

Wait, I think for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone) is given by a function that depends on theta, and the intensity falls off as 1/lambda^4, since the power is proportional to (acceleration)^2, and acceleration is related to the second derivative of position, which would involve 1/lambda^2, and then squared gives 1/lambda^4.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (e^2 a^2 omega^4)/(c^3), where a is the amplitude of oscillation and omega is the angular frequency. Since omega = 2 pi /lambda, omega^4 is (2 pi)^4 / lambda^4. So the power is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So the function f, which is power per unit solid angle, would also have a 1/lambda^4 dependence.

Now, let's consider the angular dependence. For a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), so f(theta) ~ sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4). So the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, where sin(theta)=1.

Wait, but the problem gives the function f as a function of theta and lambda. So f(theta, lambda) would have a form like sin^2(theta) multiplied by a term in lambda, which is 1/lambda^4.

So the function f would be proportional to sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4), so f ~ sin^2(theta) * lambda^-4.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 1/2, lambda^-4

Option B: 1/4, lambda^-3

Option C: 1/4, lambda^-4

Option D: 3/4, lambda^-6

So the lambda dependence is either -4 or -3 or -6.

Earlier, I thought the power is proportional to 1/lambda^4, so the function f would have a 1/lambda^4 term. So the options A and C have lambda^-4. So the other part is the fraction.

Now, the problem is asking: what's the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees. Wait, A is the maximum power. Or is A the total power radiated?

Wait, the problem says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So A is the maximum value of f (the power per unit solid angle). Wait, no. Because f is power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f is, say, f_max. Then the total power A would be the integral of f over all solid angles, which is 4π, but that depends on the specific form.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:

If f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle, then the total power A is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles (from theta=0 to pi, phi=0 to 2pi). So A = ∫ f(theta) sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

If f(theta) = K * sin^2(theta) * (1/lambda^4), then the integral becomes:

A = K * ∫ (from 0 to pi) sin^3(theta) dtheta * ∫ (from 0 to 2pi) dphi * (1/lambda^4).

The phi integral is 2pi. The theta integral of sin^3(theta) from 0 to pi is (4/3). So A = K * (2pi) * (4/3) * (1/lambda^4) ) = K * (8 pi/3) * (1/lambda^4).

But wait, the function f is the intensity, so the total power is the integral of f over solid angle.

But the problem states that A is the maximum power radiated. Wait, no, the maximum power is when the intensity is maximum. So f_max is A? No, that can't be, because f is the intensity, so the maximum value would be f_max = K * 1 * (1/lambda^4) ) = K / lambda^4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle, which would be the f_max.

Wait, no, because A is the maximum power (total) radiated. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach.

Suppose f(theta) = (something) * sin^2(theta) * lambda^-4. The maximum of f(theta) is when sin(theta) is 1, so f_max = (something) * (1) * lambda^-4. Then the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles. So A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ = ∫ (something) sin^2(theta) * lambda^-4 * sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

Which is (something) * lambda^-4 * ∫ sin^3(theta) dtheta ∫ dphi. The phi integral is 2pi. The theta integral is (4/3). So A = (something) * lambda^-4 * (2pi * 4/3) ) = something * (8 pi/3) * lambda^-4.

But the maximum intensity is f_max = something * lambda^-4.

So the ratio of f(theta=30) to A would be [f(theta=30) ] / A.

Wait, no. Because A is the total power. So the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees would be [f(theta=30) * dΩ(theta=30)] / A.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So perhaps they're considering the fraction of the maximum intensity. Or perhaps the fraction of the total power radiated in that direction.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the fraction of the maximum power (f_max) that is radiated at that angle. Or perhaps it's the fraction of the total power (A) radiated at theta=30. But the way the question is phrased, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30", I think it's the latter.

So the fraction would be (f(theta=30) * dΩ) / A.

Wait, but dΩ is the solid angle at theta=30. Wait, no, because the question is asking for the fraction at theta=30 degrees, but perhaps considering a small solid angle around it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the maximum value at 30 degrees, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the power at theta=30 to the maximum power A.

Wait, let me think again. The maximum power per unit solid angle is A, and the power at theta=30 is f(theta=30). So the fraction would be f(theta=30) / A.

But wait, A is the maximum. But that would be the case if A is the maximum value of f. So f(theta=30) = f_max * sin^2(theta=30) = A * sin^2(30). So sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So f(theta=30) = 0.25 A.

But A is the maximum, so then the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30 is 0.25 A / A = 0.25. So 1/4.

Wait, but that would be the case if A is the maximum value of f. But earlier, I thought A is the total power. So perhaps that's where I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, if A is the total power, which is the integral of f over all solid angles, then the fraction at theta=30 is [f(theta=30) * dΩ(theta=30)] / A. But for a point direction, the solid angle is zero. So maybe the problem is considering a differential solid angle, but that's not what the question is asking.

Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So it's about the fraction of the total power A that is emitted in the direction theta=30 degrees. So the fraction is [f(theta=30) dΩ(theta=30)] / A.

But wait, the solid angle element dΩ is sin(theta) dtheta dphi. To find the fraction, perhaps we're considering a small solid angle around theta=30, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and just taking f(theta=30) / A as the fraction, but that's not correct because you have to multiply by the solid angle.

Wait, no. Because f is the intensity, which is power per unit solid angle. So the power in a direction is f(theta) * dΩ. But the maximum power per unit solid angle is at theta=90, which is f_max.

So if A is the total power, then A = ∫ f(theta) dΩ. So the fraction at theta=30 is [f(theta=30) dΩ(theta=30)] / A. But that's only for an infinitesimal solid angle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the maximum direction, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the power at theta=30 to the maximum power. So if A is the maximum power (per unit solid angle), then the fraction would be f(theta=30) / A = sin^2(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So in that case, the fraction is 1/4, which matches option C or B.

But earlier, the function f was proportional to sin^2(theta) / lambda^4, so the lambda dependence is 1/lambda^4.

So looking at the options, option C has 1/4 as the fraction and lambda^(-4). So option C would be 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the fraction is 1/4 and f is proportional to lambda^-4.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the maximum f is at theta=90 degrees, which is f_max = (some constant) * (1/lambda^4). At theta=30, it's f(theta=30) = (some constant) * sin^2(30) * (1/lambda^4) = (some constant) * (1/4) * (1/lambda^4). So the fraction is 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to lambda^-4. So the correct option would be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength $\lambda$. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function $f(\lambda, \theta)$, and the maximum power radiated is $A$. The goal is to determine the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the possible form of $f$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta)$. This means the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is maximum at $\theta = 90^\circ$ and decreases as $\sin^2(\theta)$ for other angles.

2. **Wavelength Dependence**:  
   The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to $\omega^4$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. Since $\omega = 2\pi/\lambda$, the power dependence on $\lambda$ is $1/\lambda^4$. Thus, the function $f$ is proportional to $\sin^2(\theta) \cdot \lambda^{-4}$.

3. **Fraction of Total Power at $\theta = 30^\circ$**:  
   The total power $A$ is the integral of $f$ over all solid angles. The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is proportional to $f(\theta = 30^\circ)$ relative to the maximum intensity. At $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Therefore, the fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$.

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   - Option A: Fraction $1/2$, $\lambda^{-4}$ (incorrect fraction).  
   - Option B: Fraction $1/4$, $\lambda^{-3}$ (incorrect $\lambda$ dependence).  
   - Option C: Fraction $1/4$, $\lambda^{-4}$ (correct).  
   - Option D: Fraction $3/4$, $\lambda^{-6}$ (incorrect fraction and $\lambda$ dependence).

### Conclusion:  
The fraction of $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the function $f$ has the form $\lambda^{-4}$. The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
