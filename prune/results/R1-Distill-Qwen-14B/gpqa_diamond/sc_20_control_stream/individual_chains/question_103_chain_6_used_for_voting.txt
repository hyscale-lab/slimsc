Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group attached to an ethanone. On the benzene ring, there are substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, 3-bromo and 5-nitro groups. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, actually, benzene has six positions. If the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring, which are meta to each other.

Now, benzene is the starting material. So I need to introduce these substituents in the correct order. The ketone group is an ethanone, so probably introduced via an acylation reaction.

I remember that in aromatic substitution reactions, the order of introducing substituents is important because activating and deactivating groups direct the incoming substituents to specific positions.

The substituents we're adding are nitro (a strong meta director) and bromine (also a meta director, but I think it's via a different mechanism). The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would be a meta director as well.

Wait, but the order in which we introduce these substituents will determine the positions. Let's think: if I first nitrate benzene, I'll get nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. Then, if I add another nitro group, it would go into the para position relative to the first nitro, but wait, the target has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the ketone group first. Wait, but benzene is a benzene ring, so we can't directly introduce a ketone. Oh wait, maybe via Friedel-Crafts acylation. So first, I can do Friedel-Crafts to add an acetyl group (CH3CO-) to benzene, forming acetophenone. Then, the next substituents can be added.

Wait, but acetophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director. So the next substituents would come into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

But in the target molecule, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So perhaps after adding the ketone, I need to add nitro and bromo groups in the correct positions.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro comes first, then the bromo, then the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the directing effects. Nitration is a meta-directing group when already present on the ring. Bromination with FeBr3 is also a meta director. The ketone (from Friedel-Crafts) is also meta directing.

So the key is to get the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me plan the steps:

1. First, maybe introduce the nitro group in the para position relative to where the ketone will go? Or meta?

Wait, perhaps the synthesis should go like this:

Start with benzene.

Step 1: Nitrate benzene. Nitration of benzene would introduce a nitro group in the para or meta positions, but since it's the first substituent, it would be in one position, say position 1. Wait, no, the first substituent comes at position 1, but when adding substituents, the next comes relative to that.

Wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the first substituent can be considered at position 1. Then, when adding the second substituent, it can be at position 3 (meta) or 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But nitro is a meta director, so when adding another substituent, it would go into the meta position.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have two substituents on the benzene ring: nitro and bromo, plus the ketone. The ketone is presumably in position 1, then nitro is at 3, bromo at 5.

Wait, let me draw this:

Positions:

1: ketone (from ethan-1-one, so the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group)

3: bromo

5: nitro

So the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

So, after adding the ketone group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, the next substituents (bromo and nitro) must be introduced into the 3 and 5 positions.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acyl group as an activating, ortho/para director. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for activating groups, but the acyl group is deactivating. Wait, no, wait. The acyl group is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group, so it is a meta director.

So after introducing the acetyl group (position 1), the next substituent would come into the meta position relative to it, which is position 3 or 5, depending on where it's added.

Wait, but if I first add the nitro group, which is also a meta director, but if I add it after the acetyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro and bromo groups before the acetyl group. Because introducing the acetyl group (which is deactivating) after nitro and bromo would be difficult since the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, nitro and bromine are strong deactivating groups. If the ring is already deactivated, Friedel-Crafts acylation (which requires an activating ring) wouldn't proceed. So perhaps the acylation must happen before nitration and bromination.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if I have to introduce the nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, I need to do that before the acylation? But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, so benzene is activating enough. But nitration is done under strongly acidic conditions and uses nitric acid and sulfuric acid as a nitrating mixture.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, nitro group is added, making the ring very deactivating. Then, Friedel-Crafts would not work because the ring is deactivated. So nitration should happen after the acylation.

Wait, but how? Because if the acylation (Friedel-Crafts) is done first, the ring is activated at the position of the acetyl group (which is actually deactivating), so the next substituents would go meta to the acetyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1 has acetyl)

2. Then, introduce nitro group into the meta position (position 3)

3. Then, introduce bromine into the meta position relative to the acetyl group, which would be position 5.

Wait, but then the nitro and bromo would both be meta to the acetyl group. But in the target, nitro is at 5 and bromo is at 3. So that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced after the nitro, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, but let's think about the steps. Each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity.

Another approach: the target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl (position 1), nitro (position 5), and bromo (position 3). So positions 1,3,5 are substituted.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (position 1)

But wait, that would have nitro in position 1. Then, when we introduce the acetyl group, it needs to go to a position that's activated. Wait, but nitro is a deactivating, meta director. So the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

So if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent would go to position 3 or 5. But the acetyl group is a deactivating group, so perhaps introducing it after nitro is not feasible because nitro makes the ring too deactivating.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro and bromo.

So step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1 has acetyl).

Step 2: Nitration. Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro group would be added at position 3 or 5.

Wait, if the acetyl is at position 1, then the meta positions are 3 and 5. So nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say we add nitro at position 3.

Then, step 3: bromination. The ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, where would bromine go? The nitro is a meta director, and the acetyl is also a meta director. So the next substituent would be directed to the position that is meta to both. Hmm, but that's tricky.

Wait, maybe the bromine would go into position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group. Because the nitro at 3 is a meta director, so the bromine would go to position 5 (which is meta to 3) or position 6 (para to 3). Wait, but if the acetyl is at 1, and nitro at 3, then position 5 is meta to 1 and adjacent to 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine would be added para to the nitro group. Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the bromine would go into the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 6 (if nitro is at 3, then meta is 6). But that's position 6, which is not what we want.

Wait, our target has bromo at position 3, but if the acetyl is at 1, then position 3 is meta to 1. So perhaps after acylation, nitrating would put nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would go to position 5. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. After acylation (position 1), nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Now, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, when we brominate, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3), which are both meta directors. The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

But where would the next substituent go? The acetyl at 1 would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5 (meta to 1). The nitro at 3 would direct to positions 1,5,6. Hmm, the overlapping positions that are activated would be position 5.

So bromine would go to position 5. So now we have substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 (bromo). But wait, the target has bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait no, the target is 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So in my current plan, I've added nitro at 3 and bromo at 5. But the target has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So that's reversed.

Ah, so maybe the nitration should be done after bromine. Wait, but that's not possible because we can't brominate before acylation because acylation needs an activating ring.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added first, then the nitro. Let's think:

Start with benzene.

Step 1: Brominate benzene with FeBr3. So we get bromobenzene, with Br at position 1.

Step 2: Nitrate bromobenzene. Since Br is a meta director, the nitro group would go into position 3 (meta to Br).

Now, our substituents are at 1 (Br) and 3 (nitro).

Step 3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ring has Br and nitro groups, which are both deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So that's a problem. So after nitration, the ring is highly deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So this approach won't work. So perhaps the acylation must be done before nitration and bromination.

Wait, but how then to get the nitro and bromo into the correct positions.

Let's try another approach. Let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's try to analyze them.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene becomes acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Now, where? The acetophenone is a meta director. So Br would go into meta to acetyl, which would be position 3 or 5.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, where? The ring has acetyl (position 1) and Br (position 3). Nitration would be directed by both. Acetyl is meta director, Br is also meta. So possible positions: where? The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3. The acetyl directs to 3 and 5. The Br at 3 directs to 1,5,6. So the overlapping position is 5.

So nitration would add nitro at position 5. So now, substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). But wait, the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. So this is correct. But wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So that's exactly what we have here.

Wait, but wait, our target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which would have the substituents at 3 and 5. So in this case, the sequence would lead to the desired product.

But let's see what the rest of the steps are in option A.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction. Wait, what's that for? Maybe it's a step for removing a substituent.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Hmm, but we already have nitro and Br. Why nitrate again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Probably for introducing another group.

vii) H3PO2 → what's that? I think H3PO2 is used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Or wait, H3PO2 is used in the hydroxyaminolysis, but perhaps in some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the entire process.

In option A, after steps i and ii, we have Br at 3 and acetyl at 1. Then, step iii is nitration which adds nitro at 5. So now, the molecule has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe in HCl is used for reduction, perhaps for removing a nitro group. So if we have a nitro group at 5, reducing it would give an amino group. But that's not in the target.

Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is for something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each reagent.

CH3COCl with AlCl3 is Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Br2 with FeBr3 is bromination.

HNO3 and H2SO4: nitration.

Fe and HCl: likely a reduction step, perhaps of a nitro group to an amine, but that's not in the target.

Wait, but the target has Br and nitro, so perhaps the steps after nitration are unnecessary.

Wait, maybe in option A, step iv is a reduction of the nitro group, but that would change the substituent, which we don't want. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions.

Wait, perhaps after Friedel-Crafts acylation, the next step is bromination, which adds Br at position 3. Then nitration adds nitro at position 5. So the substituents would be at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro), which matches the target.

But then, steps iv to vii in option A would be extra steps that alter the structure, which we don't need. So perhaps option A isn't the right one because the target is achieved after step iii.

But looking at the options, they all have seven steps. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the target is achieved after some steps, but further steps are needed to modify other groups. Let me think.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, so the substituents are Br at 3 and nitro at 5, with the ketone at 1.

So, if after steps i, ii, iii we already have that structure, but then the subsequent steps (iv to vii) would modify it. So perhaps those steps are not needed, but the options require all steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option doesn't require all steps but only the necessary ones. But the options give sequences of steps, so perhaps the correct sequence is the one that, when all steps are done, leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate each option step by step.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro group to amine. So nitrobenzene becomes aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so would the acylation go in. Wait, but aniline is already a meta director because the amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when we acylate aniline, the acetyl would go into ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

Wait, but after acylation, the amino group is converted to a meta director because it's now N-acetylaniline. So that's a deactivating group. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C would lead to a different product.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium chloride? Wait, H3PO2 is usually used for the hydroxyaminolysis, but perhaps in some cases it could be used for substitution. Alternatively, H3PO2 reduces nitro groups to amines if present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the correct order of substituents.

We have to have nitro at 5 and bromo at 3, with the ketone at 1.

So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

The correct order would be to first add the acetyl group (position 1), then nitro at 3, then bromo at 5. Or vice versa, but considering the directing effects.

Wait, but after adding the acetyl group, the ring is deactivating. So nitration would happen next, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then acetylation, then bromination.

Wait, let me try that:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

2. Friedel-Crafts acylation: but nitro is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So that's not possible.

Hmm. So acylation must come first, before nitration and bromination.

So step 1: Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone (position 1).

Step 2: Nitration → nitro group at position 3 (meta to acetyl).

Step 3: Bromination → where? The ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Both are meta directors.

Possible positions: 2 (ortho to acetyl, but that's deactivating), 4 (para to acetyl), 5 (meta to acetyl and para to nitro?), 6 (ortho to nitro, which is meta to acetyl).

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, nitro at 3.

Acetyl directs meta: positions 3 and 5.

Nitro at 3 directs meta: positions 1, 5, 6.

So the common position is 5.

So bromination would add Br at position 5.

But our target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are swapped.

So after acylation, bromination would add Br at position 3, then nitration would add nitro at position 5.

That would give the correct substituents.

But can that happen? Let's see.

After Friedel-Crafts (step 1: acetyl at 1).

Step 2: bromination with FeBr3. Since acetyl is meta director, Br would go to position 3 or 5.

If it's added at position 3, then next step is nitration, which would be directed by acetyl (meta) and Br (meta).

So nitro would go to position 5.

That would give acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Which matches the target.

So the steps would be:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetyl.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

But looking at the options, which option has these steps in order.

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So that's the sequence we need.

But in option A, after step iii, there are more steps:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Wait, but that would change the substituents. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct. Let me check option C.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because it's deactivating. So step iii in option C is acylation. But nitro is a meta director, so acylation would go to position 3.

Wait, let me think.

Option C steps:

1. Nitrate benzene: nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine: so we have aniline.

3. Acylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. Aniline is ortho/para director, but after acylation, the amine becomes N-acetyl, which is a meta director.

So acylation would occur at position 3 or 5.

But wait, after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is activated again. So acylation would happen at ortho or para to the amine.

Assuming the amine is at position 1, acylation would happen at position 3 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 1 is arbitrary. Let's say the amine is at position 1.

So acylation would go to position 3 or 4.

If it goes to position 3, then step iv is Br2/FeBr3. But then the ring has amine (1) and acetyl (3). Amine is ortho/para director, acetyl is meta.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe this option isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

Br is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5.

Now, substituents at 1 (Br) and 3 (nitro).

Step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, both deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is invalid.

So option B is out.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to something.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This seems convoluted. Let me see if it can lead to the target.

But after step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: diazotize amine → diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts. For example, with H2O, it gives phenol. So after step iv, the ring would have a hydroxyl group at position 1.

Step v: brominate. Since phenol is a strong activating, ortho/para director, Br would go into ortho or para.

But we need Br at 3, nitro at 5.

This seems to diverge from the target.

Hmm.

So now, evaluating all the options, the most plausible is option A, which has the steps: acylation, bromination, nitration. Which would result in the correct substituents.

But then, option A has steps iv to vii which might alter the structure. Wait, perhaps after step iii, the desired product is achieved, but the subsequent steps are unnecessary. But the question asks for the sequence that leads to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps those steps are not needed, but in the options, all options have seven steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that some steps are for protection or other functional group transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I need to reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about the initial steps again. The target has substituents at 1,3,5. So after acylation (1), nitration would go to 3 or 5, and bromination to the other.

But in option A, after step iii, we have Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So the target is achieved. But in the options, all sequences have seven steps. So perhaps in option A, steps iv to vii are for something else, but that's not necessary.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the reagents.

In option A:

After step iii, we have the correct substituents, but what's the product at that point?

It's 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the target. So why are there more steps?

Ah, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. So the substituents are on the benzene ring. So perhaps the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis but are extra steps for something else. But the options have all seven steps, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are for modifying other groups. For example, maybe the nitro group is reduced to amino, then something else happens.

But in the target, the nitro group is present. So steps that reduce it would be incorrect.

So perhaps option A is the correct one, but I'm not considering that the later steps are not needed. But the question states that the sequence must lead to the target, so perhaps the correct steps are the initial ones, and the rest are not part of the correct pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way: what is the correct order of substituents.

The correct substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5). So the steps to achieve this are:

1. Acylation → acetyl at 1.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

So the sequence is steps i, ii, iii in option A.

But in option A, the steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But why would you nitrate again? It would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

This would change the structure, which we don't want. So perhaps the correct option is the one that only includes steps i, ii, iii, but the option must have all seven steps. Hence, none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the steps in the options.

Let me look again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation (step 1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination (step 2).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration (step 3).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So after step iii, the product is correct, but steps iv to vii modify it, which would change the structure. So that's not correct.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromine.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 5.

iii) acylation → acetyl would go to 3 (since Br is at 1, nitro at 5; acetyl would have to go somewhere else).

But Friedel-Crafts won't work because of deactivating substituents.

So option B is invalid.

Option C:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) acylation → acetyl would go to 3 or 4.

iv) Br2 → bromination. So where would Br go?

If substituents are amine (1) and acetyl (3), Br would go to positions 2,4,5,6.

But acetyl is meta director, so Br would go to 6 (meta to 3), which is position 6.

Hmm, but the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

So perhaps not.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) reduce → amine at 1.

iii) NaNO2 → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination. Phenol is an activating group, so Br would go into ortho or para.

vi) acylation → acetyl would go into positions activated by phenol.

But we need acetyl at 1, which is now a hydroxyl group. So acylation won't happen at position 1.

This seems not to lead to the target.

So perhaps the correct sequence is option A, despite the extra steps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, perhaps in option C, the steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) acylation → acetyl at 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Br2 → Br would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl).

v) HNO3 → nitrate again, but where?

Wait, but after step iv, substituents are amine (1), acetyl (3), Br (5). Then step v is nitration. Where?

The amine (1) is now aniline, but after acylation, it's N-acetylaniline, which is a meta director. Acetyl (3) is a meta director. Br (5) is a meta director.

So possible positions for nitration would be positions 2,4,6.

But the target only has nitro at 5, which is already substituted with Br. So this seems incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the subsequent steps are for protection or other purposes. But I'm not sure. Since I'm stuck, I'll have to go with the initial plan.

The correct order of steps is acylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has these steps as steps i, ii, iii. But in the target, the nitro is at 5, which would be the case. So option A would give the correct product after step iii. But the question requires all seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes acylation, bromination, nitration in the first three steps, and the rest are perhaps irrelevant or incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says it's a high-yield synthesis. If option A's steps iv to vii are necessary, but they alter the product, then option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking for the order of substituents.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ketone.

So the substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro), with the ketone at 1.

So the correct order is to introduce the substituents in a way that they are meta to each other relative to the acetyl group.

I think the correct sequence is:

1. Acetophenone (acylation).

2. Bromine at 3.

3. Nitro at 5.

So the steps are i, ii, iii in option A.

Therefore, the correct option is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the correct positions relative to the ketone group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5 on the benzene ring. The order of introducing these substituents is critical due to the directing effects of the groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with FeBr3 adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places the substituents at the desired positions. However, steps iv to vii (Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) are unnecessary and would alter the product, deviating from the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination adds bromine at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making this sequence invalid.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would introduce the ketone group, but the amine is an ortho/para director, leading to incorrect positioning of the ketone. This sequence does not yield the desired product.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization and hydrolysis with H3PO2 convert the amine to a hydroxyl group.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination would add bromine, but the hydroxyl group is an ortho/para director, leading to incorrect positioning. This sequence does not yield the desired product.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acylation, bromination, and nitration, as described in **Option A**. While steps iv to vii in Option A are unnecessary and would alter the product, the first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice among the given options.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group attached to an ethanone. On the benzene ring, there are substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, 3-bromo and 5-nitro groups. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, actually, benzene has six positions. If the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring, which are meta to each other.

Now, benzene is the starting material. So I need to introduce these substituents in the correct order. The ketone group is an ethanone, so probably introduced via an acylation reaction.

I remember that in aromatic substitution reactions, the order of introducing substituents is important because activating and deactivating groups direct the incoming substituents to specific positions.

The substituents we're adding are nitro (a strong meta director) and bromine (also a meta director, but I think it's via a different mechanism). The ketone group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would be a meta director as well.

Wait, but the order in which we introduce these substituents will determine the positions. Let's think: if I first nitrate benzene, I'll get nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. Then, if I add another nitro group, it would go into the para position relative to the first nitro, but wait, the target has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the ketone group first. Wait, but benzene is a benzene ring, so we can't directly introduce a ketone. Oh wait, maybe via Friedel-Crafts acylation. So first, I can do Friedel-Crafts to add an acetyl group (CH3CO-) to benzene, forming acetophenone. Then, the next substituents can be added.

Wait, but acetophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta director. So the next substituents would come into the meta positions relative to the ketone.

But in the target molecule, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So perhaps after adding the ketone, I need to add nitro and bromo groups in the correct positions.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro comes first, then the bromo, then the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the directing effects. Nitration is a meta-directing group when already present on the ring. Bromination with FeBr3 is also a meta director. The ketone (from Friedel-Crafts) is also meta directing.

So the key is to get the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me plan the steps:

1. First, maybe introduce the nitro group in the para position relative to where the ketone will go? Or meta?

Wait, perhaps the synthesis should go like this:

Start with benzene.

Step 1: Nitrate benzene. Nitration of benzene would introduce a nitro group in the para or meta positions, but since it's the first substituent, it would be in one position, say position 1. Wait, no, the first substituent comes at position 1, but when adding substituents, the next comes relative to that.

Wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the first substituent can be considered at position 1. Then, when adding the second substituent, it can be at position 3 (meta) or 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But nitro is a meta director, so when adding another substituent, it would go into the meta position.

Wait, but in the target molecule, we have two substituents on the benzene ring: nitro and bromo, plus the ketone. The ketone is presumably in position 1, then nitro is at 3, bromo at 5.

Wait, let me draw this:

Positions:

1: ketone (from ethan-1-one, so the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group)

3: bromo

5: nitro

So the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

So, after adding the ketone group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, the next substituents (bromo and nitro) must be introduced into the 3 and 5 positions.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the acyl group as an activating, ortho/para director. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for activating groups, but the acyl group is deactivating. Wait, no, wait. The acyl group is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group, so it is a meta director.

So after introducing the acetyl group (position 1), the next substituent would come into the meta position relative to it, which is position 3 or 5, depending on where it's added.

Wait, but if I first add the nitro group, which is also a meta director, but if I add it after the acetyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro and bromo groups before the acetyl group. Because introducing the acetyl group (which is deactivating) after nitro and bromo would be difficult since the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, nitro and bromine are strong deactivating groups. If the ring is already deactivated, Friedel-Crafts acylation (which requires an activating ring) wouldn't proceed. So perhaps the acylation must happen before nitration and bromination.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if I have to introduce the nitro group, which is a strong deactivating group, I need to do that before the acylation? But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, so benzene is activating enough. But nitration is done under strongly acidic conditions and uses nitric acid and sulfuric acid as a nitrating mixture.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, nitro group is added, making the ring very deactivating. Then, Friedel-Crafts would not work because the ring is deactivated. So nitration should happen after the acylation.

Wait, but how? Because if the acylation (Friedel-Crafts) is done first, the ring is activated at the position of the acetyl group (which is actually deactivating), so the next substituents would go meta to the acetyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1 has acetyl)

2. Then, introduce nitro group into the meta position (position 3)

3. Then, introduce bromine into the meta position relative to the acetyl group, which would be position 5.

Wait, but then the nitro and bromo would both be meta to the acetyl group. But in the target, nitro is at 5 and bromo is at 3. So that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced after the nitro, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, but let's think about the steps. Each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity.

Another approach: the target has three substituents on benzene: acetyl (position 1), nitro (position 5), and bromo (position 3). So positions 1,3,5 are substituted.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (position 1)

But wait, that would have nitro in position 1. Then, when we introduce the acetyl group, it needs to go to a position that's activated. Wait, but nitro is a deactivating, meta director. So the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

So if nitro is at position 1, the next substituent would go to position 3 or 5. But the acetyl group is a deactivating group, so perhaps introducing it after nitro is not feasible because nitro makes the ring too deactivating.

Alternatively, maybe the acetyl is introduced first, then nitro and bromo.

So step 1: Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1 has acetyl).

Step 2: Nitration. Since the acetyl is a meta director, the nitro group would be added at position 3 or 5.

Wait, if the acetyl is at position 1, then the meta positions are 3 and 5. So nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say we add nitro at position 3.

Then, step 3: bromination. The ring has acetyl at 1 and nitro at 3. Now, where would bromine go? The nitro is a meta director, and the acetyl is also a meta director. So the next substituent would be directed to the position that is meta to both. Hmm, but that's tricky.

Wait, maybe the bromine would go into position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group. Because the nitro at 3 is a meta director, so the bromine would go to position 5 (which is meta to 3) or position 6 (para to 3). Wait, but if the acetyl is at 1, and nitro at 3, then position 5 is meta to 1 and adjacent to 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine would be added para to the nitro group. Wait, but nitro is a meta director, so the bromine would go into the meta position relative to nitro, which would be position 6 (if nitro is at 3, then meta is 6). But that's position 6, which is not what we want.

Wait, our target has bromo at position 3, but if the acetyl is at 1, then position 3 is meta to 1. So perhaps after acylation, nitrating would put nitro at position 3. Then, bromination would go to position 5. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. After acylation (position 1), nitration would add nitro at position 3 (meta to acetyl). Now, the substituents are at 1 and 3. Now, when we brominate, the ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3), which are both meta directors. The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

But where would the next substituent go? The acetyl at 1 would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5 (meta to 1). The nitro at 3 would direct to positions 1,5,6. Hmm, the overlapping positions that are activated would be position 5.

So bromine would go to position 5. So now we have substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (nitro), and 5 (bromo). But wait, the target has bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait no, the target is 3-bromo and 5-nitro. So in my current plan, I've added nitro at 3 and bromo at 5. But the target has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So that's reversed.

Ah, so maybe the nitration should be done after bromine. Wait, but that's not possible because we can't brominate before acylation because acylation needs an activating ring.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added first, then the nitro. Let's think:

Start with benzene.

Step 1: Brominate benzene with FeBr3. So we get bromobenzene, with Br at position 1.

Step 2: Nitrate bromobenzene. Since Br is a meta director, the nitro group would go into position 3 (meta to Br).

Now, our substituents are at 1 (Br) and 3 (nitro).

Step 3: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, the ring has Br and nitro groups, which are both deactivating. Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So that's a problem. So after nitration, the ring is highly deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So this approach won't work. So perhaps the acylation must be done before nitration and bromination.

Wait, but how then to get the nitro and bromo into the correct positions.

Let's try another approach. Let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's try to analyze them.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. So benzene becomes acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Now, where? The acetophenone is a meta director. So Br would go into meta to acetyl, which would be position 3 or 5.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, where? The ring has acetyl (position 1) and Br (position 3). Nitration would be directed by both. Acetyl is meta director, Br is also meta. So possible positions: where? The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3. The acetyl directs to 3 and 5. The Br at 3 directs to 1,5,6. So the overlapping position is 5.

So nitration would add nitro at position 5. So now, substituents are 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). But wait, the target has nitro at 5 and Br at 3. So this is correct. But wait, the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So that's exactly what we have here.

Wait, but wait, our target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which would have the substituents at 3 and 5. So in this case, the sequence would lead to the desired product.

But let's see what the rest of the steps are in option A.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduction. Wait, what's that for? Maybe it's a step for removing a substituent.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. Hmm, but we already have nitro and Br. Why nitrate again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Probably for introducing another group.

vii) H3PO2 → what's that? I think H3PO2 is used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Or wait, H3PO2 is used in the hydroxyaminolysis, but perhaps in some other reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the entire process.

In option A, after steps i and ii, we have Br at 3 and acetyl at 1. Then, step iii is nitration which adds nitro at 5. So now, the molecule has acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Then, step iv is Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe in HCl is used for reduction, perhaps for removing a nitro group. So if we have a nitro group at 5, reducing it would give an amino group. But that's not in the target.

Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is for something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each reagent.

CH3COCl with AlCl3 is Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Br2 with FeBr3 is bromination.

HNO3 and H2SO4: nitration.

Fe and HCl: likely a reduction step, perhaps of a nitro group to an amine, but that's not in the target.

Wait, but the target has Br and nitro, so perhaps the steps after nitration are unnecessary.

Wait, maybe in option A, step iv is a reduction of the nitro group, but that would change the substituent, which we don't want. So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the positions.

Wait, perhaps after Friedel-Crafts acylation, the next step is bromination, which adds Br at position 3. Then nitration adds nitro at position 5. So the substituents would be at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro), which matches the target.

But then, steps iv to vii in option A would be extra steps that alter the structure, which we don't need. So perhaps option A isn't the right one because the target is achieved after step iii.

But looking at the options, they all have seven steps. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the target is achieved after some steps, but further steps are needed to modify other groups. Let me think.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, so the substituents are Br at 3 and nitro at 5, with the ketone at 1.

So, if after steps i, ii, iii we already have that structure, but then the subsequent steps (iv to vii) would modify it. So perhaps those steps are not needed, but the options require all steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option doesn't require all steps but only the necessary ones. But the options give sequences of steps, so perhaps the correct sequence is the one that, when all steps are done, leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate each option step by step.

Looking at option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro group to amine. So nitrobenzene becomes aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, so would the acylation go in. Wait, but aniline is already a meta director because the amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So when we acylate aniline, the acetyl would go into ortho or para positions relative to the amino group.

Wait, but after acylation, the amino group is converted to a meta director because it's now N-acetylaniline. So that's a deactivating group. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C would lead to a different product.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium chloride? Wait, H3PO2 is usually used for the hydroxyaminolysis, but perhaps in some cases it could be used for substitution. Alternatively, H3PO2 reduces nitro groups to amines if present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the correct order of substituents.

We have to have nitro at 5 and bromo at 3, with the ketone at 1.

So, the substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

The correct order would be to first add the acetyl group (position 1), then nitro at 3, then bromo at 5. Or vice versa, but considering the directing effects.

Wait, but after adding the acetyl group, the ring is deactivating. So nitration would happen next, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then acetylation, then bromination.

Wait, let me try that:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

2. Friedel-Crafts acylation: but nitro is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So that's not possible.

Hmm. So acylation must come first, before nitration and bromination.

So step 1: Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone (position 1).

Step 2: Nitration → nitro group at position 3 (meta to acetyl).

Step 3: Bromination → where? The ring has acetyl (1) and nitro (3). Both are meta directors.

Possible positions: 2 (ortho to acetyl, but that's deactivating), 4 (para to acetyl), 5 (meta to acetyl and para to nitro?), 6 (ortho to nitro, which is meta to acetyl).

Wait, the acetyl is at 1, nitro at 3.

Acetyl directs meta: positions 3 and 5.

Nitro at 3 directs meta: positions 1, 5, 6.

So the common position is 5.

So bromination would add Br at position 5.

But our target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the nitration and bromination steps are swapped.

So after acylation, bromination would add Br at position 3, then nitration would add nitro at position 5.

That would give the correct substituents.

But can that happen? Let's see.

After Friedel-Crafts (step 1: acetyl at 1).

Step 2: bromination with FeBr3. Since acetyl is meta director, Br would go to position 3 or 5.

If it's added at position 3, then next step is nitration, which would be directed by acetyl (meta) and Br (meta).

So nitro would go to position 5.

That would give acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Which matches the target.

So the steps would be:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetyl.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

But looking at the options, which option has these steps in order.

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So that's the sequence we need.

But in option A, after step iii, there are more steps:

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Wait, but that would change the substituents. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct. Let me check option C.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because it's deactivating. So step iii in option C is acylation. But nitro is a meta director, so acylation would go to position 3.

Wait, let me think.

Option C steps:

1. Nitrate benzene: nitro at position 1.

2. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine: so we have aniline.

3. Acylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. Aniline is ortho/para director, but after acylation, the amine becomes N-acetyl, which is a meta director.

So acylation would occur at position 3 or 5.

But wait, after reducing nitro to amine, the ring is activated again. So acylation would happen at ortho or para to the amine.

Assuming the amine is at position 1, acylation would happen at position 3 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 1 is arbitrary. Let's say the amine is at position 1.

So acylation would go to position 3 or 4.

If it goes to position 3, then step iv is Br2/FeBr3. But then the ring has amine (1) and acetyl (3). Amine is ortho/para director, acetyl is meta.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe this option isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

Br is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 5.

Now, substituents at 1 (Br) and 3 (nitro).

Step iii: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation. But the ring has Br and nitro, both deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option B is invalid.

So option B is out.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to something.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

This seems convoluted. Let me see if it can lead to the target.

But after step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine at 1.

Step iii: diazotize amine → diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts. For example, with H2O, it gives phenol. So after step iv, the ring would have a hydroxyl group at position 1.

Step v: brominate. Since phenol is a strong activating, ortho/para director, Br would go into ortho or para.

But we need Br at 3, nitro at 5.

This seems to diverge from the target.

Hmm.

So now, evaluating all the options, the most plausible is option A, which has the steps: acylation, bromination, nitration. Which would result in the correct substituents.

But then, option A has steps iv to vii which might alter the structure. Wait, perhaps after step iii, the desired product is achieved, but the subsequent steps are unnecessary. But the question asks for the sequence that leads to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps those steps are not needed, but in the options, all options have seven steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that some steps are for protection or other functional group transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, but I need to reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about the initial steps again. The target has substituents at 1,3,5. So after acylation (1), nitration would go to 3 or 5, and bromination to the other.

But in option A, after step iii, we have Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So the target is achieved. But in the options, all sequences have seven steps. So perhaps in option A, steps iv to vii are for something else, but that's not necessary.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the reagents.

In option A:

After step iii, we have the correct substituents, but what's the product at that point?

It's 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.

Which is the target. So why are there more steps?

Ah, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. So the substituents are on the benzene ring. So perhaps the steps after iii are not part of the synthesis but are extra steps for something else. But the options have all seven steps, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii are for modifying other groups. For example, maybe the nitro group is reduced to amino, then something else happens.

But in the target, the nitro group is present. So steps that reduce it would be incorrect.

So perhaps option A is the correct one, but I'm not considering that the later steps are not needed. But the question states that the sequence must lead to the target, so perhaps the correct steps are the initial ones, and the rest are not part of the correct pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it another way: what is the correct order of substituents.

The correct substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5). So the steps to achieve this are:

1. Acylation → acetyl at 1.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

So the sequence is steps i, ii, iii in option A.

But in option A, the steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. But why would you nitrate again? It would add another nitro group, which isn't desired.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

This would change the structure, which we don't want. So perhaps the correct option is the one that only includes steps i, ii, iii, but the option must have all seven steps. Hence, none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the steps in the options.

Let me look again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation (step 1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination (step 2).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration (step 3).

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

So after step iii, the product is correct, but steps iv to vii modify it, which would change the structure. So that's not correct.

Option B:

i) Br2 → bromine.

ii) nitrate → nitro at 5.

iii) acylation → acetyl would go to 3 (since Br is at 1, nitro at 5; acetyl would have to go somewhere else).

But Friedel-Crafts won't work because of deactivating substituents.

So option B is invalid.

Option C:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) acylation → acetyl would go to 3 or 4.

iv) Br2 → bromination. So where would Br go?

If substituents are amine (1) and acetyl (3), Br would go to positions 2,4,5,6.

But acetyl is meta director, so Br would go to 6 (meta to 3), which is position 6.

Hmm, but the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

So perhaps not.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) reduce → amine at 1.

iii) NaNO2 → diazonium salt.

iv) H3PO2 → phenol.

v) Br2 → bromination. Phenol is an activating group, so Br would go into ortho or para.

vi) acylation → acetyl would go into positions activated by phenol.

But we need acetyl at 1, which is now a hydroxyl group. So acylation won't happen at position 1.

This seems not to lead to the target.

So perhaps the correct sequence is option A, despite the extra steps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, perhaps in option C, the steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) acylation → acetyl at 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Br2 → Br would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl).

v) HNO3 → nitrate again, but where?

Wait, but after step iv, substituents are amine (1), acetyl (3), Br (5). Then step v is nitration. Where?

The amine (1) is now aniline, but after acylation, it's N-acetylaniline, which is a meta director. Acetyl (3) is a meta director. Br (5) is a meta director.

So possible positions for nitration would be positions 2,4,6.

But the target only has nitro at 5, which is already substituted with Br. So this seems incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the subsequent steps are for protection or other purposes. But I'm not sure. Since I'm stuck, I'll have to go with the initial plan.

The correct order of steps is acylation, bromination, nitration. So option A has these steps as steps i, ii, iii. But in the target, the nitro is at 5, which would be the case. So option A would give the correct product after step iii. But the question requires all seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is the one that includes acylation, bromination, nitration in the first three steps, and the rest are perhaps irrelevant or incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says it's a high-yield synthesis. If option A's steps iv to vii are necessary, but they alter the product, then option A isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking for the order of substituents.

The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ketone.

So the substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro), with the ketone at 1.

So the correct order is to introduce the substituents in a way that they are meta to each other relative to the acetyl group.

I think the correct sequence is:

1. Acetophenone (acylation).

2. Bromine at 3.

3. Nitro at 5.

So the steps are i, ii, iii in option A.

Therefore, the correct option is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the correct positions relative to the ketone group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5 on the benzene ring. The order of introducing these substituents is critical due to the directing effects of the groups.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with FeBr3 adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - **Step iii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places the substituents at the desired positions. However, steps iv to vii (Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2) are unnecessary and would alter the product, deviating from the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:  
   - **Step i**: Bromination adds bromine at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to bromine).  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the ring is deactivated by the bromine and nitro groups, making this sequence invalid.

3. **Option C**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.  
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would introduce the ketone group, but the amine is an ortho/para director, leading to incorrect positioning of the ketone. This sequence does not yield the desired product.

4. **Option D**:  
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.  
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.  
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization and hydrolysis with H3PO2 convert the amine to a hydroxyl group.  
   - **Step iv**: Bromination would add bromine, but the hydroxyl group is an ortho/para director, leading to incorrect positioning. This sequence does not yield the desired product.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is acylation, bromination, and nitration, as described in **Option A**. While steps iv to vii in Option A are unnecessary and would alter the product, the first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice among the given options.
