Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 value and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, so I might need to handle some unit conversions.

Hmm, okay. Let me outline the key points:

1. Initial nucleus at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, so their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

2. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of M. So, if the initial mass is M, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99M, which is less than M. So, this suggests some mass has been converted into kinetic energy. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so the total energy after fission would be the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies.

3. The fragments' rest masses are in a ratio of 1:2. Let me denote the smaller mass as m; then the larger is 2m. So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So the masses are approximately 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, wait. Because 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M. So the two are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, but the sum is 0.99 M, so the total rest mass is less than the initial. Which makes sense because mass can be converted into kinetic energy, which is where the energy comes from.

Since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think in terms of energy and momentum.

Total initial energy is 300 GeV, all rest mass energy.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies plus the kinetic energies. But the problem specifies that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So, the initial energy is 300 GeV, and the total energy after is (0.99 M * c²) + (K1 + K2). But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy after fission must equal 300 GeV. So:

(0.99 M c²) + (K1 + K2) = M c² * 300 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, no. The rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. The rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M, so their rest mass energy is 0.99 M c². Then, their kinetic energies add to the total energy. The total energy after fission is (0.99 M c²) + K1 + K2, which must equal the initial energy, which is M c² (300 GeV). So:

0.99 M c² + K1 + K2 = M c².

Wait, but wait. Hmm, no. Because in special relativity, energy and momentum are related, but in this case, we're considering the rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy is additional.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering energy and momentum conservation.

Momentum conservation: initial momentum is zero, so the two fragments' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p1 = -p2. Therefore, their magnitudes are equal: |p1|=|p2|=p.

Energy conservation: the initial energy is the rest mass energy, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.

So:

E_initial = E1 + E2,

where E1 = (m1 c²) γ1,

E2 = (m2 c²) γ2.

And:

p1 = γ1 m1 v1,

p2 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since p1 = -p2,

γ1 m1 v1 = - γ2 m2 v2.

But since m1 and m2 are positive, the velocities must be in opposite directions. So, perhaps v2 = - (γ1 m1 / γ2 m2) v1. But this might complicate things. Maybe it's easier to work in terms of momentum and energy.

Alternatively, since the two fragments move with velocities v and u, so that their momenta are equal in magnitude. Let me denote the more massive fragment as fragment 2, so m2 = 2 m1, since m2 is twice m1.

Wait, earlier I said m and 2m add to 3m = 0.99 M → m=0.33 M. So m1 is 0.33 M, m2 is 0.66 M.

So, m1 = 0.33 M, m2 = 0.66 M.

So, for fragment 1: m1 = 0.33 M, fragment 2: m2 = 0.66 M.

So, the momentum p1 of fragment 1 is equal in magnitude to p2 of fragment 2.

p1 = p2 → m1 γ1 v1 = m2 γ2 v2.

But since the direction is opposite, v2 = -v1 in direction, but this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this problem using the center of mass frame, but since the system is initially at rest, that's the frame we're in.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy. But since the problem is about comparing the relativistic and non-relativistic (classical) approaches, perhaps I can think of the kinetic energies in both cases.

Wait, the problem is asking for the difference between T1 (correct, relativistic) and T1_classical, which is the non-relativistic approximation.

So, I'll need to calculate T1 relativistic and T1_classical, then find their difference.

But perhaps first I should find the velocities or the energies.

Let me think about it.

In the rest frame, the total momentum is zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude.

So, p1 = p2.

But since p = γ m v, and the direction is opposite, so p1 = -p2 → p1 = p2 in magnitude.

So, γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since the velocity of fragment 2 is opposite, v2 = -v1 × (some factor), but perhaps it's better to consider the magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps it's more manageable to write in terms of magnitude, so |p1| = |p2| → γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, perhaps v2 is related to v1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express v2 in terms of v1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model this problem using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the speed of fragment 1 as v, and fragment 2 as u. So, their momenta are p1 = γ1 m1 v and p2 = γ2 m2 u. But since p1 + p2 = 0 → p1 = -p2. So, the magnitudes are equal: γ1 m1 v = γ2 m2 u.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, perhaps u = -v × (something). But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can treat the magnitudes.

Wait, but maybe I can proceed by noting that the kinetic energy of each fragment is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So,

K1 = (γ1 - 1) m1 c²,

K2 = (γ2 - 1) m2 c².

But the sum of K1 and K2 is the total kinetic energy released in the fission.

Wait, but the initial energy is all rest mass energy, which is 300 GeV. The final energy is sum of rest energies plus kinetic energies.

So,

300 GeV = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2).

Which rearranges to:

K1 + K2 = 300 GeV - (m1 + m2) c².

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so:

K1 + K2 = 300 GeV - 0.99 M c².

Wait, but the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV, which is M c² = 300 GeV → M = 300 GeV / c².

So, 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, K1 + K2 = 300 - 297 = 3 GeV.

So, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

Hmm, that's a significant amount.

Now, the problem states that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. So, T1 is K2.

So, I need to find K2 = T1.

But how?

Well, since the two fragments have masses m1 = 0.33 M and m2 = 0.66 M, and their momenta are equal in magnitude, their velocities and gamma factors are related by p1 = p2:

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But this seems a bit complex. Perhaps I can find the velocities or gamma factors in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using the fact that the system is at rest, so the total momentum is zero.

So,

p1 = p2.

But p = γ m v.

So, for fragment 1:

p1 = γ1 m1 v1,

for fragment 2:

p2 = γ2 m2 v2.

But momentum vectors are opposite, so p1 = - p2 → their magnitudes are equal:

γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

But since the motion is in opposite directions, perhaps v2 = - (v1) * (γ1 m1)/(γ2 m2).

But I'm not sure about that, perhaps I should think in terms of magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the velocities as proportional to the momentum, but scaled by their masses and gamma factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that for a given momentum p, the velocity v is p/(γ m). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the masses are in a ratio 1:2, which could simplify things.

Let me denote m1 = m, m2 = 2m. So, m = 0.33 M, 2m = 0.66 M. But maybe working with m would be easier.

So, m1 = m, m2 = 2m.

So, from momentum conservation:

p1 = p2 → γ1 m v1 = γ2 (2m) v2.

Simplify:

γ1 v1 = 2 γ2 v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities and gamma factors.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the kinetic energies in terms of their gamma factors.

K1 = (γ1 - 1) m c²,

K2 = (γ2 - 1) (2m) c².

And we know that K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But I also have the momentum conservation equation:

γ1 m v1 = γ2 (2m) v2 → γ1 v1 = 2 γ2 v2.

Hmm. But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, another approach: in terms of energy and momentum, for each fragment.

Each fragment's energy is E = γ m c²,

and its momentum is p = γ m v.

So, for fragment 1, E1 = γ1 m c²,

p1 = γ1 m v1.

Similarly for fragment 2,

E2 = γ2 (2m) c²,

p2 = γ2 (2m) v2.

But from momentum conservation:

p1 = p2 → γ1 m v1 = γ2 (2m) v2 → γ1 v1 = 2 γ2 v2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2 in vector terms. So, their magnitudes are equal.

So, |p1| = |p2| → γ1 m v1 = γ2 (2m) v2.

But v1 and v2 are in opposite directions, so perhaps v2 = - (v1) * (gamma1 m)/(gamma2 * 2m) ), but this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the velocities in terms of beta (β = v/c), so v = β c.

So, for fragment 1:

p1 = γ1 m β c,

for fragment 2:

p2 = γ2 (2m) β2 c.

But p1 = p2 → γ1 m β1 = γ2 (2m) β2.

Simplify: γ1 β1 = 2 γ2 β2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I can express beta in terms of gamma.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c^2.

Wait, but perhaps I can assume that the velocities are not too high, making the non-relativistic approximation somewhat acceptable, but given that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 3e9 eV, and the rest mass energies are in the GeV range (the fragments have rest mass energies 0.33 * 300 GeV =99 GeV and 198 GeV, respectively). So, the kinetic energies (3 GeV) are much smaller than the rest mass energies. So, perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not too bad, but the difference between the relativistic and classical approaches is what we're after.

Wait, but in the problem, the correct T1 is relativistic, and the classical would be using non-relativistic expressions, so we have to compute both and find the difference.

Wait, but maybe in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

But perhaps for the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy, so relativistic effects are minimal. But in this case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and rest mass energies are 99 GeV and 198 GeV, so 3 GeV is about 3% of 100 GeV, so perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is not too bad, but the problem is about the exact difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that T1 is the relativistic kinetic energy, and T1_classical is (1/2) m2 v^2, but using v from the classical approximation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical T1, then subtract them.

Let me think about how to compute T1 correctly.

Since the system is symmetric in momentum, perhaps I can model this using energy and momentum conservation.

We have:

p1 = p2,

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

E1 = gamma1 m1 c^2,

E2 = gamma2 m2 c^2,

and p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 = p,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2 = p.

But because the velocities are in opposite directions, v1 = - (gamma1 m1 v1) / (gamma2 m2) ) → Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the velocities are in opposite directions, so if fragment 1 is moving with velocity v, fragment 2 is moving with velocity -u, where u is another velocity.

Wait, perhaps I can express the momentum in terms of their velocities and masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the invariant mass relation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I can take a different approach. Let me consider the total energy and momentum.

The initial energy is all rest mass energy: E_initial = M c^2 = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

The total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2.

E1^2 = (p1 c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2,

E2^2 = (p2 c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.

Since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal: p1 = p, p2 = p.

So,

E1^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m1 c^2)^2,

E2^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.

Also, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Let me write E1 = A, E2 = B.

So, A + B = 300 GeV.

And,

A^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m1 c^2)^2,

B^2 = p^2 c^2 + (m2 c^2)^2.

Subtracting the two equations,

A^2 - B^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Which can be written as (A - B)(A + B) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

But since A + B = 300 GeV, then,

(A - B) * 300 GeV = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

We can compute m1 and m2.

Earlier, m1 = 0.33 M, m2 = 0.66 M.

But M is the initial mass, whose rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So, M c^2 = 300 GeV.

So, m1 c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV,

m2 c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So,

m1^2 c^4 = (99 GeV)^2,

m2^2 c^4 = (198 GeV)^2.

So, m1^2 c^4 - m2^2 c^4 = (99^2 - 198^2) (GeV)^2.

Hmm, but wait, 198 is 2 *99. So,

99^2 - (2*99)^2 = 99^2 (1 - 4) )= 99^2 (-3) = -3 * 99^2.

So,

m1^2 c^4 - m2^2 c^4 = -3 * (99)^2 (GeV)^2.

Putting into the equation:

(A - B) * 300 GeV = (-3 * 99^2 GeV^2 ) / c^4 * c^4? Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, the expression is (m1^2 c^4 - m2^2 c^4) = (m1 c^2)^2 - (m2 c^2)^2.

Which is 99^2 GeV^2 - 198^2 GeV^2.

Which is (99 - 198)(99 + 198) GeV^2 → (-99)(297) GeV^2 → -29, 793 GeV^2.

So,

(A - B) * 300 GeV = (-29,793 GeV^2).

So,

A - B = (-29,793 GeV^2) / (300 GeV) )= -99.31 GeV.

So,

A - B = -99.31 GeV.

And we already know that A + B = 300 GeV.

So,

We have two equations:

A + B = 300,

A - B = -99.31.

Adding them,

2A = 200.69 → A = 100.345 GeV.

Subtracting,

2B = 399.31 → B = 199.655 GeV.

So,

E1 = A = 100.345 GeV,

E2 = B = 199.655 GeV.

So, E1 is the energy of the lighter fragment, E2 is the energy of the heavier fragment.

Now, the kinetic energy of fragment 2 is T1 = E2 - m2 c^2.

m2 c^2 =198 GeV. So,

T1 = 199.655 GeV -198 GeV = 1.655 GeV.

So, T1 is approximately 1.655 GeV.

Wait, but the problem says that the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. So, their rest masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M, adding to 0.99 M, which is correct.

So, the correct T1 is 1.655 GeV.

Now, what's the classical approximation?

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

But in the classical approach, we'd model momentum conservation and kinetic energy.

Let me try to compute T1_classical.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

So, for fragment 2, T1_classical = (1/2) m2 v2^2.

But we need to find v2.

Momentum conservation: p1 = p2.

p1 = m1 v1,

p2 = m2 v2.

So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v1 = (m2 v2)/m1.

But since m2 = 2 m1,

v1 = (2 m1 v2) / m1 = 2 v2.

So, v1 = 2 v2.

Now, the kinetic energies are:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2^2.

But K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Substituting,

(1/2) m1 (2 v2)^2 + (1/2) m2 v2^2 = 3 GeV.

Simplify:

(1/2) m1 (4 v2^2) + (1/2) (2 m1) v2^2 =3 GeV.

Because m2 = 2 m1.

So,

(2 m1 v2^2) + (m1 v2^2) ) =3 GeV.

So,

3 m1 v2^2 =3 GeV → m1 v2^2 =1 GeV.

But m1 is 0.33 M, which is 0.33 * (300 GeV /c² ) → but in non-relativistic terms, m1 c^2 is 99 GeV (since M c^2 =300 GeV).

Wait, m1 c^2 =99 GeV → m1 =99 GeV/(c²).

But in non-relativistic, v is in terms of c, so maybe we can compute v2^2.

Wait, m1 v2^2 =1 GeV.

But m1 is in kg, but perhaps it's easier to express in terms of GeV and c.

Wait, let's compute m1 v2^2 =1 GeV.

Expressed in terms of m1 =0.33 M, and M c^2= 300 GeV,

m1 = (0.33 M) = 0.33 * (300 GeV/c²) ) → m1 = 99 GeV / c².

So,

m1 v2^2 = (99 GeV/c²) * (v2^2) =1 GeV.

So,

v2^2 = (1 GeV) * c² / (99 GeV) )= c²/99.

So,

v2 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c * 0.1005.

So, v2 ≈0.1005 c.

Then, T1_classical = (1/2) m2 v2^2.

m2 =2 m1 = 2 *99 GeV/c² =198 GeV/c².

So,

T1_classical =0.5 * 198 GeV/c² * (c² /99) )

Simplify:

0.5 * 198 * (c²)/c² * (1/99) )

The c² cancels out:

0.5 * 198 /99 =0.5 * 2 =1 GeV.

So, T1_classical is 1 GeV.

Earlier, the correct T1 is about 1.655 GeV.

So, the difference is 1.655 GeV - 1 GeV =0.655 GeV, which is 655 MeV.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the correct T1. Earlier, I had E2 =199.655 GeV, and m2 c^2=198 GeV, so T1 =1.655 GeV.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV.

So, the difference would be 0.655 GeV, which is 655 MeV. But the options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20 MeV.

Hmm, that's way off from the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E1 and E2. Let me recheck that.

Let me go back to the equations:

A + B =300 GeV,

(A^2 - B^2) = (m1^2 c^4 - m2^2 c^4).

Which I calculated as (99^2 -198^2) GeV^2.

Wait, 99^2 is 9801, 198^2 is 39204.

So,

99^2 GeV^2 -198^2 GeV^2 = (9801 -39204) GeV^2 = -29403 GeV^2.

So,

(A - B) * (A + B) = -29403 GeV^2.

But A + B =300 GeV,

So,

(A - B) *300 GeV =-29403 GeV^2 → A - B= -29403 /300 →-98.01 GeV.

So,

A - B= -98.01 GeV.

And,

A + B=300 GeV.

So,

Adding the two equations:

2A=201.99 →A=100.995 GeV.

Subtracting:

2B=300 +98.01 →398.01 → B=199.005 GeV.

So,

E1= A=100.995 GeV,

E2= B=199.005 GeV.

So,

T1= E2 - m2 c^2=199.005 GeV - 198 GeV=1.005 GeV.

So, the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV.

In the classical approximation, T1_classical is 1.0 GeV.

So, the difference is 1.005 -1.0 =0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

Ah, now the difference is 5 MeV, which matches option B.

So, the correct answer is B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using relativistic and classical mechanics to determine the difference between the correct kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and its classical approximation.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The atomic nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - After fission, the two fragments have rest masses in a \( 1:2 \) ratio, and their combined rest mass is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass \( M \).  
   - The more massive fragment has rest mass \( m_2 = 0.66M \), and the lighter fragment has \( m_1 = 0.33M \).

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after fission is conserved. Initially, the energy is purely rest mass energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]  
   After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_1 + E_2,
   \]  
   where \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \). The total kinetic energy released is:  
   \[
   K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

3. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the two fragments are equal:  
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2.
   \]

### Relativistic Calculation:
Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \), we solve for the energies of the two fragments. Let \( E_1 = A \) and \( E_2 = B \). From energy conservation:  
\[
A + B = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
From the momentum conservation condition and the rest mass energies, we also have:  
\[
A^2 - B^2 = (m_1^2 - m_2^2) c^4.
\]  
Substituting \( m_1 c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2 c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \):  
\[
A^2 - B^2 = (99^2 - 198^2) \, \text{GeV}^2 = -29,403 \, \text{GeV}^2.
\]  
Using \( A + B = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), we solve for \( A \) and \( B \):  
\[
(A - B)(300) = -29,403 \implies A - B = -98.01 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
Adding and subtracting the equations \( A + B = 300 \) and \( A - B = -98.01 \):  
\[
A = 100.995 \, \text{GeV}, \quad B = 199.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
T_1 = E_2 - m_2 c^2 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV} - 198 \, \text{GeV} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Classical Approximation:
In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using momentum conservation, \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), and substituting \( m_2 = 2m_1 \), we find \( v_1 = 2v_2 \). The total kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_1 + K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
Substituting \( m_1 = 0.33M \) and \( m_2 = 0.66M \), we solve for \( v_2 \):  
\[
\frac{1}{2} m_1 (2v_2)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 3 \implies 3m_1 v_2^2 = 3 \implies m_1 v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]  
The classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:  
\[
T_1^{\text{classical}} = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values:
The difference is:  
\[
T_1 - T_1^{\text{classical}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and its classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
