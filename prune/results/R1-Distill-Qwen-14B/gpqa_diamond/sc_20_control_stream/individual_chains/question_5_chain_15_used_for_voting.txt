Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The operator is denoted as P, and I'm supposed to find its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator components are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like position or momentum are often represented as matrices. So, the operator P itself is a vector operator, which can be written as P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat, where x_hat, y_hat, z_hat are the unit vectors. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must be a linear combination of x and z components.

So, the direction vector n can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So θ is the angle made with the z-axis, I think.

Now, the operator P along direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P and the unit vector n. So,

P_n = P · n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Because the y-component of n is zero, P_y doesn't contribute here. That's because n is in the x-z plane, so only x and z directions matter.

Okay, so first, I need to write out the matrices for each component.

Given:
P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's see:

The first term, sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]], gives a matrix with 0s on the diagonal and sinθ on the off-diagonal.

The second term, cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]], gives a diagonal matrix with cosθ and -cosθ.

So adding those together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the eigenvector equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Let me write |ψ> as a two-component vector (a, b)^T.

So, P_n applied to |ψ> is (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by [a; b].

So, the product is:

First component: (cosθ * a) + (sinθ * b)
Second component: (sinθ * a) + (-cosθ * b)

Multiply each by (ħ/2), so the result is:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ a + sinθ b), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ]

Set this equal to (ħ/2) times [a; b], because the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So, (ħ/2) [ (cosθ a + sinθ b), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to get:

[ cosθ a + sinθ b ] = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

So now we have two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
a sinθ + b ( -cosθ - 1 ) = 0

Hmm, so I have two equations:

Equation 1: a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0
Equation 2: a sinθ + b ( - cosθ -1 ) = 0

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between a and b from these equations.

Let me write equation 1 as:

a (cosθ -1) = -b sinθ
=> a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1 )

But cosθ -1 is -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So perhaps I can simplify this.

Alternatively, let's see. Let me factor equation 1 and equation 2.

Wait, perhaps I can write equation 1 and 2 as a system of linear equations:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ         ] [a]   = [0]
[   sinθ     (-cosθ -1)    ] [b]     [0]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix is:

D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Let's compute D.

= [ (-cosθ -1)(cosθ -1) ) ] - sin²θ

Multiply out the first part:

(-cosθ)(cosθ) + (-cosθ)(-1) + (-1)(cosθ) + (-1)(-1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ + 1
= -cos²θ + 0 + 1
= 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ

So D = [ (1 - cos²θ) ] - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the first term was (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = ( - (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) ) = -(cos²θ -1) = -( -sin²θ ) = sin²θ. So D is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So determinant is zero, which implies the system has non-trivial solutions, which makes sense because we are looking for eigenvectors.

So, the system has non-trivial solutions, so the equations are dependent.

Let me take equation 1:

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0

I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1):

a = [ -b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ) ]
Denominator is cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( - sin²θ )
= [ b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( sin²θ )
= b (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Wait, let me see:

Wait, denominator: (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( - sin²θ / (cosθ +1) ) ) ??? Hmm, perhaps I should approach differently.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parametrize one variable. Let me set b = 1, then find a.

So, from equation 1:

a (cosθ -1) + 1 * sinθ = 0

So a = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

a = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]
= [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

Simplify:

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels.

= [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin^2(theta/2) ) ]
= cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)
= cot(theta/2)

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

Wait, but I set b=1, so a = cot(theta/2)

So, our vector is [a, b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]

But wait, let me check with equation 2.

Equation 2: a sinθ + b ( -cosθ -1 ) = 0

If I plug a = cot(theta/2), b=1:

Left side: cot(theta/2) sinθ + ( -cosθ -1 )

Compute cot(theta/2) * sinθ.

Cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So,

= [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sinθ

But sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

= [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
= 2 cos^2(theta/2)

So, left side becomes:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - cosθ -1

Wait, what's cosθ in terms of theta/2?

cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1

So, substituting:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - [2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ] -1 

= 2 cos^2(theta/2) -2 cos^2(theta/2) +1 -1 

= 0 

So, equation 2 is satisfied. So yes, a = cot(theta/2), b=1 is a solution.

Wait, but the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So, the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to find the normalized eigenvector, we need to normalize this vector.

So, the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

Let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is a^2 + b^2 = [ cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ]

But cot^2 +1 = csc^2, so this is 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

So, norm = 1 / | sin(theta/2) | 

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, no: if the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ], and the norm is 1 / sin(theta/2 ), then the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Because when you multiply by the norm, which is sin(theta/2), you get [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so multiplying by sin(theta/2) gives cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Original vector: [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

The norm squared is (cot^2 +1 ) = csc^2(theta/2 ) = 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

Norm is 1/|sin(theta/2)|, so to normalize, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So, [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2 )

So,

= [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ]

= [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have here. But wait, looking back, the options are given as options, each as the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but wait, I had the operator P_n being (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ). So, perhaps I should have considered the direction vector n as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), which is correct.

Wait, but when I computed, the eigenvector came out as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but that's the same as a spin-up state in the z-direction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the operator.

Wait, no, because the operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, perhaps the eigenvectors relate to the spin state along that direction.

Wait, but the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is typically written as:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. Wait, no, direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0 or pi, depending on the direction.

Wait, but earlier calculation led me to the normalized eigenvector being [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is the same as option C.

Wait, but option D is [ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, where does the sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) come from? Oh, perhaps the eigenvector isn't just the normalized [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], but maybe I missed some scaling factor.

Wait, looking back: the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, the operator in the problem is P, which has components multiplied by ħ/2. But the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the elements are just the components, without any ħ.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ))

Yes.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

In the normalized eigenvector, I found [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Looking at option C, it's exactly that. So that's the answer.

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P, which I think is actually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Because P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z. So the operator P along direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0.

So, P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

Which gives the matrix as (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Which is what I used earlier.

So, the eigenvalue equation is [ (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Which simplifies to [ (cosθ a + sinθ b ), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = [a; b ]

Which gives the same equations as before.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P_n = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector equation is:

\[
P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P_n$ into the equation, we solve the system:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the equations become:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0.
\]

Similarly, rearranging the second equation:

\[
a \sin\theta + b (-\cos\theta - 1) = 0.
\]

These equations are linearly dependent, and solving for $a$ and $b$ gives the eigenvector proportional to:

\[
| \psi \rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$**

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The operator is denoted as P, and I'm supposed to find its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator components are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like position or momentum are often represented as matrices. So, the operator P itself is a vector operator, which can be written as P = P_x x_hat + P_y y_hat + P_z z_hat, where x_hat, y_hat, z_hat are the unit vectors. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must be a linear combination of x and z components.

So, the direction vector n can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So θ is the angle made with the z-axis, I think.

Now, the operator P along direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P and the unit vector n. So,

P_n = P · n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Because the y-component of n is zero, P_y doesn't contribute here. That's because n is in the x-z plane, so only x and z directions matter.

Okay, so first, I need to write out the matrices for each component.

Given:
P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's see:

The first term, sinθ times [[0,1],[1,0]], gives a matrix with 0s on the diagonal and sinθ on the off-diagonal.

The second term, cosθ times [[1,0],[0,-1]], gives a diagonal matrix with cosθ and -cosθ.

So adding those together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the eigenvector equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, the equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Let me write |ψ> as a two-component vector (a, b)^T.

So, P_n applied to |ψ> is (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by [a; b].

So, the product is:

First component: (cosθ * a) + (sinθ * b)
Second component: (sinθ * a) + (-cosθ * b)

Multiply each by (ħ/2), so the result is:

(ħ/2) [ (cosθ a + sinθ b), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ]

Set this equal to (ħ/2) times [a; b], because the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So, (ħ/2) [ (cosθ a + sinθ b), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to get:

[ cosθ a + sinθ b ] = a
sinθ a - cosθ b = b

So now we have two equations:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
a sinθ + b ( -cosθ - 1 ) = 0

Hmm, so I have two equations:

Equation 1: a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0
Equation 2: a sinθ + b ( - cosθ -1 ) = 0

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between a and b from these equations.

Let me write equation 1 as:

a (cosθ -1) = -b sinθ
=> a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1 )

But cosθ -1 is -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So perhaps I can simplify this.

Alternatively, let's see. Let me factor equation 1 and equation 2.

Wait, perhaps I can write equation 1 and 2 as a system of linear equations:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ         ] [a]   = [0]
[   sinθ     (-cosθ -1)    ] [b]     [0]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix is:

D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Let's compute D.

= [ (-cosθ -1)(cosθ -1) ) ] - sin²θ

Multiply out the first part:

(-cosθ)(cosθ) + (-cosθ)(-1) + (-1)(cosθ) + (-1)(-1)
= -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ + 1
= -cos²θ + 0 + 1
= 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ

So D = [ (1 - cos²θ) ] - sin²θ = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the first term was (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = ( - (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) ) = -(cos²θ -1) = -( -sin²θ ) = sin²θ. So D is sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So determinant is zero, which implies the system has non-trivial solutions, which makes sense because we are looking for eigenvectors.

So, the system has non-trivial solutions, so the equations are dependent.

Let me take equation 1:

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0

I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me express a in terms of b.

a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by (cosθ +1):

a = [ -b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / [ (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) ) ]
Denominator is cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( - sin²θ )
= [ b sinθ (cosθ +1) ] / ( sin²θ )
= b (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Wait, let me see:

Wait, denominator: (cosθ -1)(cosθ +1) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( - sin²θ / (cosθ +1) ) ) ??? Hmm, perhaps I should approach differently.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parametrize one variable. Let me set b = 1, then find a.

So, from equation 1:

a (cosθ -1) + 1 * sinθ = 0

So a = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

But cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So,

a = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]
= [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

Simplify:

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels.

= [ sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin^2(theta/2) ) ]
= cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2)
= cot(theta/2)

So, a = cot(theta/2) * b

Wait, but I set b=1, so a = cot(theta/2)

So, our vector is [a, b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]

But wait, let me check with equation 2.

Equation 2: a sinθ + b ( -cosθ -1 ) = 0

If I plug a = cot(theta/2), b=1:

Left side: cot(theta/2) sinθ + ( -cosθ -1 )

Compute cot(theta/2) * sinθ.

Cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)

So,

= [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sinθ

But sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

= [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)
= 2 cos^2(theta/2)

So, left side becomes:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - cosθ -1

Wait, what's cosθ in terms of theta/2?

cosθ = 2 cos^2(theta/2) -1

So, substituting:

2 cos^2(theta/2) - [2 cos^2(theta/2) -1 ] -1 

= 2 cos^2(theta/2) -2 cos^2(theta/2) +1 -1 

= 0 

So, equation 2 is satisfied. So yes, a = cot(theta/2), b=1 is a solution.

Wait, but the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So, the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

But to find the normalized eigenvector, we need to normalize this vector.

So, the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

Let me compute the normalization factor.

The norm squared is a^2 + b^2 = [ cot^2(theta/2) + 1 ]

But cot^2 +1 = csc^2, so this is 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

So, norm = 1 / | sin(theta/2) | 

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, no: if the vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ], and the norm is 1 / sin(theta/2 ), then the normalized vector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ].

Because when you multiply by the norm, which is sin(theta/2), you get [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Simplify:

cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so multiplying by sin(theta/2) gives cos(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Original vector: [ a, b ] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

The norm squared is (cot^2 +1 ) = csc^2(theta/2 ) = 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

Norm is 1/|sin(theta/2)|, so to normalize, each component is multiplied by sin(theta/2).

So, [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ]

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2 )

So,

= [ cos(theta/2)/ sin(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ]

= [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

So, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have here. But wait, looking back, the options are given as options, each as the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Wait, but wait, I had the operator P_n being (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ). So, perhaps I should have considered the direction vector n as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), which is correct.

Wait, but when I computed, the eigenvector came out as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, but that's the same as a spin-up state in the z-direction. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the operator.

Wait, no, because the operator P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So, perhaps the eigenvectors relate to the spin state along that direction.

Wait, but the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction (theta, phi) is typically written as:

[ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is the angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. Wait, no, direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0 or pi, depending on the direction.

Wait, but earlier calculation led me to the normalized eigenvector being [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Which is the same as option C.

Wait, but option D is [ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, where does the sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) come from? Oh, perhaps the eigenvector isn't just the normalized [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], but maybe I missed some scaling factor.

Wait, looking back: the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, the operator in the problem is P, which has components multiplied by ħ/2. But the eigenvector is a unit vector, so the elements are just the components, without any ħ.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option C) (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ))

Yes.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

In the normalized eigenvector, I found [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Looking at option C, it's exactly that. So that's the answer.

But wait, in the problem statement, the operator is P, which I think is actually the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Because P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, P_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z. So the operator P along direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

Since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0.

So, P_n = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So, P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ]

Which gives the matrix as (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Which is what I used earlier.

So, the eigenvalue equation is [ (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Which simplifies to [ (cosθ a + sinθ b ), (sinθ a - cosθ b) ] = [a; b ]

Which gives the same equations as before.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
P_n = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvector equation is:

\[
P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

where $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P_n$ into the equation, we solve the system:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the equations become:

\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b.
\]

Rearranging the first equation:

\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0.
\]

Similarly, rearranging the second equation:

\[
a \sin\theta + b (-\cos\theta - 1) = 0.
\]

These equations are linearly dependent, and solving for $a$ and $b$ gives the eigenvector proportional to:

\[
| \psi \rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the norm:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$**

Answer: C
