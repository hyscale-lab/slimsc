Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I need to figure out what E looks like.

First, let's parse the reactions. 

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, that's a lot of equivalents, so maybe B is a diatomic gas. 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles reacting with 1 mole of A. Maybe A is something like sulfur because sulfur forms some compounds with high ratios.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps A is an element that forms a compound with B in an 8:1 ratio. Let me think. Oh, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2), but 8 equivalents of Cl2 with Na? That would form NaCl, but that's a 2:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit. Hmm. Or perhaps A is Fe and B is something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with oxygen. Wait, sulfur (S) can react with oxygen (O2) in such a way. For example, S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But 8 equivalents would imply a higher ratio. Maybe 4 O2 per S? Not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like I2 (iodine), which is a bright red vapor, but that's when it's a gas. Or maybe it's a compound. Oh, wait, another possibility is that C is a metal sulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like FeO or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is an alkali metal, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's move to the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C is treated with water, it produces A and two acids. 

Hmm, that makes me think of a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide (but wait, metal oxides are usually basic, not acidic unless they're transition metals). Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed forms a metal hydroxide and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, but in that case, F and G would be H2S and maybe another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate. Let's think. Suppose A is a metal, like sodium (Na). If A is Na, and B is O2, maybe they form NaO2? But wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, but then the reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B. So 1 A reacting with 8 B molecules. If B is O2, then 8 O2 would mean 16 O atoms. So A would need to combine with 16 O. That might be something like PbO2, but Pb is lead, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2. So solid A reacts with 8 Cl2 molecules. That would make a compound like ACl8. What metals form such high chlorides? Hmm, maybe it's iron (Fe), but FeCl8? I think iron usually forms FeCl2, FeCl3, maybe higher chlorides but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state.

Wait, but product C is bright red, which might suggest something else. Let me think about reactions that form red products.

Wait, another angle: The reaction where C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio. What if D is a gas like Cl2? Then, when C reacts with Cl2, perhaps in a substitution reaction. But product E is extremely hazardous, so maybe E is something like phosgene (which is Cl2C=O, but I'm not sure if that's the case here).

Alternatively, when C reacts with D, maybe it's adding across a double bond or something similar.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. If C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a colorless gas, but not red. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, but when sulfides react with water, they usually form H2S and a metal hydroxide, but H2S is a weak acid, so maybe that fits.

Wait, but the first reaction produces C when A reacts with B (gas). Let me think about a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas to form a red product. Oh! Maybe it's the formation of SO3? No, that's not red. Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is O2. Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, which is a solid. But 8 equivalents of O2 would be 8 moles of O2 per mole of Na. So 8 * (O2) → 16 O atoms. So Na would react with 16 O to form NaO8? Not sure if that's a real compound.

Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus (P), and B is O2. So P reacts with O2 to form P4O10, which is white, though. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's move to the reaction where C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. Suppose C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, say, MO, then reacting with water would form M(OH) and possibly H2O. Hmm, but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a higher oxide, like M2O7, which upon hydrolysis could produce H2M2O7 or something else. Wait, perhaps more clues: F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. That suggests that the oxide might be a mixed oxide or something that, upon hydrolysis, produces two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfide, like FeS. Reacting FeS with water wouldn't produce much, but maybe if it's a more complex sulfide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is AlN, which upon hydrolysis gives NH3 and Al(OH)3, but NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a carbide? Like SiC. Reacting with water produces SiO2 (a weak acid, maybe? Well, it's a solid, so not sure) and CH4, which is a neutral gas. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of some sort. Wait, but if C is a salt, reacting with water wouldn't produce two different acids. Unless it's a double salt or something.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say C is ZnSO4. If ZnSO4 reacts with water, it just stays as ZnSO4·nH2O, which doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Reaction of C with D gives E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be a highly toxic gas. For example, something like HCl, but that's not likely. Alternatively, phosgene (Cl2CO), but that's a gas. Or maybe sarin gas? No, that's an organophosphorus compound.

Wait, perhaps E is Cl2O7, which is chlorine pentaoxide or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but that's a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2. Then, C reacts with O2 to form E. But I'm not sure what E would be.

Wait, another thought: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So B and D react to form H. Let me think about common solvents. For instance, if B is Cl2 and D is another halogen, say F2, but H would be... no, perhaps B is H2 and D is something else. Alternatively, if B is CO2 and D is H2O, they can form H2CO3, but that's not a common solvent. Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. That could fit.

Wait, but then in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a metal that forms an oxide with 8 O atoms. For example, if A is Fe, FeO would be Fe:O ratio 1:1, but I need 8 O atoms per A. Wait, perhaps A is something like Fe, and the oxide is FeO4^4- or something, but I don't think such an oxide exists. Alternatively, maybe A is Pb and forms PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), which has a formula of PbO2. So 1 Pb per 2 O, but that's not 8 O. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is chromium. Chromium can form CrO3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. CrO3 has formula CrO3, so 3 O per Cr. But in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B (O2) would mean 8 O2 molecules, which is 16 O atoms. So if A is Cr, then Cr reacts with 16 O atoms. Let me see: Cr + O2 → CrO4^2- or something. Wait, CrO3 is a solid. So perhaps CrO3 is formed. But how many O2 molecules would that take?

CrO3 has formula CrO3, which is Cr:O ratio of 1:3. O2 is O2, so each molecule has 2 O atoms. So to make CrO3, the reaction would be 2 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 CrO3. So for each Cr, 3 O2 are needed. So 8 equivalents of O2 per Cr would make a different compound. Hmm, perhaps 8 O2 is 16 O atoms. So per mole of A, 16 O atoms. So maybe CrO4^2- or something else.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me see if I can think of another approach.

Wait, the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If D is O2, then C could be something that reacts with O2 under certain conditions. Alternatively, if D is F2, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The product when C reacts with water is A plus two acids. So, let's assume C is a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases A and produces two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that contains the cation of A and some anions that become the acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, and when it reacts with water, it produces Fe(OH)2 (which isn't particularly an acid) and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So F and G would be H2S (weak acid) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure where the other acid would come from. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and C is NaNO3. Then, when NaNO3 reacts with water, it just stays as NaNO3; it doesn't produce acids. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait another thought: C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and another acid. Hmm, but most metal oxides are either basic or neutral. Unless it's a transition metal oxide that's amphoteric.

For example, if C is Al2O3, which is amphoteric. So Al2O3 + H2O → Al(OH)3 and perhaps some H+ (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that would react with water to form CO2 and the metal hydroxide, but CO2 is a weak acid.

Wait, but the problem states that when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids F and G. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases A and produces two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something similar. Let's think: For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water might not produce much. But maybe under acidic conditions, it could decompose. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the last reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So, possible reactions: H could be a solvent like H2O or something else.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O), so that's 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. So perhaps B is O2 and D is another O-based gas. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is O2. They don't react in a 1:1 ratio, or at least not to form a common solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl (which is a gas, but HCl is a strong acid, not a solvent). Hmm, but HCl is a liquid when concentrated, but I'm not sure if that's considered a solvent in this context.

Wait, another common solvent is ethanol or something, but how would B and D, which are gases, react to form that? Maybe B is CO2 and D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B and D are both diatomic gases that combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a liquid. For example, H2 and F2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form HF, which is a liquid (well, at room temperature, it's a liquid but can be a gas when heated). HF is a solvent, so H could be HF.

Wait, that's an interesting thought. So if B is H2 and D is F2, then H would be HF. But let's see if that fits the other reactions.

So, B is H2, D is F2. Then, H is HF.

In the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). Hmm, A reacting with H2 in large amounts. Maybe A is a metal, and the reaction is a hydrogenation. For example, if A is a transition metal like Fe, and it reacts with H2 to form FeH2? But I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps A is a metal that forms a hydride. But I'm not sure how that would relate to the color.

Wait, another possibility: A is an element that forms a compound with H2 in an 8:1 ratio. Let's say A is carbon (C). Then 8 H2 would give 16 H atoms. So C + 8 H2 → CH16? I don't think that's a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is nitrogen. N2 + 8 H2 → NH16? Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S). S + 8 H2 → S H16? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where hydrogen adds to a metal in a high ratio. I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Alternatively, maybe B is not H2 but something else. Let's try another approach.

If H is HF, then D is F2 and B is H2. Then, in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 H2 to form C, which is bright red. So maybe C is FeH (iron hydride), but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound of A with H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and when it reacts with H2, it forms a metal hydride. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, perhaps C is Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is black, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is CuO, which is black. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If A is sodium (Na), and B is O2, then Na reacts with O2 to form NaO2 (sodium peroxide), which is a pale yellow solid. But the product C is bright red, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of vanadium or another transition metal that has a red color. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not red. Maybe it's another oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of chromium. Chromium(VI) compounds can be orange or yellow. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction where C and D form E. If D is F2, then C reacts with F2 to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So, for example, if C is a metal, then E would be the metal fluoride. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3 or something like that, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but E is formed when C reacts with D (F2). So C + F2 → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is ClF3, which is a highly toxic gas. But I'm not sure how that connects.

Let me try to think about the structure of E. The question is about its molecular symmetry group. Common symmetry groups for molecules: 

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: a high symmetry group, like in square planar or octahedral complexes.
- D∞h: an infinite symmetry group, like in a linear molecule with a center of inversion and perpendicular planes of symmetry.
- C2v: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a C2 axis and some mirror planes, it might be C2v.

But to determine that, I need to know what E is. So perhaps I should figure out what E is.

Let me go back. Let's recap what I know:

1. Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).
2. Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).
3. Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
4. Reaction 4: B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

Let me consider possible candidates for H, the solvent. H is formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio.

If H is H2O, then B and D must combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. So, possible reactions:

B and D could be H2 and O2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O), so that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, B and D could be O2 and another diatomic gas that reacts 1:1 to form H2O. But I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is F2. Then, H could be O2F2 (dihydrogen monoxide? No, wait, that's H2O. Wait, O2F2 isn't a common solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent, like ethanol, but that would require B and D to react to form ethanol, which seems unlikely given they're gases.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl. HCl is a gas but can be a liquid when concentrated. But is HCl considered a solvent? It's used as a solvent in some reactions, but more commonly, it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps B and D are both H2 and F2, which react in a 1:1 ratio to form 2 HF. But HF is a liquid at room temperature. So H would be HF. That's a solvent. So B is H2, D is F2. Then, H is HF. That seems plausible.

So, B is H2, D is F2. They react to form 2 HF (since 1 H2 + 1 F2 → 2 HF). So that's a 1:1 ratio for B and D to produce H (HF). So that fits.

Now, moving to Reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). So, solid A plus 8 H2 → C.

Possible reaction: A could be a metal that reacts with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Ca reacts with H2 to form CaH2. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another angle: If A is an element that forms a compound with H2 in a high ratio. Let's think about transition metals. For example, if A is Fe, and reacts with H2 (but usually Fe reacts with H2 under certain conditions, like in the Haber process, but that's for NH3). Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's think about nitrogen. N2 can react with H2 in the Haber process to form NH3, but that's 3 H2 per N2. But in this case, it's 8 H2 per A, which is 16 H atoms. So maybe A is C (carbon), and reacts with H2 to form CH16? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex hydride. For example, Na reacts with H2 to form NaH. But 8 H2 would be 16 H atoms, so perhaps NaH is formed. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a compound that is bright red, maybe it's a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright red. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown. Not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe in some other form it's red. Or perhaps C is a chromium compound, like Cr2O3, which is green. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: The product C reacts with water to form A and two acids. If C is a metal oxide, then A would be the metal, and the two acids would be from the hydrolysis. But most metal oxides produce basic solutions. Unless it's an amphoteric oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is Al2O3. Al2O3 reacts with water to form Al(OH)3 and possibly some H+ ions. But Al(OH)3 is amphoteric. But the problem states that two different acids are formed, F and G. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, then reacting with water may not produce much, but under acidic conditions, it could produce H2S (weak acid) and Fe^2+ ions, but Fe^2+ isn't an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is AlN, then AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water to form NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (it's a gas, but in water, it forms H2CO3). So F and G could be H2CO3 and NaOH? But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: When C reacts with water, it produces F and G, which are two different acids. So C must be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases two different acid substances.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. But again, NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but that usually hydrolyzes into the corresponding acid and base. For example, Na2SO4 is neutral.

Wait, perhaps C is a polyprotic acid's anhydride. For example, if C is anhydrous H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but that's a liquid, not a solid. Also, reacting H2SO4 with water wouldn't produce two acids, just the same H2SO4.

Alternatively, think of a compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids. Maybe a mixed anhydride?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For instance, SiC reacts with water to produce CO and SiO2. CO is a neutral gas, and SiO2 is a solid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a salt of two different acids. For example, a salt that has two different anions which, when hydrolyzed, produce two different acids. For example, something like Mg(NH2)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate or something similar. I'm not getting anywhere here, so maybe I should think about the first reaction again.

If in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 H2 to form C, which is bright red. Let's say A is Fe. Fe and H2 under certain conditions form FeH2, which might be black. Not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal, like S. S and H2 can react to form H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps A is O, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a compound with H2 in a high ratio. Let me think about H2 reacting with a metal to form a hydride. For example, NaH is formed from Na and H2. If A is Na, then 8 H2 would be 16 H atoms. So Na + 8 H2 → NaH2? But NaH is NaH, so maybe Na reacts with 2 H2 to form NaH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Al. Al reacts with H2 under certain conditions to form AlH3, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another idea: If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps E is sarin gas, but I'm not sure how that would fit. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (Cl2CO), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like HCN, which is highly toxic. But how would that fit the other reactions?

Wait, so E is formed when C reacts with D (F2). So if C is a metal, then E would be the metal fluoride. For example, Fe reacts with F2 to form FeF2 or FeF3. But would that be extremely hazardous? Maybe in some cases, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reaction where C reacts with F2 to form E. If C is a sulfide, say FeS, then E would be FeF2 and S F2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. If C is FeO, then reacting with F2 would form FeF2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound containing both O and another element. For example, if C is SO3, then reacting with F2 would form SO3F2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that doesn't make sense with F2.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about E's structure. If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group could be D∞h or C2v. If it's a bent molecule, maybe C2v. For example, H2O is V-shaped with C2v symmetry. Similarly, O3 has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a C2 axis, leading to D∞h symmetry.

Wait, if E is CO2, which is linear, its symmetry group is D∞h. But would that fit the reactions?

Let me see: If E is CO2, then D would be a gas that reacts with C to form CO2. But I'm not sure how that fits with the rest.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like F2O, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps E is ClF3. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule with a C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. For example, octahedral molecules have D4h symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The first reaction produces C, which is bright red. Think of a bright red solid or liquid. One possibility is mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Wait, no, mercury(II) oxide is red, but I'm not sure about its state. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, As2S3 is bright red. Or maybe it's a form of lead oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But the problem states that two different acids are formed, so maybe the metal hydroxide is basic, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxide decomposes further, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry would be D∞h (like CO2 or O2). If E is a bent molecule, it could be C2v (like H2O or O3). If E is a molecule with a two-fold axis and some mirror planes, it could be C2v.

But without knowing E's structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the reactions, perhaps E is a linear molecule, making its symmetry group D∞h.

Wait, but earlier I thought perhaps E is ClF3, which is trigonal pyramidal, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2F2, which is linear, then its symmetry group would be D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But given the options, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple planes of symmetry, D∞h is likely.

So, putting it all together, perhaps E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, making the answer option C) D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high ratio of gas B (8 equivalents) suggests B could be a diatomic gas like O₂ or H₂. The bright red color of C hints at compounds like certain metal oxides, sulfides, or other red-colored materials. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic gas or compound. Possible candidates include phosgene (Cl₂CO), sarin gas, or other toxic substances. However, the exact identity of E is not confirmed.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes to release A and two acids. For example, if C were a sulfide, it might produce H₂S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. However, the exact nature of C and A is still ambiguous.

4. **Reaction 4**: Gas B reacts with gas D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. If B is H₂ and D is F₂, their reaction could form HF, a liquid solvent. This aligns with the 1:1 ratio and the formation of a solvent.

Given the symmetry options:
- **C2**: A molecule with a two-fold rotation axis.
- **D4h**: A high-symmetry group, common in square planar or octahedral complexes.
- **D∞h**: A symmetry group for linear molecules with a center of inversion and perpendicular planes of symmetry.
- **C2v**: A molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would likely be **D∞h**, as linear molecules like CO₂ or O₂ exhibit this symmetry. This aligns with the possibility that E is a highly toxic linear compound, such as phosgene or another similar substance. Based on the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I need to figure out what E looks like.

First, let's parse the reactions. 

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, that's a lot of equivalents, so maybe B is a diatomic gas. 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles reacting with 1 mole of A. Maybe A is something like sulfur because sulfur forms some compounds with high ratios.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps A is an element that forms a compound with B in an 8:1 ratio. Let me think. Oh, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2), but 8 equivalents of Cl2 with Na? That would form NaCl, but that's a 2:1 ratio, so that doesn't fit. Hmm. Or perhaps A is Fe and B is something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur reacting with oxygen. Wait, sulfur (S) can react with oxygen (O2) in such a way. For example, S + O2 → SO2 or SO3. But 8 equivalents would imply a higher ratio. Maybe 4 O2 per S? Not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like I2 (iodine), which is a bright red vapor, but that's when it's a gas. Or maybe it's a compound. Oh, wait, another possibility is that C is a metal sulfide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like FeO or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is an alkali metal, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's move to the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C is treated with water, it produces A and two acids. 

Hmm, that makes me think of a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide (but wait, metal oxides are usually basic, not acidic unless they're transition metals). Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed forms a metal hydroxide and H2S, but H2S is a weak acid. Wait, but in that case, F and G would be H2S and maybe another acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate. Let's think. Suppose A is a metal, like sodium (Na). If A is Na, and B is O2, maybe they form NaO2? But wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, but then the reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But in the first reaction, it's 8 equivalents of B. So 1 A reacting with 8 B molecules. If B is O2, then 8 O2 would mean 16 O atoms. So A would need to combine with 16 O. That might be something like PbO2, but Pb is lead, so maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2. So solid A reacts with 8 Cl2 molecules. That would make a compound like ACl8. What metals form such high chlorides? Hmm, maybe it's iron (Fe), but FeCl8? I think iron usually forms FeCl2, FeCl3, maybe higher chlorides but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state.

Wait, but product C is bright red, which might suggest something else. Let me think about reactions that form red products.

Wait, another angle: The reaction where C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio. What if D is a gas like Cl2? Then, when C reacts with Cl2, perhaps in a substitution reaction. But product E is extremely hazardous, so maybe E is something like phosgene (which is Cl2C=O, but I'm not sure if that's the case here).

Alternatively, when C reacts with D, maybe it's adding across a double bond or something similar.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. If C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a colorless gas, but not red. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, but when sulfides react with water, they usually form H2S and a metal hydroxide, but H2S is a weak acid, so maybe that fits.

Wait, but the first reaction produces C when A reacts with B (gas). Let me think about a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas to form a red product. Oh! Maybe it's the formation of SO3? No, that's not red. Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is O2. Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, which is a solid. But 8 equivalents of O2 would be 8 moles of O2 per mole of Na. So 8 * (O2) → 16 O atoms. So Na would react with 16 O to form NaO8? Not sure if that's a real compound.

Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus (P), and B is O2. So P reacts with O2 to form P4O10, which is white, though. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's move to the reaction where C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. Suppose C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, say, MO, then reacting with water would form M(OH) and possibly H2O. Hmm, but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a higher oxide, like M2O7, which upon hydrolysis could produce H2M2O7 or something else. Wait, perhaps more clues: F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. That suggests that the oxide might be a mixed oxide or something that, upon hydrolysis, produces two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfide, like FeS. Reacting FeS with water wouldn't produce much, but maybe if it's a more complex sulfide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is AlN, which upon hydrolysis gives NH3 and Al(OH)3, but NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a carbide? Like SiC. Reacting with water produces SiO2 (a weak acid, maybe? Well, it's a solid, so not sure) and CH4, which is a neutral gas. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of some sort. Wait, but if C is a salt, reacting with water wouldn't produce two different acids. Unless it's a double salt or something.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say C is ZnSO4. If ZnSO4 reacts with water, it just stays as ZnSO4·nH2O, which doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Reaction of C with D gives E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be a highly toxic gas. For example, something like HCl, but that's not likely. Alternatively, phosgene (Cl2CO), but that's a gas. Or maybe sarin gas? No, that's an organophosphorus compound.

Wait, perhaps E is Cl2O7, which is chlorine pentaoxide or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but that's a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2. Then, C reacts with O2 to form E. But I'm not sure what E would be.

Wait, another thought: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So B and D react to form H. Let me think about common solvents. For instance, if B is Cl2 and D is another halogen, say F2, but H would be... no, perhaps B is H2 and D is something else. Alternatively, if B is CO2 and D is H2O, they can form H2CO3, but that's not a common solvent. Wait, another possibility: B is O2 and D is H2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O, which is a solvent. That could fit.

Wait, but then in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. So A is a metal that forms an oxide with 8 O atoms. For example, if A is Fe, FeO would be Fe:O ratio 1:1, but I need 8 O atoms per A. Wait, perhaps A is something like Fe, and the oxide is FeO4^4- or something, but I don't think such an oxide exists. Alternatively, maybe A is Pb and forms PbO2 (lead(IV) oxide), which has a formula of PbO2. So 1 Pb per 2 O, but that's not 8 O. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is chromium. Chromium can form CrO3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. CrO3 has formula CrO3, so 3 O per Cr. But in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B (O2) would mean 8 O2 molecules, which is 16 O atoms. So if A is Cr, then Cr reacts with 16 O atoms. Let me see: Cr + O2 → CrO4^2- or something. Wait, CrO3 is a solid. So perhaps CrO3 is formed. But how many O2 molecules would that take?

CrO3 has formula CrO3, which is Cr:O ratio of 1:3. O2 is O2, so each molecule has 2 O atoms. So to make CrO3, the reaction would be 2 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 CrO3. So for each Cr, 3 O2 are needed. So 8 equivalents of O2 per Cr would make a different compound. Hmm, perhaps 8 O2 is 16 O atoms. So per mole of A, 16 O atoms. So maybe CrO4^2- or something else.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me see if I can think of another approach.

Wait, the reaction where C reacts with D to form E. If D is O2, then C could be something that reacts with O2 under certain conditions. Alternatively, if D is F2, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: The product when C reacts with water is A plus two acids. So, let's assume C is a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases A and produces two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that contains the cation of A and some anions that become the acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, and when it reacts with water, it produces Fe(OH)2 (which isn't particularly an acid) and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So F and G would be H2S (weak acid) and perhaps another acid, but I'm not sure where the other acid would come from. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and C is NaNO3. Then, when NaNO3 reacts with water, it just stays as NaNO3; it doesn't produce acids. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait another thought: C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide and another acid. Hmm, but most metal oxides are either basic or neutral. Unless it's a transition metal oxide that's amphoteric.

For example, if C is Al2O3, which is amphoteric. So Al2O3 + H2O → Al(OH)3 and perhaps some H+ (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that would react with water to form CO2 and the metal hydroxide, but CO2 is a weak acid.

Wait, but the problem states that when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids F and G. So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases A and produces two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or something similar. Let's think: For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water might not produce much. But maybe under acidic conditions, it could decompose. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the last reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So, possible reactions: H could be a solvent like H2O or something else.

If B is O2 and D is H2, then they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O), so that's 2:1. But the problem says 1:1. So perhaps B is O2 and D is another O-based gas. Or perhaps B is O2 and D is another diatomic gas.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is O2. They don't react in a 1:1 ratio, or at least not to form a common solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl (which is a gas, but HCl is a strong acid, not a solvent). Hmm, but HCl is a liquid when concentrated, but I'm not sure if that's considered a solvent in this context.

Wait, another common solvent is ethanol or something, but how would B and D, which are gases, react to form that? Maybe B is CO2 and D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is another gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B and D are both diatomic gases that combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a liquid. For example, H2 and F2 react in a 1:1 ratio to form HF, which is a liquid (well, at room temperature, it's a liquid but can be a gas when heated). HF is a solvent, so H could be HF.

Wait, that's an interesting thought. So if B is H2 and D is F2, then H would be HF. But let's see if that fits the other reactions.

So, B is H2, D is F2. Then, H is HF.

In the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). Hmm, A reacting with H2 in large amounts. Maybe A is a metal, and the reaction is a hydrogenation. For example, if A is a transition metal like Fe, and it reacts with H2 to form FeH2? But I'm not sure about that. Or perhaps A is a metal that forms a hydride. But I'm not sure how that would relate to the color.

Wait, another possibility: A is an element that forms a compound with H2 in an 8:1 ratio. Let's say A is carbon (C). Then 8 H2 would give 16 H atoms. So C + 8 H2 → CH16? I don't think that's a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is nitrogen. N2 + 8 H2 → NH16? Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S). S + 8 H2 → S H16? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where hydrogen adds to a metal in a high ratio. I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Alternatively, maybe B is not H2 but something else. Let's try another approach.

If H is HF, then D is F2 and B is H2. Then, in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 H2 to form C, which is bright red. So maybe C is FeH (iron hydride), but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound of A with H, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and when it reacts with H2, it forms a metal hydride. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, perhaps C is Fe3O4 (magnetite), which is black, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is CuO, which is black. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If A is sodium (Na), and B is O2, then Na reacts with O2 to form NaO2 (sodium peroxide), which is a pale yellow solid. But the product C is bright red, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of vanadium or another transition metal that has a red color. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not red. Maybe it's another oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of chromium. Chromium(VI) compounds can be orange or yellow. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction where C and D form E. If D is F2, then C reacts with F2 to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So, for example, if C is a metal, then E would be the metal fluoride. But I'm not sure if that's extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3 or something like that, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but E is formed when C reacts with D (F2). So C + F2 → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is ClF3, which is a highly toxic gas. But I'm not sure how that connects.

Let me try to think about the structure of E. The question is about its molecular symmetry group. Common symmetry groups for molecules: 

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: a high symmetry group, like in square planar or octahedral complexes.
- D∞h: an infinite symmetry group, like in a linear molecule with a center of inversion and perpendicular planes of symmetry.
- C2v: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion, like CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a C2 axis and some mirror planes, it might be C2v.

But to determine that, I need to know what E is. So perhaps I should figure out what E is.

Let me go back. Let's recap what I know:

1. Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).
2. Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).
3. Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).
4. Reaction 4: B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

Let me consider possible candidates for H, the solvent. H is formed from B and D in a 1:1 ratio.

If H is H2O, then B and D must combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. So, possible reactions:

B and D could be H2 and O2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio (2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O), so that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, B and D could be O2 and another diatomic gas that reacts 1:1 to form H2O. But I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is F2. Then, H could be O2F2 (dihydrogen monoxide? No, wait, that's H2O. Wait, O2F2 isn't a common solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is another solvent, like ethanol, but that would require B and D to react to form ethanol, which seems unlikely given they're gases.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2 and D is Cl2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl. HCl is a gas but can be a liquid when concentrated. But is HCl considered a solvent? It's used as a solvent in some reactions, but more commonly, it's a strong acid.

Alternatively, perhaps B and D are both H2 and F2, which react in a 1:1 ratio to form 2 HF. But HF is a liquid at room temperature. So H would be HF. That's a solvent. So B is H2, D is F2. Then, H is HF. That seems plausible.

So, B is H2, D is F2. They react to form 2 HF (since 1 H2 + 1 F2 → 2 HF). So that's a 1:1 ratio for B and D to produce H (HF). So that fits.

Now, moving to Reaction 1: A reacts with 8 equivalents of H2 to form C (bright red). So, solid A plus 8 H2 → C.

Possible reaction: A could be a metal that reacts with H2 to form a hydride. For example, Ca reacts with H2 to form CaH2. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another angle: If A is an element that forms a compound with H2 in a high ratio. Let's think about transition metals. For example, if A is Fe, and reacts with H2 (but usually Fe reacts with H2 under certain conditions, like in the Haber process, but that's for NH3). Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal. Let's think about nitrogen. N2 can react with H2 in the Haber process to form NH3, but that's 3 H2 per N2. But in this case, it's 8 H2 per A, which is 16 H atoms. So maybe A is C (carbon), and reacts with H2 to form CH16? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex hydride. For example, Na reacts with H2 to form NaH. But 8 H2 would be 16 H atoms, so perhaps NaH is formed. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a compound that is bright red, maybe it's a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright red. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown. Not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound of vanadium. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe in some other form it's red. Or perhaps C is a chromium compound, like Cr2O3, which is green. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: The product C reacts with water to form A and two acids. If C is a metal oxide, then A would be the metal, and the two acids would be from the hydrolysis. But most metal oxides produce basic solutions. Unless it's an amphoteric oxide.

Wait, perhaps C is Al2O3. Al2O3 reacts with water to form Al(OH)3 and possibly some H+ ions. But Al(OH)3 is amphoteric. But the problem states that two different acids are formed, F and G. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, then reacting with water may not produce much, but under acidic conditions, it could produce H2S (weak acid) and Fe^2+ ions, but Fe^2+ isn't an acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is AlN, then AlN + H2O → Al(OH)3 and NH3. NH3 is a weak base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. Na2CO3 reacts with water to form NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (it's a gas, but in water, it forms H2CO3). So F and G could be H2CO3 and NaOH? But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: When C reacts with water, it produces F and G, which are two different acids. So C must be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases two different acid substances.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and NaOH. But again, NaOH is a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, but that usually hydrolyzes into the corresponding acid and base. For example, Na2SO4 is neutral.

Wait, perhaps C is a polyprotic acid's anhydride. For example, if C is anhydrous H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), but that's a liquid, not a solid. Also, reacting H2SO4 with water wouldn't produce two acids, just the same H2SO4.

Alternatively, think of a compound that can hydrolyze into two different acids. Maybe a mixed anhydride?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For instance, SiC reacts with water to produce CO and SiO2. CO is a neutral gas, and SiO2 is a solid, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: If C is a salt of two different acids. For example, a salt that has two different anions which, when hydrolyzed, produce two different acids. For example, something like Mg(NH2)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate or something similar. I'm not getting anywhere here, so maybe I should think about the first reaction again.

If in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 H2 to form C, which is bright red. Let's say A is Fe. Fe and H2 under certain conditions form FeH2, which might be black. Not red. Alternatively, perhaps A is a non-metal, like S. S and H2 can react to form H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps A is O, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a compound with H2 in a high ratio. Let me think about H2 reacting with a metal to form a hydride. For example, NaH is formed from Na and H2. If A is Na, then 8 H2 would be 16 H atoms. So Na + 8 H2 → NaH2? But NaH is NaH, so maybe Na reacts with 2 H2 to form NaH2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Al. Al reacts with H2 under certain conditions to form AlH3, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another idea: If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps E is sarin gas, but I'm not sure how that would fit. Alternatively, maybe E is phosgene (Cl2CO), which is a toxic gas. Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like HCN, which is highly toxic. But how would that fit the other reactions?

Wait, so E is formed when C reacts with D (F2). So if C is a metal, then E would be the metal fluoride. For example, Fe reacts with F2 to form FeF2 or FeF3. But would that be extremely hazardous? Maybe in some cases, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the reaction where C reacts with F2 to form E. If C is a sulfide, say FeS, then E would be FeF2 and S F2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. If C is FeO, then reacting with F2 would form FeF2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a compound containing both O and another element. For example, if C is SO3, then reacting with F2 would form SO3F2 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, but that doesn't make sense with F2.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about E's structure. If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group could be D∞h or C2v. If it's a bent molecule, maybe C2v. For example, H2O is V-shaped with C2v symmetry. Similarly, O3 has C2v symmetry. Or perhaps E is a molecule with a center of inversion and a C2 axis, leading to D∞h symmetry.

Wait, if E is CO2, which is linear, its symmetry group is D∞h. But would that fit the reactions?

Let me see: If E is CO2, then D would be a gas that reacts with C to form CO2. But I'm not sure how that fits with the rest.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like F2O, but that's not common.

Wait, perhaps E is ClF3. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule with a C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry. For example, octahedral molecules have D4h symmetry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The first reaction produces C, which is bright red. Think of a bright red solid or liquid. One possibility is mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Wait, no, mercury(II) oxide is red, but I'm not sure about its state. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, As2S3 is bright red. Or maybe it's a form of lead oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If C is a sulfide, then when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But the problem states that two different acids are formed, so maybe the metal hydroxide is basic, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxide decomposes further, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry would be D∞h (like CO2 or O2). If E is a bent molecule, it could be C2v (like H2O or O3). If E is a molecule with a two-fold axis and some mirror planes, it could be C2v.

But without knowing E's structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the reactions, perhaps E is a linear molecule, making its symmetry group D∞h.

Wait, but earlier I thought perhaps E is ClF3, which is trigonal pyramidal, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2F2, which is linear, then its symmetry group would be D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But given the options, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and multiple planes of symmetry, D∞h is likely.

So, putting it all together, perhaps E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, making the answer option C) D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The high ratio of gas B (8 equivalents) suggests B could be a diatomic gas like O₂ or H₂. The bright red color of C hints at compounds like certain metal oxides, sulfides, or other red-colored materials. However, the exact identity of A and C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic gas or compound. Possible candidates include phosgene (Cl₂CO), sarin gas, or other toxic substances. However, the exact identity of E is not confirmed.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This indicates that C is likely a compound that hydrolyzes to release A and two acids. For example, if C were a sulfide, it might produce H₂S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. However, the exact nature of C and A is still ambiguous.

4. **Reaction 4**: Gas B reacts with gas D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. If B is H₂ and D is F₂, their reaction could form HF, a liquid solvent. This aligns with the 1:1 ratio and the formation of a solvent.

Given the symmetry options:
- **C2**: A molecule with a two-fold rotation axis.
- **D4h**: A high-symmetry group, common in square planar or octahedral complexes.
- **D∞h**: A symmetry group for linear molecules with a center of inversion and perpendicular planes of symmetry.
- **C2v**: A molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would likely be **D∞h**, as linear molecules like CO₂ or O₂ exhibit this symmetry. This aligns with the possibility that E is a highly toxic linear compound, such as phosgene or another similar substance. Based on the analysis, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
