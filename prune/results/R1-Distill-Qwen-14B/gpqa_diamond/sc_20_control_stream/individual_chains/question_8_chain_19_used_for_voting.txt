Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Let's see, the question describes some experiments with knockout mutants and their resistance levels. I need to figure out which conclusion about the gene interactions is correct based on the results.

First, let me read the question carefully. So they created three knock-out mutants: g1, g2, g3. There are also double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The data shows the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control, which is at 100%. 

The resistance levels are:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance)
- g2: 0% (so very susceptible)
- g3: 50% (more susceptible than wild type)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the numbers are in percentages from the control. So higher is better in terms of resistance. So the wild type is 100%, and mutants have lower resistance, meaning they are more susceptible.

The question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream regulators, activating or repressing other genes.

Our task is to determine the relationships between these genes based on the mutant data. The options suggest various possibilities about whether they are transcription factors, have same promoters, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is about how the expression of one gene affects the expression of another. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A. For example, if a mutation in A masks the effect of mutation in B, then A is epistatic over B.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's directly relevant here, but maybe if multiple genes have the same function.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than each alone.

So let's analyze the data.

Looking at single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's 25% less than wild type. Maybe a partial loss of function, but not completely broken.
- g2 has 0%—so it's completely susceptible. So knocking out g2 makes them completely resistant? No, wait, 0% means they can't resist the pathogen. So g2 is super important. Their resistance is completely gone when g2 is knocked out. So g2 must be critical for resistance. If the wild type is 100%, and g2 is 0, that's a big effect. So perhaps g2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.
- g3 has 50%—so half the resistance. Maybe it's contributing but not as crucial as g2.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0%—so similar to g2. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0, same as when only g2 is knocked out. Wait, that's interesting. Maybe g1 doesn't add anything when g2 is already knocked out. Or perhaps g2 is upstream of g1.

Wait, if g2 is upstream of g1, then knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out g2 alone. So that's what we see here—g1g2 has 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1. Because the mutation in g2 masks the effect of g1. Or another way: the pathway is such that the function of g1 depends on g2. So without g2, the status of g1 doesn't matter.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: resistance is 10%. So that's lower than either individual mutant. Wait, g1 alone is 75%, g3 alone is 50%, but together they're 10%. That suggests that the two are acting in separate pathways, perhaps. Because knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Or maybe they are in the same pathway, but their combined effect is additive.

Alternatively, maybe the pathways are redundant, but that seems less likely here.

Looking at g2g3: 0%. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 0. But when only g2 is knocked out, it's 0. So g3 doesn't add anything when g2 is already knocked out. So again, similar to g1g2. So maybe g2 is upstream of g3 as well.

Another way: if g2 is a transcription factor that activates both g1 and g3, then knocking out g2 would disable both, making the resistance 0. If that's the case, then the double mutants of g2 with any other would still present 0% resistance because the pathway is already blocked.

Wait, but what about g3? Because when g3 is knocked out alone, it's 50% resistance. So the wild type has 100%, g2 knockout is 0%, g3 is 50%. So if g2 is a transcription factor for g3, then in g2 knockout, g3 can't be expressed. But in the g3 knockout, perhaps another pathway is contributing.

Wait, but how about when you have g3 and g2 both knocked out? It's 0%—same as g2 alone. So that doesn't add anything. So perhaps g3 is downstream of g2. So if g2 is knocked out, even if you knock out g3, the effect is same. So the pathway is blocked at g2.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when you have both g1 and g3 knocked out, it's worse than either alone. So if g1 and g3 are in the same pathway, but perhaps they are partially redundant or work in parallel. But 10% is much lower than either 75 or 50. So maybe they are in different pathways, and together they contribute more. But why is the effect additive? Or perhaps they are in the same pathway but each contributes some function.

Alternatively, perhaps g1 and g3 are both required for the same process. So each contributes a part of the function. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost, but each alone has partial loss.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75% (so 25% loss), g3 is 50% (50% loss). So if the function is additive, maybe each contributes a portion.

But for the double mutant g1g3, 10%—so much lower. It's additive? 75 + 50 would be 125% if additive, but that's not how percentages work. Wait, maybe it's multiplicative. 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5%, but the observed is 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the double mutant is worse than either, but not additive. Maybe they function in separate pathways, and the combined effect is more severe. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic over G1.

Wait, but from the data, g2 is 0% which is worse than g1 (75%). So if g2 is a TF, then it's acting upstream. If G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean that the presence of G2 mutation masks the effect of G1. So when both are mutated, the phenotype is same as G2 mutation. Which is what we see in g1g2 and g2g3: they are 0% same as g2.

So in option A, G2 is epistatic towards G1. That matches.

But the option says G1 is a TF. But the question states that at least one is a TF. If G2 is the TF, then what? Let's look at other options.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. The double mutant g1g3 would have 10%, which is worse than either. If they have same promoter, perhaps they are part of a redundant system. But I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So G1 is epistatic over G3. That would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is functional. So in double mutant G1g3, the resistance would be worse than either single. Which is what we see: 10% is worse than G1 (75) and G3 (50).

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of G3 would depend on G1. So in G1 knockout, the G3 knockout doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked at G1. But in our data, for the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0, same as g2. So if G2 is a TF, then that makes sense.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in g1g3, the effect would be as bad as the worse of the two, but in reality, it's worse than either. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than each alone. Which is what we see in g1g3, which is 10%—worse than either 75 or 50. So that fits.

But how about the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. So if G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect is masked.

Wait, but when G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. That explains the single mutant g2: 0%.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: same as g2, 0%. So the presence of g1 doesn't matter when g2 is knocked out. So again, g2 is upstream.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both g1 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is much worse. If they are redundant, then each alone can provide some resistance, but together they're both gone, so more susceptible.

But why is their combined resistance 10%? Hmm.

Wait, if both g1 and g3 are transcription factors that contribute to the same process, but each can partially compensate for the other, then knocking out both would be worse than either alone.

So let's go back to the data.

g1: 75% (so 25% loss)

g3: 50% (50% loss)

If they are redundant, the function is additive. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost. So 0%? But g1g3 is 10%, not 0. So maybe they are not completely redundant, but each contributes a part.

Alternatively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways. So knocking out both would lead to the combined effect of both pathways being compromised.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, let's evaluate each.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G2 is epistatic over G1, then the mutations in G2 would mask the effect of G1. So in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%, same as g2. That's correct.

But if G1 is a TF, why is g1g3 10%? g1 is 75%, g3 is 50. So when both are knocked out, it's 10%. Maybe they function in separate pathways, so together they have a more severe effect.

But the initial condition says at least one is a TF. If G1 is the TF, then G2 and G3 are possibly downstream.

But the data for the single mutants doesn't fit that because g2 is 0%—so knocking out a downstream gene would not make the resistance worse than the TF's knockout. Wait, but if G2 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would not affect G1's function. So if G1 is the TF, then knocking out G2 would only prevent G2's function, which might be a target of G1.

But if G2 is a downstream gene that is critical, then without G2, even if G1 is functional, the resistance is lost. That would suggest that G2 is necessary for resistance regardless of G1's function. So perhaps G2 is the key gene.

Wait, but the question states that at least one is a TF. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it activates other genes, possibly G1 and G3.

So when G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 might not be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But wait, in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 are 75% and 50%. So if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 must be downstream of G2. So knocking out G2 would prevent their expression, making the resistance 0. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are present, so their functions can contribute.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So let's see: g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates a pathway, and G1 and G3 are in that pathway. Let's think about the epistasis.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2, so this suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2, so G2 is epistatic over G3.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance plummets.

So let's model this.

G2 is a transcription factor. It activates two downstream genes, G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. Each of these pathways contributes to the overall resistance.

So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed → resistance is 0%.

In the single mutants:

g1: G1 is knocked out, but G3 is functional → resistance is determined by G3's function. So why is g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%? Hmm, perhaps G3 contributes more to resistance than G1.

Wait, no. Because when G1 is knocked out, but G3 is functional, the resistance is 75%. But when G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. So G1's function must be more significant than G3's. Because without G1, resistance is better than without G3.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes for resistance.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are TFs themselves, acting downstream of G2.

But according to the question, only one of the three (G1, G2, G3) is a TF. So the question says "at least one" is a TF. So it's possible that G2 is a TF, and the others are not.

So if G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway or different, let's see.

In the data, when you knock out G2, resistance is 0% → so the rest of the pathway can't function without G2.

When you knock out G1, you still have G3, but the resistance is 75% (g1). So that suggests that G3 alone can provide 75% resistance, but in the wild type, with both G1 and G3, it's 100%.

Wait, no. The wild type is 100%, but if G1 is knocked out, why is it 75%? Because perhaps G3 is compensating.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So in the wild type, they work together, so knocking out one (say G1) reduces resistance to 75% because G3 is still working. But knocking out both (g1g3) brings it down to 10%—so both are needed for full resistance.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think in terms of epistasis.

Epistatic relationships:

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. So if A is knocked out, the mutation in B doesn't change the phenotype.

In our data:

In g1g2, resistance is 0% → same as g2.

Therefore, G2 is epistatic over G1. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, resistance is 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic over G3.

So G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3.

Which means G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Which suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.

Wait, but in single mutants:

- g1 is 75% → so without G1, resistance is 75% of wild type. So perhaps G1's role is not as critical as G2's. But in the wild type, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are functioning.

If G2 is a TF upstream of both, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, which would explain the 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed, but G1 is not. So the resistance is 75%: perhaps G3 alone can provide 75% of the resistance, but the wild type has both G1 and G3, leading to 100%.

Wait, but if G3 alone is 75%, why is g3 at 50%? Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is activating another gene, say Gene X, which is responsible for the resistance. So G1 and G3 are not directly involved in the resistance but perhaps in other pathways.

But the data shows that g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance more than G1.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates Gene X, which is necessary for resistance. But that doesn't explain the effects of g1 and g3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are themselves TFs for other genes. But the question says only one is a TF.

Wait, the question says at least one is a TF. So perhaps G2 is the only TF, and the others are not. So G2's function is critical for the pathway.

In that case, the mutants would behave as follows:

- g2: 0% → because without G2's function (as TF), the necessary downstream genes aren't expressed.

- g1: 75% → because G1 is not a TF, but perhaps contributes to the resistance through another mechanism. Without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild type.

- g3: 50% → perhaps G3 contributes, but less so than others.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → same as g2, because without G2, G1 doesn't matter.

- g1g3: 10% → worse than either single mutant. So both G1 and G3 are contributing, but their combined loss leads to much lower resistance. So perhaps they are in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance, but G2 is necessary for their function.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is functional, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But why is resistance only 10%? That doesn't make sense. Unless G1 and G3 are not functioning correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant system, but their function is additive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is epistatic towards G1 (since g1g2 is 0% same as g2).

If G1 is a TF, then G2 being downstream would make sense. But why is g2 0%? Because without G2, which is downstream of G1, the resistance is 0%? That would suggest that G2 is essential for resistance, which is critical.

But if G1 is a TF, then G2 is downstream. So without G1, G2 isn't activated? But that doesn't fit because in the g1 mutant, G2 is present (as resistance is 75%). So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

So G2 activates both G1 and G3. So in the single mutants:

- g2: 0% → neither G1 nor G3 are expressed.

- g1: 75% → G3 is functioning, but perhaps its contribution is 75% of the wild type.

- g3: 50% → G1 is functioning, contributing 50% of the wild type.

Hmm, that could be. Because in the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So their combined function leads to 100%. Without G1, G3's contribution (50%) brings resistance to 50%? Wait, but in reality, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So G1 is a TF, and G3 is downstream.

In that case, g1 would have a more severe phenotype than g3. But in the data, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%—so g3 is more affected. So that model doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is a TF that activates two independent pathways, each involving G1 and G3.

Wait, perhaps G2's function is necessary for both G1 and G3 to be expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 are present (they have some resistance), so that suggests that G2 isn't required for their expression. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach it with the options.

Looking at option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that both G1 and G3 can perform the same function. So their combined knockout would have a more severe effect than each alone.

In the data, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75, g3 is 50). So this fits with redundancy—each contributes, but together they're both gone, leading to more severe phenotype.

So if G2 is a TF, what does that imply?

If G2 is a TF, then it's upstream. So in the single mutant g2, resistance is 0%, meaning it's essential for the resistance pathway.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic.

g3g2: 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either single mutant. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance than either alone.

But how does this fit with the single mutants' resistances?

In the wild type, with G2, G1, and G3 all functional, resistance is 100%.

In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are functional. Since G1 and G3 are redundant, G3 can compensate, leading to 75% resistance. Hmm, but 75% is more than half. So maybe each contributes 25% and 50% or something.

Wait, perhaps the resistance is additive. If each gene contributes 25% (so G1 and G3 each contribute 25% each), then in the wild type with both, 50%? But that's not matching the data. Because the wild type is 100%.

Alternatively, perhaps each contributes 50% each.

So in the wild type, both contribute, leading to 100% (50 + 50).

In the g1 mutant: only G3 contributes → 50% (but in data, g1 is 75%). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each contributes 75% and 50% respectively. So in the wild type, 100% (75 + 25?), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, perhaps G1 is part of a more critical pathway, so without G1, the resistance drops more.

Alternatively, maybe the function isn't additive but something else.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to the same phenotype. So without G1, the pathway through G3 is still active, but at a lower level.

But considering the options, let's see which one aligns.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the epistatic part would mean that G1's function masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, but under this option, G1 is epistatic, so perhaps the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is worse, leading to the 10% figure.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

From the data:

- G2 is the most critical, as its single mutant has 0% resistance.

- G1 and G3 contribute less, but their combined knockout leads to a more severe effect than either alone (g1g3: 10%).

- G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, since the double mutants with G2 are 0%.

So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is the TF.

Now, the question says that at least one is a TF. So G2 is the TF.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

G1: 75% resistance → so it's contributing, but not as much as G2.

G3: 50% → contributes less than G1.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either. So perhaps each contributes a part, and together they're gone, leading to a more severe phenotype. That suggests redundancy, but the combined effect is worse than either, which would happen if they are in different pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps they're in the same pathway and each contributes a part.

But in the case where they are redundant, each can compensate for the other. So in the single mutants, each contributes some resistance, but together, they're both gone, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, with G2 as the TF upstream.

So which option aligns with this?

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if they are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than each alone. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% vs 75 and 50).

Epistasis: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in the absence of G1, G3's mutation doesn't matter. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, whereas g3 alone is 50%. So that doesn't fit. Because if G3's effect is only seen when G1 is present, then g3 alone should be similar to wild type, but in reality, g3 is 50%.

Hmm, perhaps the epistatic relationship is the other way around.

Wait, what if G3 is epistatic over G1? Then the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would depend on G3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that affects the resistance here.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Let's try to match the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct. But if G1 is the TF, why is G2's single mutant 0%? Because G1 is upstream of G2, which would mean that without G1, G2 isn't expressed. But in the data, in g1, G2 is present (g1 has 75% resistance), so that can't be.

So option A is unlikely.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would imply they're co-regulated. So if G2 is a TF, it would activate both. But the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. If their promoters are same, then knocking out both would have same effect as G2 knockout, but in the data, g1g3 is 10% and G2 knockout is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in g3 single mutant, the resistance would be 75% (same as g1), but in reality, g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

In the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → so G3 is functional and provides 75% resistance.

- g3: 50% → so G1 is functional and provides 50% resistance.

But in the wild type, both are functional, providing 100% resistance. So each contributes a portion.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% → which is much lower than either. So when both pathways are knocked out, resistance is minimal.

Which would imply that without both, the plant can't resist at all, but that's not the case here (10%). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 activate different downstream genes. So when both are knocked out, the downstream genes are not expressed, leading to a more severe phenotype.

But without knowing the exact pathways, it's hard. Let's think again.

The most consistent conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor. Because G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, and it's epistatic over G1 and G3.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 are each contributing to resistance but in a way that their combined loss leads to a much more severe phenotype.

This suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. So knocking out both leads to a larger effect than either alone.

In that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways. But looking at the options, none of them state that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, since G2 is epistatic, but G1 is TF, which is unlikely given the data.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: G2 activates both. So in g1g3, same as g2? But in reality, g1g3 is 10% vs g2's 0. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy: each affects multiple traits. Not sure. But if G1 is epistatic, then g3's effect is seen only when G1 is present. But in data, g3 is 50% even when G1 is present (g3 is a single mutant). So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy: each can compensate. So in the double mutant, resistance drops more. But if G1 is epistatic over G3, then knocking out G1 would show the effect of G3 only when G1 is present. But data shows g3 is 50% when G1 is present.

Hmm. I'm not fully confident, but perhaps option D is the correct one. Because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. Also, G1 being epistatic over G3 would mean that when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is more severe.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the phenotype of G3 depends on G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G1 knockout, which is 75%. But in the data, it's 10%, so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each term in the options means.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only visible when G1 is present. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best fit is option A.

Wait, no. Because option A says G1 is a TF, which would not fit because G2's knockout is 0%, which suggests G2 is more critical.

Wait, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is functional. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3's knockout when G1 is present. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the explanation is that G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which are in the same pathway but contribute additively.

Wait, in the single mutants:

g1: 75% → so G3 is functional, contributing 75% of the wild-type resistance.

g3: 50% → G1 is functional, contributing 50% of wild-type resistance.

In the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute, leading to 100%. So their functions are additive.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is less than either. So their combined loss leads to additive loss beyond either single.

In that case, perhaps the model is that G2 activates G1 and G3, each contributing to resistance. So their functions are additive.

So when G2 is knocked out, both are non-functional → 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out, G3 provides 75% of resistance.

When G3 is knocked out, G1 provides 50% of resistance.

Wait, but that would mean that G1's contribution is more significant than G3's. So in the wild type, G1 contributes 50%, G3 contributes 50%, totaling 100%.

In the g1 mutant: G3 provides 50%, but in data, it's 75%. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. So in the wild type, 100%. In g1: 25%, but data says 75%. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each contributes 50%, but when both are present, they work synergistically to give 100%. So in g1, G3 is present and provides 50% → but data says 75%. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF. G1 and G3 are each contributing to resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower, suggesting they work in separate pathways. Their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype, which suggests that each contributes some resistance, and their functions are not completely overlapping.

Looking back at the options, the only one that aligns with G2 being the TF is option D and option C.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their combined knockout leads to more severe phenotype. Which matches the data.

So I'll go with option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as G1's mutant, which is 75%. But in data, it's 10%. So that seems contradictory.

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the epistasis direction wrong.

Epistasis: If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B is masked in the presence of a mutation in gene A.

So, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the mutation in G3 has no effect when G1 is mutated.

Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So the effect of G3's mutation is not masked by G1's mutation, but the combined effect is worse.

But according to the option, G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean that the effect of G3's mutation is seen only when G1 is functional. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's mutation doesn't affect the phenotype. But data shows that in the double mutant, resistance is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm getting stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF because it's epistatic. The only option where G2 is a TF is options A, B, C, D. All options except option B and C have G2 as TF.

Wait, no: option A says G1 is TF. Option B: G2 is TF. Option C: G2 is TF. Option D: G2 is TF.

So for all options except A, G2 is the TF.

The correct conclusion must be that G2 is the TF.

Now, among the options, which fit.

The other part of the options is about G1 and G3's relationship.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their functions are overlapping. So knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype, which matches the data. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe effect than either alone. Which is what we see: g1g3 is 10%, worse than 75 and 50. So that fits.

But what about the epistasis part? In option D, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 when G1 is present. But in data, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe the epistasis part isn't the key here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (not redundant), and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Option A: G1 is the TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But in that case, G2 is epistatic to G1, which fits the data (g1g2 is 0% same as g2). But if G1 is the TF, why is the single mutant g2 at 0%? Because G2 is epistatic, but if G1 is the TF, then G2's function depends on G1. So without G1, G2 can't function. But in the data, g2 is 0%, but g1 is 75%. So that's a contradiction.

So I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then G2 is downstream of G1.

So if G1 is a TF, then G2 is downstream.

In the single mutant g2, resistance is 0% → so G2's function is critical.

In the single mutant g1, resistance is 75% → so G2 is functional, but perhaps G3 is not. Or maybe G2 is functional but another gene is affected.

But if G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream, then in g1 mutant, G2 wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G2 is functional. So that can't be.

Therefore, option A is invalid.

This brings me back to option D.

Even though I'm not entirely confident, based on the data, the best fit is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the data for g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either. If they're redundant, knocking out both shouldn't make it worse than either, but better than each.

No, wait, gene redundancy means that knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Because each can compensate when the other is present.

Wait, no. That's not redundancy. Redundant genes can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either alone.

So for example, if two genes each contribute 50% of the function, then in the double mutant, the function is 0%, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So in that case, g1g3 would have 0% resistance, but in data, it's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps they are not completely redundant but contribute partially.

But I'm not making progress. I think I have to go with option A.

Wait, no! Another approach: the epistasis hierarchy.

The hierarchy of epistasis is based on where the genes function in the pathway.

In a pathway A → B → C, a mutation in A is epistatic to B and C. A mutation in B is epistatic to C.

In our case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

So G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, in the single mutants:

g1: G1 is not functional. So the pathway through G1 is broken. But what's the alternative? Maybe G3 is still functional and provides some resistance.

In the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G3 alone can provide 75% resistance, but in the g3 mutant, G1 is functional and provides 50% resistance.

Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I need to model this.

Let me model that G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which in turn activate resistance genes.

In the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active → high resistance.

In g1 mutant: G3 is active → providing 75% resistance.

In g3 mutant: G1 is active → providing 50% resistance.

Wait, but that would mean that G3 contributes more than G1. So when G3 is present, it provides 75% resistance. When G1 is present, 50%.

In the wild type, both are present, so resistance is 100%.

In g1g3 mutant: neither G1 nor G3 is active → 0% resistance. But data says 10%. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G2 activates a gene X, which is necessary for resistance. But that wouldn't explain the single mutant data.

Alternative model: G2 activates two separate pathways, each of which contributes to resistance. G1 is in one, G3 in another.

In the wild type, both pathways contribute to 100% resistance.

In g1 mutant: only G3's pathway is active → 75% resistance.

In g3 mutant: only G1's pathway is active → 50% resistance.

In g1g3 mutant: neither pathway is active → 0% resistance. But data says 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each pathway contributes partially.

In the wild type: 100% (G1's 75% + G3's 25%).

In g1 mutant: G3's 25% → 25% resistance.

But data says g1 is 75% → so this model doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. I think I have to make an educated guess based on the data.

The only option that has G2 as the TF and explains the epistatic relationships is option A, but I think I'm wrong.

Upon reviewing, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to a much lower resistance, suggesting they contribute to resistance through different mechanisms.

But looking at the options, perhaps option A is not correct. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which would mean that knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Which we do see in the data. So that fits.

But how does that fit with the epistasis? G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G1's mutant. But in reality, it's worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the epistasis is the other way around: G3 is epistatic over G1. Then, in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G3's mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

I'm really not sure. Maybe the correct answer is option A.

No, I think I'll go with option D. Because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. Even though the epistasis part is confusing, option D seems the best fit.

The question involves determining the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on their contributions to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experimental data shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants, and the goal is to identify the correct conclusion about gene interactions.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild type but not completely lost).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, indicating G2 is critical).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).

2. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, suggesting G2 is epistatic over G1).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, indicating G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, suggesting G2 is epistatic over G3).

3. **Epistasis**:
   - G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, as the resistance of double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) matches the resistance of g2 alone.

4. **Gene Contributions**:
   - G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, as their single mutants show reduced resistance compared to the wild type.
   - The combined knockout of G1 and G3 (g1g3) results in 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are not fully redundant but contribute independently to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor (TF), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2's knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, indicating G2 is the critical gene, not G1. Thus, G1 cannot be the TF.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (implying co-regulation), and G3 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent because the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea that G1 and G3 are co-regulated.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 being the TF fits the data, pleiotropy is not supported by the resistance levels. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 does not explain why the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns with the data in several ways:
  - G2 is the TF, as it is critical for resistance (g2 has 0% resistance).
  - G1 and G3 show redundancy, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a more severe phenotype (10% resistance) than either single mutant.
  - The statement that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is less consistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either single mutant. However, this option is the best fit overall.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute redundantly to resistance. While the epistasis relationship is less clear, option D provides the most consistent explanation for the observed resistance levels.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Let's see, the question describes some experiments with knockout mutants and their resistance levels. I need to figure out which conclusion about the gene interactions is correct based on the results.

First, let me read the question carefully. So they created three knock-out mutants: g1, g2, g3. There are also double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The data shows the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control, which is at 100%. 

The resistance levels are:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance)
- g2: 0% (so very susceptible)
- g3: 50% (more susceptible than wild type)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the numbers are in percentages from the control. So higher is better in terms of resistance. So the wild type is 100%, and mutants have lower resistance, meaning they are more susceptible.

The question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream regulators, activating or repressing other genes.

Our task is to determine the relationships between these genes based on the mutant data. The options suggest various possibilities about whether they are transcription factors, have same promoters, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is about how the expression of one gene affects the expression of another. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A. For example, if a mutation in A masks the effect of mutation in B, then A is epistatic over B.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's directly relevant here, but maybe if multiple genes have the same function.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than each alone.

So let's analyze the data.

Looking at single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's 25% less than wild type. Maybe a partial loss of function, but not completely broken.
- g2 has 0%—so it's completely susceptible. So knocking out g2 makes them completely resistant? No, wait, 0% means they can't resist the pathogen. So g2 is super important. Their resistance is completely gone when g2 is knocked out. So g2 must be critical for resistance. If the wild type is 100%, and g2 is 0, that's a big effect. So perhaps g2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.
- g3 has 50%—so half the resistance. Maybe it's contributing but not as crucial as g2.

Double mutants:

g1g2: 0%—so similar to g2. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0, same as when only g2 is knocked out. Wait, that's interesting. Maybe g1 doesn't add anything when g2 is already knocked out. Or perhaps g2 is upstream of g1.

Wait, if g2 is upstream of g1, then knocking out both would have the same effect as knocking out g2 alone. So that's what we see here—g1g2 has 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that g2 is epistatic to g1. Because the mutation in g2 masks the effect of g1. Or another way: the pathway is such that the function of g1 depends on g2. So without g2, the status of g1 doesn't matter.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: resistance is 10%. So that's lower than either individual mutant. Wait, g1 alone is 75%, g3 alone is 50%, but together they're 10%. That suggests that the two are acting in separate pathways, perhaps. Because knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Or maybe they are in the same pathway, but their combined effect is additive.

Alternatively, maybe the pathways are redundant, but that seems less likely here.

Looking at g2g3: 0%. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 0. But when only g2 is knocked out, it's 0. So g3 doesn't add anything when g2 is already knocked out. So again, similar to g1g2. So maybe g2 is upstream of g3 as well.

Another way: if g2 is a transcription factor that activates both g1 and g3, then knocking out g2 would disable both, making the resistance 0. If that's the case, then the double mutants of g2 with any other would still present 0% resistance because the pathway is already blocked.

Wait, but what about g3? Because when g3 is knocked out alone, it's 50% resistance. So the wild type has 100%, g2 knockout is 0%, g3 is 50%. So if g2 is a transcription factor for g3, then in g2 knockout, g3 can't be expressed. But in the g3 knockout, perhaps another pathway is contributing.

Wait, but how about when you have g3 and g2 both knocked out? It's 0%—same as g2 alone. So that doesn't add anything. So perhaps g3 is downstream of g2. So if g2 is knocked out, even if you knock out g3, the effect is same. So the pathway is blocked at g2.

Similarly, looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. So when you have both g1 and g3 knocked out, it's worse than either alone. So if g1 and g3 are in the same pathway, but perhaps they are partially redundant or work in parallel. But 10% is much lower than either 75 or 50. So maybe they are in different pathways, and together they contribute more. But why is the effect additive? Or perhaps they are in the same pathway but each contributes some function.

Alternatively, perhaps g1 and g3 are both required for the same process. So each contributes a part of the function. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost, but each alone has partial loss.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75% (so 25% loss), g3 is 50% (50% loss). So if the function is additive, maybe each contributes a portion.

But for the double mutant g1g3, 10%—so much lower. It's additive? 75 + 50 would be 125% if additive, but that's not how percentages work. Wait, maybe it's multiplicative. 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375, which is 37.5%, but the observed is 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the double mutant is worse than either, but not additive. Maybe they function in separate pathways, and the combined effect is more severe. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic over G1.

Wait, but from the data, g2 is 0% which is worse than g1 (75%). So if g2 is a TF, then it's acting upstream. If G2 is epistatic over G1, that would mean that the presence of G2 mutation masks the effect of G1. So when both are mutated, the phenotype is same as G2 mutation. Which is what we see in g1g2 and g2g3: they are 0% same as g2.

So in option A, G2 is epistatic towards G1. That matches.

But the option says G1 is a TF. But the question states that at least one is a TF. If G2 is the TF, then what? Let's look at other options.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. The double mutant g1g3 would have 10%, which is worse than either. If they have same promoter, perhaps they are part of a redundant system. But I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So G1 is epistatic over G3. That would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is functional. So in double mutant G1g3, the resistance would be worse than either single. Which is what we see: 10% is worse than G1 (75) and G3 (50).

Wait, but if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the phenotype of G3 would depend on G1. So in G1 knockout, the G3 knockout doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked at G1. But in our data, for the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0, same as g2. So if G2 is a TF, then that makes sense.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then in g1g3, the effect would be as bad as the worse of the two, but in reality, it's worse than either. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than each alone. Which is what we see in g1g3, which is 10%—worse than either 75 or 50. So that fits.

But how about the epistasis part. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 depends on G1. So if G1 is knocked out, then G3's effect is masked.

Wait, but when G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to 0% resistance. That explains the single mutant g2: 0%.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: same as g2, 0%. So the presence of g1 doesn't matter when g2 is knocked out. So again, g2 is upstream.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So when both g1 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is much worse. If they are redundant, then each alone can provide some resistance, but together they're both gone, so more susceptible.

But why is their combined resistance 10%? Hmm.

Wait, if both g1 and g3 are transcription factors that contribute to the same process, but each can partially compensate for the other, then knocking out both would be worse than either alone.

So let's go back to the data.

g1: 75% (so 25% loss)

g3: 50% (50% loss)

If they are redundant, the function is additive. So when both are knocked out, the function is completely lost. So 0%? But g1g3 is 10%, not 0. So maybe they are not completely redundant, but each contributes a part.

Alternatively, perhaps they are in parallel pathways. So knocking out both would lead to the combined effect of both pathways being compromised.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, let's evaluate each.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But if G2 is epistatic over G1, then the mutations in G2 would mask the effect of G1. So in the double mutant g1g2, it's 0%, same as g2. That's correct.

But if G1 is a TF, why is g1g3 10%? g1 is 75%, g3 is 50. So when both are knocked out, it's 10%. Maybe they function in separate pathways, so together they have a more severe effect.

But the initial condition says at least one is a TF. If G1 is the TF, then G2 and G3 are possibly downstream.

But the data for the single mutants doesn't fit that because g2 is 0%—so knocking out a downstream gene would not make the resistance worse than the TF's knockout. Wait, but if G2 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G2 would not affect G1's function. So if G1 is the TF, then knocking out G2 would only prevent G2's function, which might be a target of G1.

But if G2 is a downstream gene that is critical, then without G2, even if G1 is functional, the resistance is lost. That would suggest that G2 is necessary for resistance regardless of G1's function. So perhaps G2 is the key gene.

Wait, but the question states that at least one is a TF. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it activates other genes, possibly G1 and G3.

So when G2 is knocked out (g2), then G1 and G3 might not be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But wait, in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 are 75% and 50%. So if G2 is the TF, then G1 and G3 must be downstream of G2. So knocking out G2 would prevent their expression, making the resistance 0. But in the single mutants, G1 and G3 are present, so their functions can contribute.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So let's see: g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates a pathway, and G1 and G3 are in that pathway. Let's think about the epistasis.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2, so this suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1.

g2g3: 0% → same as g2, so G2 is epistatic over G3.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and when both are knocked out, the resistance plummets.

So let's model this.

G2 is a transcription factor. It activates two downstream genes, G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. Each of these pathways contributes to the overall resistance.

So when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed → resistance is 0%.

In the single mutants:

g1: G1 is knocked out, but G3 is functional → resistance is determined by G3's function. So why is g1 at 75% and g3 at 50%? Hmm, perhaps G3 contributes more to resistance than G1.

Wait, no. Because when G1 is knocked out, but G3 is functional, the resistance is 75%. But when G3 is knocked out, it's 50%. So G1's function must be more significant than G3's. Because without G1, resistance is better than without G3.

Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes for resistance.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are TFs themselves, acting downstream of G2.

But according to the question, only one of the three (G1, G2, G3) is a TF. So the question says "at least one" is a TF. So it's possible that G2 is a TF, and the others are not.

So if G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway or different, let's see.

In the data, when you knock out G2, resistance is 0% → so the rest of the pathway can't function without G2.

When you knock out G1, you still have G3, but the resistance is 75% (g1). So that suggests that G3 alone can provide 75% resistance, but in the wild type, with both G1 and G3, it's 100%.

Wait, no. The wild type is 100%, but if G1 is knocked out, why is it 75%? Because perhaps G3 is compensating.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So in the wild type, they work together, so knocking out one (say G1) reduces resistance to 75% because G3 is still working. But knocking out both (g1g3) brings it down to 10%—so both are needed for full resistance.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think in terms of epistasis.

Epistatic relationships:

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. So if A is knocked out, the mutation in B doesn't change the phenotype.

In our data:

In g1g2, resistance is 0% → same as g2.

Therefore, G2 is epistatic over G1. Because the presence of a mutation in G2 masks the effect of G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, resistance is 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic over G3.

So G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3.

Which means G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Which suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3.

Wait, but in single mutants:

- g1 is 75% → so without G1, resistance is 75% of wild type. So perhaps G1's role is not as critical as G2's. But in the wild type, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are functioning.

If G2 is a TF upstream of both, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, which would explain the 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed, but G1 is not. So the resistance is 75%: perhaps G3 alone can provide 75% of the resistance, but the wild type has both G1 and G3, leading to 100%.

Wait, but if G3 alone is 75%, why is g3 at 50%? Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is activating another gene, say Gene X, which is responsible for the resistance. So G1 and G3 are not directly involved in the resistance but perhaps in other pathways.

But the data shows that g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance more than G1.

Hmm, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates Gene X, which is necessary for resistance. But that doesn't explain the effects of g1 and g3.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are themselves TFs for other genes. But the question says only one is a TF.

Wait, the question says at least one is a TF. So perhaps G2 is the only TF, and the others are not. So G2's function is critical for the pathway.

In that case, the mutants would behave as follows:

- g2: 0% → because without G2's function (as TF), the necessary downstream genes aren't expressed.

- g1: 75% → because G1 is not a TF, but perhaps contributes to the resistance through another mechanism. Without G1, the resistance is 75% of wild type.

- g3: 50% → perhaps G3 contributes, but less so than others.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → same as g2, because without G2, G1 doesn't matter.

- g1g3: 10% → worse than either single mutant. So both G1 and G3 are contributing, but their combined loss leads to much lower resistance. So perhaps they are in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance, but G2 is necessary for their function.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF that activates G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is functional, so G1 and G3 are expressed. But why is resistance only 10%? That doesn't make sense. Unless G1 and G3 are not functioning correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are part of a redundant system, but their function is additive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option A) G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is epistatic towards G1 (since g1g2 is 0% same as g2).

If G1 is a TF, then G2 being downstream would make sense. But why is g2 0%? Because without G2, which is downstream of G1, the resistance is 0%? That would suggest that G2 is essential for resistance, which is critical.

But if G1 is a TF, then G2 is downstream. So without G1, G2 isn't activated? But that doesn't fit because in the g1 mutant, G2 is present (as resistance is 75%). So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

So G2 activates both G1 and G3. So in the single mutants:

- g2: 0% → neither G1 nor G3 are expressed.

- g1: 75% → G3 is functioning, but perhaps its contribution is 75% of the wild type.

- g3: 50% → G1 is functioning, contributing 50% of the wild type.

Hmm, that could be. Because in the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So their combined function leads to 100%. Without G1, G3's contribution (50%) brings resistance to 50%? Wait, but in reality, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So G1 is a TF, and G3 is downstream.

In that case, g1 would have a more severe phenotype than g3. But in the data, g1 is 75%, and g3 is 50%—so g3 is more affected. So that model doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2 is a TF that activates two independent pathways, each involving G1 and G3.

Wait, perhaps G2's function is necessary for both G1 and G3 to be expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 and g3 are present (they have some resistance), so that suggests that G2 isn't required for their expression. That can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach it with the options.

Looking at option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy means that both G1 and G3 can perform the same function. So their combined knockout would have a more severe effect than each alone.

In the data, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (g1 is 75, g3 is 50). So this fits with redundancy—each contributes, but together they're both gone, leading to more severe phenotype.

So if G2 is a TF, what does that imply?

If G2 is a TF, then it's upstream. So in the single mutant g2, resistance is 0%, meaning it's essential for the resistance pathway.

In the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic.

g3g2: 0% → same as g2 → G2 is epistatic.

g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either single mutant. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance than either alone.

But how does this fit with the single mutants' resistances?

In the wild type, with G2, G1, and G3 all functional, resistance is 100%.

In g1 mutant: G2 and G3 are functional. Since G1 and G3 are redundant, G3 can compensate, leading to 75% resistance. Hmm, but 75% is more than half. So maybe each contributes 25% and 50% or something.

Wait, perhaps the resistance is additive. If each gene contributes 25% (so G1 and G3 each contribute 25% each), then in the wild type with both, 50%? But that's not matching the data. Because the wild type is 100%.

Alternatively, perhaps each contributes 50% each.

So in the wild type, both contribute, leading to 100% (50 + 50).

In the g1 mutant: only G3 contributes → 50% (but in data, g1 is 75%). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each contributes 75% and 50% respectively. So in the wild type, 100% (75 + 25?), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

Wait, perhaps G1 is part of a more critical pathway, so without G1, the resistance drops more.

Alternatively, maybe the function isn't additive but something else.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to the same phenotype. So without G1, the pathway through G3 is still active, but at a lower level.

But considering the options, let's see which one aligns.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the epistatic part would mean that G1's function masks the effect of G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, but under this option, G1 is epistatic, so perhaps the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is worse, leading to the 10% figure.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

From the data:

- G2 is the most critical, as its single mutant has 0% resistance.

- G1 and G3 contribute less, but their combined knockout leads to a more severe effect than either alone (g1g3: 10%).

- G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, since the double mutants with G2 are 0%.

So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is the TF.

Now, the question says that at least one is a TF. So G2 is the TF.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

G1: 75% resistance → so it's contributing, but not as much as G2.

G3: 50% → contributes less than G1.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% → which is worse than either. So perhaps each contributes a part, and together they're gone, leading to a more severe phenotype. That suggests redundancy, but the combined effect is worse than either, which would happen if they are in different pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps they're in the same pathway and each contributes a part.

But in the case where they are redundant, each can compensate for the other. So in the single mutants, each contributes some resistance, but together, they're both gone, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So, with G2 as the TF upstream.

So which option aligns with this?

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But if they are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe phenotype than each alone. Which is what we see in g1g3 (10% vs 75 and 50).

Epistasis: G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in the absence of G1, G3's mutation doesn't matter. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, whereas g3 alone is 50%. So that doesn't fit. Because if G3's effect is only seen when G1 is present, then g3 alone should be similar to wild type, but in reality, g3 is 50%.

Hmm, perhaps the epistatic relationship is the other way around.

Wait, what if G3 is epistatic over G1? Then the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would depend on G3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that affects the resistance here.

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Let's try to match the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct. But if G1 is the TF, why is G2's single mutant 0%? Because G1 is upstream of G2, which would mean that without G1, G2 isn't expressed. But in the data, in g1, G2 is present (g1 has 75% resistance), so that can't be.

So option A is unlikely.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would imply they're co-regulated. So if G2 is a TF, it would activate both. But the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. If their promoters are same, then knocking out both would have same effect as G2 knockout, but in the data, g1g3 is 10% and G2 knockout is 0%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in g3 single mutant, the resistance would be 75% (same as g1), but in reality, g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

In the single mutants:

- g1: 75% → so G3 is functional and provides 75% resistance.

- g3: 50% → so G1 is functional and provides 50% resistance.

But in the wild type, both are functional, providing 100% resistance. So each contributes a portion.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% → which is much lower than either. So when both pathways are knocked out, resistance is minimal.

Which would imply that without both, the plant can't resist at all, but that's not the case here (10%). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 activate different downstream genes. So when both are knocked out, the downstream genes are not expressed, leading to a more severe phenotype.

But without knowing the exact pathways, it's hard. Let's think again.

The most consistent conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor. Because G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, and it's epistatic over G1 and G3.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 are each contributing to resistance but in a way that their combined loss leads to a much more severe phenotype.

This suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. So knocking out both leads to a larger effect than either alone.

In that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but are in separate pathways. But looking at the options, none of them state that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

No, since G2 is epistatic, but G1 is TF, which is unlikely given the data.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter: G2 activates both. So in g1g3, same as g2? But in reality, g1g3 is 10% vs g2's 0. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy: each affects multiple traits. Not sure. But if G1 is epistatic, then g3's effect is seen only when G1 is present. But in data, g3 is 50% even when G1 is present (g3 is a single mutant). So that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy: each can compensate. So in the double mutant, resistance drops more. But if G1 is epistatic over G3, then knocking out G1 would show the effect of G3 only when G1 is present. But data shows g3 is 50% when G1 is present.

Hmm. I'm not fully confident, but perhaps option D is the correct one. Because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. Also, G1 being epistatic over G3 would mean that when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is more severe.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the phenotype of G3 depends on G1. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G1 knockout, which is 75%. But in the data, it's 10%, so that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each term in the options means.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only visible when G1 is present. So in the absence of G1, the effect of G3's mutation doesn't matter. So in the double mutant g1g3, the phenotype would be same as g1. But data shows g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps none of the options are perfect, but the best fit is option A.

Wait, no. Because option A says G1 is a TF, which would not fit because G2's knockout is 0%, which suggests G2 is more critical.

Wait, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is functional. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G3's knockout when G1 is present. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the explanation is that G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which are in the same pathway but contribute additively.

Wait, in the single mutants:

g1: 75% → so G3 is functional, contributing 75% of the wild-type resistance.

g3: 50% → G1 is functional, contributing 50% of wild-type resistance.

In the wild type, both G1 and G3 contribute, leading to 100%. So their functions are additive.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is less than either. So their combined loss leads to additive loss beyond either single.

In that case, perhaps the model is that G2 activates G1 and G3, each contributing to resistance. So their functions are additive.

So when G2 is knocked out, both are non-functional → 0% resistance.

When G1 is knocked out, G3 provides 75% of resistance.

When G3 is knocked out, G1 provides 50% of resistance.

Wait, but that would mean that G1's contribution is more significant than G3's. So in the wild type, G1 contributes 50%, G3 contributes 50%, totaling 100%.

In the g1 mutant: G3 provides 50%, but in data, it's 75%. Hmm, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 25%. So in the wild type, 100%. In g1: 25%, but data says 75%. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each contributes 50%, but when both are present, they work synergistically to give 100%. So in g1, G3 is present and provides 50% → but data says 75%. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF. G1 and G3 are each contributing to resistance, but when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower, suggesting they work in separate pathways. Their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype, which suggests that each contributes some resistance, and their functions are not completely overlapping.

Looking back at the options, the only one that aligns with G2 being the TF is option D and option C.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their combined knockout leads to more severe phenotype. Which matches the data.

So I'll go with option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would have the same resistance as G1's mutant, which is 75%. But in data, it's 10%. So that seems contradictory.

Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the epistasis direction wrong.

Epistasis: If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B is masked in the presence of a mutation in gene A.

So, if G1 is epistatic over G3, then the mutation in G3 has no effect when G1 is mutated.

Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So the effect of G3's mutation is not masked by G1's mutation, but the combined effect is worse.

But according to the option, G1 is epistatic towards G3. That would mean that the effect of G3's mutation is seen only when G1 is functional. So when G1 is knocked out, G3's mutation doesn't affect the phenotype. But data shows that in the double mutant, resistance is worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

I think I'm getting stuck. Based on the data, G2 is the TF because it's epistatic. The only option where G2 is a TF is options A, B, C, D. All options except option B and C have G2 as TF.

Wait, no: option A says G1 is TF. Option B: G2 is TF. Option C: G2 is TF. Option D: G2 is TF.

So for all options except A, G2 is the TF.

The correct conclusion must be that G2 is the TF.

Now, among the options, which fit.

The other part of the options is about G1 and G3's relationship.

Looking at the options:

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So their functions are overlapping. So knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype, which matches the data. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a more severe effect than either alone. Which is what we see: g1g3 is 10%, worse than 75 and 50. So that fits.

But what about the epistasis part? In option D, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 when G1 is present. But in data, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either.

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe the epistasis part isn't the key here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (not redundant), and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype.

But none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Option A: G1 is the TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But in that case, G2 is epistatic to G1, which fits the data (g1g2 is 0% same as g2). But if G1 is the TF, why is the single mutant g2 at 0%? Because G2 is epistatic, but if G1 is the TF, then G2's function depends on G1. So without G1, G2 can't function. But in the data, g2 is 0%, but g1 is 75%. So that's a contradiction.

So I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then G2 is downstream of G1.

So if G1 is a TF, then G2 is downstream.

In the single mutant g2, resistance is 0% → so G2's function is critical.

In the single mutant g1, resistance is 75% → so G2 is functional, but perhaps G3 is not. Or maybe G2 is functional but another gene is affected.

But if G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream, then in g1 mutant, G2 wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which suggests that G2 is functional. So that can't be.

Therefore, option A is invalid.

This brings me back to option D.

Even though I'm not entirely confident, based on the data, the best fit is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the data for g1g3 is 10% which is worse than either. If they're redundant, knocking out both shouldn't make it worse than either, but better than each.

No, wait, gene redundancy means that knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Because each can compensate when the other is present.

Wait, no. That's not redundancy. Redundant genes can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either alone.

So for example, if two genes each contribute 50% of the function, then in the double mutant, the function is 0%, leading to a more severe phenotype.

So in that case, g1g3 would have 0% resistance, but in data, it's 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps they are not completely redundant but contribute partially.

But I'm not making progress. I think I have to go with option A.

Wait, no! Another approach: the epistasis hierarchy.

The hierarchy of epistasis is based on where the genes function in the pathway.

In a pathway A → B → C, a mutation in A is epistatic to B and C. A mutation in B is epistatic to C.

In our case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream.

So G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

So G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, in the single mutants:

g1: G1 is not functional. So the pathway through G1 is broken. But what's the alternative? Maybe G3 is still functional and provides some resistance.

In the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So perhaps G3 alone can provide 75% resistance, but in the g3 mutant, G1 is functional and provides 50% resistance.

Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I need to model this.

Let me model that G2 is a TF activating both G1 and G3, which in turn activate resistance genes.

In the wild type, both G1 and G3 are active → high resistance.

In g1 mutant: G3 is active → providing 75% resistance.

In g3 mutant: G1 is active → providing 50% resistance.

Wait, but that would mean that G3 contributes more than G1. So when G3 is present, it provides 75% resistance. When G1 is present, 50%.

In the wild type, both are present, so resistance is 100%.

In g1g3 mutant: neither G1 nor G3 is active → 0% resistance. But data says 10%. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G2 activates a gene X, which is necessary for resistance. But that wouldn't explain the single mutant data.

Alternative model: G2 activates two separate pathways, each of which contributes to resistance. G1 is in one, G3 in another.

In the wild type, both pathways contribute to 100% resistance.

In g1 mutant: only G3's pathway is active → 75% resistance.

In g3 mutant: only G1's pathway is active → 50% resistance.

In g1g3 mutant: neither pathway is active → 0% resistance. But data says 10%. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps each pathway contributes partially.

In the wild type: 100% (G1's 75% + G3's 25%).

In g1 mutant: G3's 25% → 25% resistance.

But data says g1 is 75% → so this model doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. I think I have to make an educated guess based on the data.

The only option that has G2 as the TF and explains the epistatic relationships is option A, but I think I'm wrong.

Upon reviewing, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Their combined knockout leads to a much lower resistance, suggesting they contribute to resistance through different mechanisms.

But looking at the options, perhaps option A is not correct. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which would mean that knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Which we do see in the data. So that fits.

But how does that fit with the epistasis? G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So in the double mutant, the resistance is same as G1's mutant. But in reality, it's worse than either. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the epistasis is the other way around: G3 is epistatic over G1. Then, in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G3's mutant. But in the data, g1g3 is 10% which is worse than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit either.

I'm really not sure. Maybe the correct answer is option A.

No, I think I'll go with option D. Because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype. Even though the epistasis part is confusing, option D seems the best fit.


The question involves determining the relationships between three genes (G1, G2, G3) based on their contributions to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The experimental data shows the resistance levels of single and double mutants, and the goal is to identify the correct conclusion about gene interactions.

   - **g1**: 75% resistance (less than wild type but not completely lost).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible, indicating G2 is critical).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate susceptibility).

2. **Double mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2, suggesting G2 is epistatic over G1).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant, indicating G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2, suggesting G2 is epistatic over G3).

3. **Epistasis**:
   - G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3, as the resistance of double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) matches the resistance of g2 alone.

4. **Gene Contributions**:
   - G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, as their single mutants show reduced resistance compared to the wild type.
   - The combined knockout of G1 and G3 (g1g3) results in 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, suggesting they are not fully redundant but contribute independently to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor (TF), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2's knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, indicating G2 is the critical gene, not G1. Thus, G1 cannot be the TF.
  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter (implying co-regulation), and G3 is epistatic towards G1. This is inconsistent because the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting the idea that G1 and G3 are co-regulated.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 being the TF fits the data, pleiotropy is not supported by the resistance levels. Additionally, G1 being epistatic towards G3 does not explain why the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns with the data in several ways:
  - G2 is the TF, as it is critical for resistance (g2 has 0% resistance).
  - G1 and G3 show redundancy, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a more severe phenotype (10% resistance) than either single mutant.
  - The statement that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is less consistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 has a worse phenotype than either single mutant. However, this option is the best fit overall.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 contribute redundantly to resistance. While the epistasis relationship is less clear, option D provides the most consistent explanation for the observed resistance levels.
