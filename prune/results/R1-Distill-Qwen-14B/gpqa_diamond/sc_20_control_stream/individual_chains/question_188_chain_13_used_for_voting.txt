Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles the same. Oh wait, I think the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a three-dimensional figure with all edges equal and all angles equal. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are each 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2hl cos β) - (2kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, isn't that correct only for orthorhombic systems? Or does it apply more generally?

Wait, no, I think that formula is for when the lattice is cubic, but when the crystal is not cubic, especially when it's a rhombohedral or other non-orthogonal systems, the formula becomes more complex. Oh right, in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance formula accounts for the angles between the lattice parameters.

Wait, the formula I think is d^2 = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - (a^2 (hk (cos α) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos γ))) ) ) / (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the lattice can be considered as a cube that's been stretched along the diagonals, but with all angles equal. The unit cell has a = b = c, but angles α = β = γ which may not be 90 degrees. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, and each angle is 30 degrees.

The (111) plane has h, k, l as 1,1,1. So, I need to find d_111. I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2hl cos α) - (2kl cos α) ) ) because all the angles are equal since it's rhombohedral. Wait, because in a rhombohedral system, α = β = γ.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, a=10 Angstrom, and cos 30 degrees. Let me calculate the denominator.

First, h² + k² + l² = 1+1+1 =3.

Then, 2hk cos α. Since all angles are 30 degrees, cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 2*1*1*0.8660 = 1.732.

But wait, how many terms are there? For the rhombohedral case, all the angles are the same, so the denominator becomes:

Denominator = (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α.

So for h=k=l=1, that's 3 - 2*(1*1*0.8660)*3 terms. Wait, no, each pair (hk, hl, kl) is considered once.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Denominator = 3 - [2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30] 

Which is 3 - [ 2*0.866 + 2*0.866 + 2*0.866 ]

Each term is 2*0.866 ≈1.732. So three such terms: 1.732 *3= 5.196.

So denominator = 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the denominator is negative, which would make d^2 negative, which is impossible. That can't be happening. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2hl cos β) - (2kl cos γ) ) ]

But for rhombohedral, α=β=γ, so cos β and cos γ are the same as cos alpha. So the denominator becomes (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α.

Wait, but in the case of (111), as before, denominator is 3 - 2*(1*1)*0.866 *3.

Wait, 2*1*1 =2, multiplied by 0.866, that gives 1.732. Each of the three terms (hk, hl, kl) is 1, so each contributes 1.732. So 3*1.732 =5.196. Then 3-5.196= -2.196.

So denominator is negative, which would make d^2 negative. Which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula includes a term that squares each of the terms. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}}

But for rhombohedral, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma.

So let's plug in the numbers again. Let me recalculate.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Denominator:

(1 + 1 +1 ) - 2[ (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) )

That's 3 - 2 [ 3 * (sqrt(3)/2) ]

sqrt(3) ≈1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So 3 *0.866 ≈2.598.

So 2*2.598 ≈5.196.

So denominator is 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Hmm, negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the interatomic distance is a. Wait, wait, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length. So the interatomic distance is the same as 'a'. So a=10 Angstrom.

Wait, but maybe I shouldn't be plugging hkl=111 into that formula. Because in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the formula is different. Or maybe I should model the unit cell as a cube scaled by the angles.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the basis vectors. The unit cell vectors are a, b, c which are each of length a=10 Angstrom, and the angles between each pair is 30 degrees. So the vectors are a, b, c with |a|=|b|=|c|=10, and the angles between a and b, a and c, b and c are all 30 degrees.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1), so the reciprocal lattice vectors can be used to find the plane's spacing. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is equal to the magnitude of the vector that is the reciprocal of the sum of the basis vectors scaled by h, k, l.

Alternatively, the formula in terms of vectors is d = 1/ (| (h a^* + k b^* + l c^* ) | ), where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic system, because rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic with a=b=c.

The general formula for d_{hkl} in a triclinic system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/(a^2)) + k^2 (1/(b^2)) + l^2 (1/(c^2)) ) + (h k (cos γ)/(a b) ) + (h l (cos β)/(a c) ) + (k l (cos α)/(b c) )) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0. So substituting a = b = c = a0, and cos α = cos β = cos γ = cosθ.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) + (hk cosθ)/(a0²) + (hl cosθ)/(a0²) + (kl cosθ)/(a0²) ) )

Factor out 1/a0²:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ )

Wait that's different from what I had before. Because now the denominator has positive terms, so it can't be negative.

So using this formula, let me plug in the numbers.

h=k=l=1, a0=10 Angstrom, and cosθ=cos30=√3/2 ≈0.866.

Denominator inside the sqrt is:

(1+1+1) + (1*1 *0.866) + (1*1 *0.866) + (1*1 *0.866 )

So that's 3 + 0.866 + 0.866 + 0.866 = 3 + 3*0.866.

3*0.866≈2.598.

So 3 + 2.598 =5.598.

So denominator inside sqrt is 5.598. So sqrt(5.598)≈2.366.

Then d = 10 / 2.366 ≈4.225 Angstrom. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are around 8-10 Angstrom. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the triclinic formula.

Wait, the correct formula for d_{hkl} in a triclinic system is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( [ (h^2/a²) + (k^2/b²) + (l^2/c^2) ) + ( hk (cos γ)/(ab) ) + ( hl (cos β)/(ac) ) + ( kl (cos α)/(bc) ) ] )

In rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and angles α=β=γ=θ.

So substituting, we get:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) + (hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ)/(a0²) )

Factor out 1/a0²:

= a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ )

Wait that's the same as before. So with the numbers I have, the denominator becomes 5.598, and d is about 10 / 2.366 ≈4.225 Angstrom.

But the options are much larger. The options are 8.95, 9.08, etc.

So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I have confused the reciprocal. Let me think. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) + hk (cos γ)/(a b) + hl (cos β)/(a c) + kl (cos α)/(b c) ) } }

Alternatively, if the unit cell is rhombohedral, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another formula I recall is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos θ + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos^2 θ } }

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach is to calculate the volume of the unit cell and then compute the interplanar distance using the plane's Miller indices.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ). But I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, the volume V of the unit cell is a^3 * (sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 θ + 2 cos^3 θ)) ?

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Let me think differently.

The (111) plane in a cubic system would have d = a / sqrt(3). Since a=10, that's 10/sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 Angstrom. But in a rhombohedral system, the actual distance would be different due to the angles.

Wait, but in our first approach, using the triclinic formula, I got d=4.225, which is even smaller than 5.773. But none of the options are close to that.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another thought: maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle.

Wait, that's similar to the first formula I thought of. Let's try that.

So denominator is (3) - 2*(1+1+1)* cos30.

Wait, (h² +k² +l²) =3.

2*(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3)=6.

Multiply by cos30, which is 0.866. So 6 *0.866=5.196.

So denominator is 3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative, which can't be.

Hmm, so that can't be right. But wait, maybe it's (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which for rhombohedral is (3) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

So same as before.

But that gives a negative denominator, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or the indices are different.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the interatomic distance, but in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance is along the edges, a=10. Maybe the (111) plane's spacing is larger than a, but that doesn't seem to make sense.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral structure can be found using the formula:

d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 - 2(1 +1 +1) cos θ} }

But that's again the same as earlier, leading to 3 - 6 cos30, which is 3 -5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be right.

Wait a minute, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ) ) ), but wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be calculated using the relation:

d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2*(1*1 cos α +1*1 cos α +1*1 cos α) )

Which again leads to the same issue.

Wait, but wait. If the denominator is negative, that suggests that the plane (111) is not present or is a forbidden reflection, but that's probably beyond the scope here. So perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written differently. Let me think about the dot product between the plane normals.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by h, k, l. The interplanar distance is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors divided by the product of the basis vectors.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal vector for (111) in a cubic system would have a magnitude of 1/d, but again, in a rhombohedral system, it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ - 3 (hk + hl + kl) cos^2θ } }

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ).

So for our case, a=10, θ=30 degrees.

Compute V:

cos30 ≈0.8660.

Compute 1 -3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3.

First, 0.866^2 ≈0.75. 3*0.75=2.25.

0.866^3 ≈0.866 *0.75 ≈0.6495. 2*0.6495≈1.299.

So 1 -2.25 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.25 = 2.299 -2.25=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=0.2214.

So V=10^3 *0.2214= 2214 Angstrom^3.

But how does this relate to the interplanar distance? Hmm.

The volume V is also equal to 1/(n*d_{hkl}^2), where n= h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + ... wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

In our case, that would be 3 - 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 - 5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal: d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given. They are all around 9 Angstrom. Let me think, what if the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but with a negative denominator. Oh wait, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, in that case, denominator is 3 + 6 *0.866 ≈3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)≈2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstrom, same as before.

Still not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in considering the formula for the reciprocal. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). For this problem, perhaps the angles modify the effective 'a' for the (111) plane.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1} }

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the interplanar distance is computed using the dot product between the basis vectors.

Wait, the (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1). The reciprocal lattice vector is proportional to this. So the distance is 1 over the magnitude of the reciprocal vector, which is sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2 cosθ (1*1 +1*1 +1*1)).

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 cosθ +1*1 cosθ +1*1 cosθ) )

Which is the same as before, leading to 3 + 6 cosθ. So same problem.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) is given by d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(3) cosθ ), which would be 10 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos30).

Compute denominator: 3 +6*(0.866)= 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstrom.

Again, no match with options.

Wait, the options are around 9 Angstrom. So perhaps the formula is actually the inverse. Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but with the absolute value.

But then the denominator would be sqrt(3 - 5.196) which would require an imaginary number. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the angle is 150 degrees instead of 30? Because cos(150) is -√3/2, which would change the sign.

Wait, but the question says the angles are 30 degrees. So that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think about the general approach.

The interplanar distance d is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal space vector.

In reciprocal space, the vector for (111) is (1,1,1), but in the reciprocal lattice. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) * (1,1,1) in some form, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = 2π / |G|, where G is the vector in reciprocal space.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral lattice is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a^2, and the off-diagonal elements are a^2 cosθ.

So the metric tensor is:

[ a² a² cosθ a² cosθ ]

[ a² cosθ a² a² cosθ ]

[ a² cosθ a² cosθ a² ]

So for (111), the reciprocal lattice vector is (1,1,1), so the squared length in reciprocal space is:

g = (1)^2*a² + (1)^2*a² + (1)^2*a² + 2*(1)(1)*a² cosθ + 2*(1)(1)*a² cosθ + 2*(1)(1)*a² cosθ.

Wait, no, the metric tensor is used to compute the dot product in reciprocal space.

Wait, the metric tensor G for the real space is:

G = [ a², a² cosθ, a² cosθ ]

[ a² cosθ, a², a² cosθ ]

[ a² cosθ, a² cosθ, a² ]

The reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by G*.

But perhaps the squared length of the reciprocal vector (hkl) is (h k l) * G* * (h k l)^T.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inverse of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor G for the real lattice is:

G = a^2 [ 1, cosθ, cosθ ]

           [ cosθ, 1, cosθ ]

           [ cosθ, cosθ, 1 ]

We can write this as a matrix:

| 1  cosθ cosθ |

| cosθ 1 cosθ |

| cosθ cosθ 1 |

But scaled by a².

The inverse of G, G^{-1}, is the metric tensor for the reciprocal lattice.

The reciprocal lattice vector (h,k,l) has a squared length equal to (h,k,l) G^{-1} (h,k,l)^T.

So to find the squared length, I need to compute:

h² G11^{-1} + k² G22^{-1} + l² G33^{-1} + 2 hk G12^{-1} + 2 hl G13^{-1} + 2 kl G23^{-1}

But I'm not sure of the exact form of G^{-1}.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant of G and find the inverse.

The determinant of G is |G| = a^6 * det( [1, c, c; c, 1, c; c, c, 1] ), where c = cosθ.

The determinant of the 3x3 matrix with 1 on the diagonal and c elsewhere is:

(1)( (1)(1) - c^2 ) - c( c*1 - c^2 ) + c( c^2 - 1*c )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula for a 3x3 matrix with diagonal a, off-diagonal b.

Wait, the determinant of matrix:

| 1 c c |

| c 1 c |

| c c 1 |

is 1*(1*1 - c*c) - c*(c*1 - c*c) + c*(c*c -1*c )

= 1*(1- c²) - c*(c - c²) + c*( c² - c )

= (1 - c^2) - c^2 (1 - c) + c^2 (c -1 )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, another approach: det = (1 - c^2)(1 + 2c^2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

The determinant is:

= 1*(1*1 - c*c) - c*(c*1 - c*c) + c*(c*c -1*c )

= 1*(1 - c^2) - c*(c - c^2) + c*(c^2 - c )

= 1 - c^2 - c^2 + c^3 + c^3 - c^2

= 1 - 3c^2 + 2 c^3.

So the determinant of G is a^6 (1 -3c^2 + 2c^3 ), where c = cosθ.

So the inverse of G is (1/det) * adjugate(G).

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I can find the inverse matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the inverse can be expressed as:

G^{-1} = (1/(1 -3c² +2c^3)) * [ (1 - c²), -(c), -(c) ]

                  [ -(c), (1 - c²), -(c) ]

                  [ -(c), -(c), (1 - c²) ]

Hmm, I'm not certain. But perhaps that's the case.

So the reciprocal lattice vector (h,k,l)= (1,1,1) has a squared length of:

(h^2 +k^2 +l^2)(1 - c^2) + (hk + hl + kl)(-c)*2.

Wait, no. The squared length is computed as:

h^2 * G11^{-1} + k^2 * G22^{-1} + l^2 * G33^{-1} + 2 hk G12^{-1} + 2 hl G13^{-1} + 2 kl G23^{-1}.

Assuming G^{-1} is:

(1 - c²)/D, -(c)/D, -(c)/D

-(c)/D, (1 - c²)/D, -(c)/D

-(c)/D, -(c)/D, (1 - c²)/D

Where D = 1-3c² +2c³.

So for (1,1,1), the squared reciprocal length is:

1*(1 - c²)/D + 1*(1 - c²)/D + 1*(1 - c²)/D 

+ 2*(1)(1)*(-c)/D + 2*(1)(1)*(-c)/D + 2*(1)(1)*(-c)/D.

Which is:

3*(1 - c²)/D + 6*(-c)/D

= [3(1 - c²) -6c ] / D

= [3 -3c² -6c ] / D

Now, D is 1 -3c² +2c^3.

So putting it all together, the squared reciprocal length is [3 -3c² -6c ] / (1 -3c² +2c^3 )

Then, d^2 = 1 / (squared reciprocal length) * (a^2) )

Wait, no. Because the reciprocal lattice vectors are in reciprocal space, which is scaled by 2π/a. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by b1, b2, b3. The (hkl) plane has a distance d given by d = 2π / |G(h,k,l)|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

But perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal length is |G|, so d = 1 / sqrt(|G| ).

But in our case, G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( [3(1 - c^2) -6 c ] / (1 -3 c^2 + 2 c^3) ) )

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should plug in the numbers.

Given θ=30 degrees, c=cos30=√3/2≈0.866.

Compute numerator: 3*(1 - c^2) -6 c.

1 -c^2 =1 -0.75=0.25.

So 3*0.25=0.75.

6 c=6*0.866≈5.196.

So numerator=0.75 -5.196 ≈-4.446.

Denominator D= 1-3c² +2c^3.

c^2=0.75. 3c²=2.25. 2c^3=2*(0.866)^3≈2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So D=1 -2.25 +1.299= (1+1.299) -2.25=2.299-2.25=0.049.

So the squared reciprocal length is (-4.446)/0.049≈-90.735.

But a squared length can't be negative. So this suggests that the (111) plane is not allowed, but the question states it's present, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (2 hk cosα + 2 hl cosβ + 2 kl cosγ) )

But for rhombohedral, α=β=γ=30 degrees.

So denominator is (3) - 2*(1*1 *0.866 +1*1 *0.866 +1*1 *0.866 )

= 3 - 2*(3 *0.866) 

= 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Again, negative. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong indices. Maybe the question refers to the (100) plane? No, the question is (111).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the interatomic distance being 10 Angstrom, but in a different way. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms, which in a rhombohedral structure might be along a certain direction, not necessarily along the lattice parameter a.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance isn't 'a' but something else. So perhaps I should compute 'a' correctly.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which is the distance between two adjacent lattice points.

In a rhombohedral lattice, each atom is at a lattice point. So the nearest neighbors are along the edges, so the distance is 'a'. So the given interatomic distance is a=10 Angstrom.

So that's correct.

Wait, but then why do the options suggest a distance of around 9 Angstrom, which is close to a/sqrt(3)≈5.77, but larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

But wait, if I ignore the signs, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1} }

So in our case:

h=k=l=1, cosθ=0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstrom.

No, that's not matching.

Wait, but the options are a=10, and the interplanar distance is about 9 Angstrom. So maybe the formula is d = a * something. But how.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the inverse of the formula I used earlier.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt(1 + cosθ), but that would be 10/sqrt(1.866)=10/1.366≈7.31, which is still not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the (111) plane in a rhombohedral system is similar to a hexagonal close packing, and the interplanar distance can be computed using a different approach. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula and the correct denominator is 3 - 6 cos30, but taking the absolute value.

So 3-5.196= -2.196. Taking absolute value, 2.196.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.757 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and make a guess. Wait, the options are:

A)9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

So maybe the correct answer is B)8.95. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and instead of adding the cos terms, I should subtract them in a different way.

Wait, let me try the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But in our case, 3 - 6 *0.866 = 3-5.196= -2.196. So I take the absolute value, 2.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(2.196)=10 /1.48≈6.757.

Doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which gives 3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=approx 2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal:

d = sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) / a.

So  sqrt(3+5.196)/10= sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.863/10≈0.2863 Angstrom. No, that's way too small.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the interplanar distance formula as d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), but that's the same as earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a hexagonal system, but rhombohedral is not hexagonal.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the formula in a rhombohedral system is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * (something) )) )

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 150 degrees instead of 30. But the question says 30 degrees.

Given that I'm stuck and the options are in a certain range, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom. But I can't see how to reach it with any formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), but with cosθ being negative.

Wait, if θ is 150 degrees, cosθ=-√3/2≈-0.866.

Then denominator would be 3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866)=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.495. Still not.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

Which with cosθ=0.866 gives 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863. d=10/2.863≈3.495. No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility is that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is calculated using the same formula as in a cubic system but scaled by some factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interplanar distance using the following approach:

In a cubic system, d = a / sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2).

In a rhombohedral system, due to the angles, the effective a' is a / cosθ, increasing the distance.

Wait, but that's a guess. So for (111), d_cubic =10/sqrt(3)≈5.7735.

But in rhombohedral, the effective a' = a / cosθ =10 / 0.866≈11.547 Angstrom.

So d_rhombo =11.547 / sqrt(3)≈6.669 Angstrom. Still not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, trying that.

Denominator: 3 -2*(3)(1 -0.866)=3 -2*3*0.134=3 -0.804=2.196.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.757. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But in this case, the denominator is 3 -5.196= -2.196, which is negative, so maybe the actual formula is the reciprocal, making d = a / sqrt( (something positive) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) with the denominator taken as positive.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.757.

Hmm, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system might not be the same as 'a'. Let me think. The nearest neighbor distance in a rhombohedral structure can be found along the edges, but perhaps the actual distance is a * sqrt(1 - cosθ).

Wait, the distance between two adjacent lattice points is 'a', but the nearest atomic distance could be along the diagonal. Hmm.

Wait, the distance between atoms along the edges is 'a'. But perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest atoms are along the face diagonal or some other direction. So, perhaps the distance is a * sqrt( (1 - cosθ) ).

Wait, but this is getting me even more confused. I think I'm at a loss here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess based on the options and the fact that the correct calculation likely involves using the formula with cosθ leading to a larger denominator, making d smaller, but I'm not seeing the path.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the reciprocal space. Let me try a different approach.

The (111) plane's interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector is given by (1,1,1) in terms of the basis vectors a, b, c.

The magnitude squared of the reciprocal vector is:

| (1,1,1) |^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1*1 cosθ +1*1 cosθ +1*1 cosθ )

Which is 3 + 6 cosθ.

So | (1,1,1) | = sqrt(3 +6 cosθ).

So the interplanar distance d is 1 / | (1,1,1) | * (2π) ?

Wait, no, in reciprocal space, the magnitude is |G|= (2π/d).

So d=2π/|G|.

But in real terms, |G| is sqrt(3 +6 cosθ) ) * (2π/a).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector is:

G = (1/a)(1,1,1) in terms of the reciprocal basis.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the metric tensor.

The reciprocal lattice vector (hkl) corresponds to a plane with spacing d.

The interplanar distance d is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ) * a.

Wait, that would be d= a / sqrt(3 +6 cosθ).

Which gives d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*0.866)=10/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.495 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Given the options, perhaps I should choose option B)8.95 Angstrom. But I don't see the path to reach that.

To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and since \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3 - 6 \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \cos 30^\circ \)
\[
\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 2: Substitute values into the formula
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3 - 6(0.866)}}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the denominator
\[
3 - 6(0.866) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
\]

The denominator becomes negative, which is unphysical. This suggests that the formula may not directly apply to the (111) plane in this rhombohedral system, or that the (111) plane is a forbidden reflection. However, the question assumes the plane exists, so the calculation must proceed.

### Step 4: Interpret the result
Given the negative denominator, the absolute value is taken to avoid a negative distance. Thus:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2.196}}
\]

### Step 5: Compute the square root
\[
\sqrt{2.196} \approx 1.48
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{1.48} \approx 6.757 \, \text{Å}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula or additional considerations not accounted for in the calculation. Based on the options and the assumption that the (111) plane is valid, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
