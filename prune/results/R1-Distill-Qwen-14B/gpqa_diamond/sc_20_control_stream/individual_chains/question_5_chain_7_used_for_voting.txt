Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They also provide the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are four possible normalized eigenvectors, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think through. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured.

The operator given is P, which is a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must be something like (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as having angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So φ is zero. So direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is the component of P along n.

So the operator P·n would be the sum of the components: P·n = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z), but since n_y is zero, it's P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ. So P·n = (n_x) P_x + (n_z) P_z.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the operator P is a vector operator, like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, actually, the components Px, Py, Pz are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices.

Right, so the Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So Px = (ħ/2) σx
Similarly for Py and Pz.

So the operator in the direction n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z) = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz).

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So our operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz).

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination would be ±ħ/2, right? Because the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they become ±ħ/2.

So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). Let me denote this as (ħ/2) times (σ·n), where n is (n_x, 0, n_z).

So the eigenvalue equation is: [ (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

(ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz) has eigenvalue +1 when applied to |ψ>.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the +1 eigenvalue of the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz).

Let me write down that matrix. Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = n_x σx + n_z σz = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying by n_x and n_z and adding:

M = n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] 
= [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So, M has elements [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We need to find the eigenvector |ψ> = [a, b]^T such that M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Setting up the equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These two equations must be satisfied for non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), so the determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can solve the first equation for a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me take equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b

Similarly, equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0. Substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2.

n_x [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ n_x^2 / (1 - n_z) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (1 - n_z):

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) =0

Expand the second term: (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z² -1 +n_z
Simplify: (-n_z +n_z) = 0 → n_z² -1.

So, the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z² - 1) = 0 → n_x^2 + n_z² =1.

Which is true because n is a unit vector (n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1). So the equations are consistent, and the system is dependent. So we can use equation 1 to express a in terms of b.

So a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b

Let me represent the vector as [a, b] = b [n_x/(1 - n_z), 1]

To find the eigenvector, we can choose b as a parameter, but we need to normalize the vector.

But perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. Since n is in x-z plane, φ=0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Then, a = [sinθ / (1 - cosθ)] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting, a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the vector is [a, b] = [cot(θ/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

We can factor out b, and choose b=1 for simplicity, then normalize.

But let's find the normalized vector. Let me express it as [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So, |cot(θ/2)|² + 1 = | [ cot²(θ/2) + 1 ] | = csc²(θ/2) ) → because cot²x +1 = csc²x.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(θ/2)) ) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Let me compute that:

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).

So a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

b = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when I normalized, I pulled out sin(θ/2), so:

[ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, I should also consider the phase. Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like exactly what I have here.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our calculation, b is real, so phi is zero? Or is it possible that the eigenvector could have a phase? Wait, but the operator's eigenvectors can have any phase, but the eigenvalue equation doesn't specify the phase. So in the general case, the eigenvector could be multiplied by a phase factor e^{i phi}. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes e^{i phi}.

Wait, but in our case, when we found a and b, both were real. So in the normalized case, it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

Option D: has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but that seems different. Option A: same with hbar, but different coefficients.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the elements are the components, possibly multiplied by some factors, but overall, the vector should have magnitude 1.

In our case, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), which matches this form with phi=0. But why is there an e^{i phi} in option C?

Wait, in the eigenvalue equation, when you multiply by a phase, the eigenvector still satisfies the equation because the eigenvalue is real (since P·n is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real). So the phase can be arbitrary. So the general solution would have a phase factor, so option C would be the correct form because it includes the e^{i phi} factor.

But looking back, in our calculation, the eigenvector came out with real components. So why is there a phase factor in option C? That suggests that the eigenvector can be written in a form where the second component has a phase, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think again. The eigenvector for spin-1/2 systems along a direction n is given by a vector of the form [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ] where theta is the angle from the z-axis and phi the azimuthal angle. Since our n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so e^{i phi} would be 1. So the vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C when phi=0. So Option C is a general form that includes any phi, but in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the second term is just sin(theta/2), not multiplied by e^{i phi}.

Wait, but the question asks for the normalized eigenvector, so perhaps the answer is the general form, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is the same as the spin-up state along n. For a spin-1/2 particle, this state can be written as a superposition of the basis states |+z> and |−z> (or whatever the eigenbasis is), with coefficients depending on the direction n.

The standard parameterization for the spin-up state along n is:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−z>

So the components are [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ], which is exactly option C. Since in our case, phi=0 because n is in the x-z plane, this reduces to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], matching our earlier result.

So the correct option must be C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

So that's the general form. So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, as it lies in the x-z plane. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z).
\]

This operator has eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$, and the problem focuses on the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The corresponding eigenvector is determined by solving the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z)\right) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
(\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]

The matrix representation of $(\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z)$ is:

\[
M = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$, the equations are:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From these, the eigenvector is parameterized as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so the eigenvector simplifies to:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the general form of the eigenvector for a spin-1/2 particle aligned along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$, which is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C) (\cos(\theta/2), e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2))**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They also provide the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The options are four possible normalized eigenvectors, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think through. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured.

The operator given is P, which is a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n must be something like (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where y=0. So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as having angles θ from the z-axis and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane. So φ is zero. So direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is the component of P along n.

So the operator P·n would be the sum of the components: P·n = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z), but since n_y is zero, it's P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ. So P·n = (n_x) P_x + (n_z) P_z.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the operator P is a vector operator, like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, actually, the components Px, Py, Pz are each (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices.

Right, so the Pauli matrices are:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So Px = (ħ/2) σx
Similarly for Py and Pz.

So the operator in the direction n is (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z) = (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz).

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So our operator becomes (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz).

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination would be ±ħ/2, right? Because the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they become ±ħ/2.

So the operator is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). Let me denote this as (ħ/2) times (σ·n), where n is (n_x, 0, n_z).

So the eigenvalue equation is: [ (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

(ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get:

(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz) has eigenvalue +1 when applied to |ψ>.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the +1 eigenvalue of the matrix (n_x σx + n_z σz).

Let me write down that matrix. Let me denote the matrix as M.

M = n_x σx + n_z σz = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]] and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying by n_x and n_z and adding:

M = n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] 
= [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So, M has elements [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We need to find the eigenvector |ψ> = [a, b]^T such that M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Setting up the equations:

1. (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

These two equations must be satisfied for non-trivial solutions (a and b not both zero), so the determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can solve the first equation for a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me take equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b

Similarly, equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0. Substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2.

n_x [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ n_x^2 / (1 - n_z) ) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (1 - n_z):

n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) =0

Expand the second term: (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z² -1 +n_z
Simplify: (-n_z +n_z) = 0 → n_z² -1.

So, the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z² - 1) = 0 → n_x^2 + n_z² =1.

Which is true because n is a unit vector (n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1). So the equations are consistent, and the system is dependent. So we can use equation 1 to express a in terms of b.

So a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b

Let me represent the vector as [a, b] = b [n_x/(1 - n_z), 1]

To find the eigenvector, we can choose b as a parameter, but we need to normalize the vector.

But perhaps a better approach is to parameterize the direction n. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. Since n is in x-z plane, φ=0. So n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ.

Then, a = [sinθ / (1 - cosθ)] b.

But 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting, a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) b.

So a = cot(θ/2) b.

So the vector is [a, b] = [cot(θ/2) b, b ] = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]

We can factor out b, and choose b=1 for simplicity, then normalize.

But let's find the normalized vector. Let me express it as [ cot(θ/2), 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

So, |cot(θ/2)|² + 1 = | [ cot²(θ/2) + 1 ] | = csc²(θ/2) ) → because cot²x +1 = csc²x.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(θ/2)) ) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Let me compute that:

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2).

So a = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

b = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when I normalized, I pulled out sin(θ/2), so:

[ cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) )

So the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, I should also consider the phase. Because in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which looks like exactly what I have here.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our calculation, b is real, so phi is zero? Or is it possible that the eigenvector could have a phase? Wait, but the operator's eigenvectors can have any phase, but the eigenvalue equation doesn't specify the phase. So in the general case, the eigenvector could be multiplied by a phase factor e^{i phi}. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes e^{i phi}.

Wait, but in our case, when we found a and b, both were real. So in the normalized case, it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, as it lies in the x-z plane. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z).
\]

This operator has eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$, and the problem focuses on the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The corresponding eigenvector is determined by solving the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\hbar}{2} (\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z)\right) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle.
\]

Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
(\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z) | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]

The matrix representation of $(\sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z)$ is:

\[
M = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1$, the equations are:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From these, the eigenvector is parameterized as:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so the eigenvector simplifies to:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches the general form of the eigenvector for a spin-1/2 particle aligned along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$, which is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C) (\cos(\theta/2), e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2))**
