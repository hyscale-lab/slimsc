Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. Because of the r squared term, it's a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions. So the particle is acting like it's in a 3D harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to remember how energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator. I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, each direction (x, y, z) contributes similarly.

In one dimension, the harmonic oscillator has energy levels given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2...). In three dimensions, assuming it's a product of three independent 1D oscillators, the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, sometimes in 3D, the energy levels are described by the principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact notation, so maybe I should clarify.

The ground state would be when n_x, n_y, n_z are all zero. So n=0, and E = (0 + 3/2) ħω, which is (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when one of them is 1, so n=1. So E=(1 +3/2)=5/2 ħω. Wait, no, wait: E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, E is 3/2. If I increase one quantum number by 1, then n becomes 1, so E is (1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω. That's the first excited state. The second excited state would be n=2, so E=(2 +3/2) = 7/2 ħω. Third excited state would be n=3, E=(3 +3/2) = 9/2 ħω. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused here: for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate. The degeneracy depends on the value of n, which is n = n_x + n_y +n_z. The third excited state: wait, the ground state is n=0 (E=3/2), first excited state is n=1 (E=5/2), second is n=2, third is n=3? Or maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let me think: ground state is the lowest energy, then first excited is the next possible energy. So for each increase in n, the energy increases by ħω.

Wait, another approach: in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). So the possible energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. Each energy level has a degeneracy given by the number of ways you can write n = n_x + n_y +n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. So for example, for n=0, only one possibility (0,0,0). For n=1, three possibilities (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So the degeneracy is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n+3-1 choose 3-1) = (n+2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=0: (0+2)(0+1)/2 = 2*1/2=1. Correct. For n=1: (3)(2)/2=3. Correct. For n=2: (4)(3)/2=6. n=3: (5)(4)/2=10. So for each n, the degeneracy is (n+2)(n+1)/2.

So the question is about the third excited state. Let's think about the order of states. The ground state is n=0, E=3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state is n=1, E=5/2 ħω. Second excited state is n=2, E=7/2 ħω. Third excited state is n=3, E=9/2 ħω. So the energy is 9/2 ħω.

So for the energy value, the correct answer should have (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, option A and C have this. Options B and D have something else.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy for n=3, which is (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω and 10. That's correct for both parts. Option C has 3, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of a 3D harmonic oscillator are determined by the total quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The energy eigenvalues are given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n$ is a non-negative integer. The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, is determined by the number of ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$. This degeneracy is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

For the third excited state, the total quantum number $n$ is 3 (since the ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second to $n = 2$, and the third to $n = 3$). Substituting $n = 3$ into the energy formula:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy for $n = 3$ is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue is 10. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$**
