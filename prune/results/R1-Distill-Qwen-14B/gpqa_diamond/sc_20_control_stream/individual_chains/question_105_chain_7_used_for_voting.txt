Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes periodically, right? And this change in brightness can look similar to the effect of an exoplanet passing in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The problem is asking: if the star wasn't covered in spots, what radius of an exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do? So, in other words, we're comparing the signal from the planet to the signal from the spots.

First, I need to understand what causes the brightness variation in both cases.

When a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So the amplitude of the signal is determined by this squared ratio.

Now, the star's spots are causing a variation because when the spots rotate into and out of view, the total brightness changes. Since the spots are cooler, when they're on the visible side (like during the day for us), the star appears slightly dimmer than when they're not visible.

So how do I model the brightness variation due to the spots?

The star's total brightness without spots can be considered as L0 = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, which is 20% or 0.2.

Wait, but the spots are cooler. So each spot emits less flux. The flux from a spot is sigma * T_spot^4. The temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

But the spots are covering 20% of the star's surface. So the total flux when the spots are facing us would be lower than when they're not.

Let me think: the star's total flux without spots is L0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. When spots are visible, the flux is reduced because a fraction of the surface is emitting at a lower temperature.

The total flux when spots are present would be L spotted = L0 * (1 - f*(T_spot^4 / Teff^4)), where f is the filling factor.

Wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

The star's total flux when spots are visible is the sum of the flux from the normal areas and the spots. The normal areas are (1 - f) * 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4 / (4π) )? Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the flux per unit area.

The flux per unit area from the star's surface (without spots) is σ Teff^4. When spots are present, the average flux per unit area is (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 + f * σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

So the total flux is the integral over the surface, but since it's a sphere, it's 4π Rstar² times the average flux per area.

So total flux with spots is 4π Rstar² [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ] * σ.

Wait, but no, because each spot has a lower temperature. So the average flux is (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * (T_spot)^4, where T_spot = 5000 K.

So the total flux when spots are present is L = 4π Rstar² σ [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - 1000)^4 ].

The variation in brightness would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, but in this scenario, the star is only spotty on one hemisphere. So when the spots are on the day side (facing us), the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, the flux is higher.

Wait, no. The star is only spotty on one hemisphere, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the lower flux; when it's not, the higher flux. But wait, the rotation would carry the spots into and out of view, so the brightness variation is because of the change in the area of the spotted hemisphere visible to us.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the variation in brightness is caused by the presence of the spots on the side we observe as the star rotates. So when half of the spotted area is visible, the brightness is lower than when it's not visible.

Wait, but the problem says that the star is only spotty on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then moves away. So the brightness variation would be when the spotted hemisphere is visible (so the spot area is 20% of the star's surface), and when it's not, the brightness returns to normal.

Wait, no. The filling factor f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, so f=0.2. The spots are on one hemisphere; but when the star rotates, the spots can come into view when that hemisphere is facing us. So the brightness variation depends on whether the spots are visible or not.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. Or perhaps the other way around. Let me think.

No, because the spots are cooler. So when the spotted side is visible, the star appears dimmer. The maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing.

But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, but another approach is to model the brightness as a function of time. The star's brightness when the spots are visible is lower, and when they're not, it's higher. So the variation in brightness (the amplitude) is the difference between the brightness when the spots are fully visible and when they are not.

Wait, but what is the maximum and minimum brightness? Let me model the flux.

When the spotted hemisphere is not visible (the star's unspotted side is entirely visible to us), the flux is F0 = σ Teff^4 * 4π Rstar² / (4π) )? No, that's not right. Wait, the total flux is calculated by integrating the surface. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is just from the normal surface: F0 = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = 4π Rstar² [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - 1000)^4 ] σ.

Wait, not exactly. Because the spotted hemisphere is 20% of the surface, but the entire surface is 100% (f=0.2 is the total area covered). So when the star rotates, the spot coverage that's visible to us changes. But wait, the problem says that the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots are either fully visible (f=0.2) or not visible (f=0) from our point of view. No, that's not right. Because as the star rotates, the spots would come into view in a way that the observable spot area increases from 0 to 0.2 and back.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of it as the maximum and minimum brightness.

The maximum brightness is when the unspotted side is entirely visible (so all of the star's surface is at Teff). The minimum is when the spotted side is entirely visible, so 20% of the star's surface is at a lower temperature.

Wait, but that would only happen if the entire spot area is on the near side when the star is viewed edge-on. But in reality, when the star rotates, the spot coverage varies between 0% and 100% of the spot area being visible. Wait, no: the spots are on a single hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, 100% of the spots are visible. When the star is viewed from the other side, 0% of the spots are visible. So the flux variation is between F0 (no spots visible) to F_spotted (all spots visible).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, no: when the spots are visible, the flux is lower than F0, so the maximum is F0, and when the spots are visible, the flux is F_spotted, which is less than F0. So the amplitude is the difference between F0 and F_spotted.

But wait, let's compute the flux.

F0 = 4π Rstar² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = 4π Rstar² σ [ (1 - 0.2) * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * (5000)^4 ].

So the amplitude (ΔF) is F0 - F_spotted = 4π Rstar² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4) ) ].

Simplify:

ΔF = 4π Rstar² σ [ 6000^4 - 0.8*6000^4 -0.2*5000^4 ]

= 4π Rstar² σ [ 0.2 * 6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

= 4π Rstar² σ * 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the amplitude is this ΔF.

Now, the planet's signal would cause a dip in brightness when it transits the star. The dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2 times the total flux. Because the planet blocks Rp²/Rstar² of the star's light.

So the planet's amplitude (ΔF_planet) would be F0 * (Rp^2/Rstar^2) = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4 * (Rp²/Rstar²) = 4π σ Teff^4 Rp².

Wait, no. Let me correct.

The dip in flux when the planet transits is F_dip = (Rp^2/Rstar^2) * F0.

So the amplitude (ΔF_planet) is F0 * (Rp²/Rstar²) = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4 * (Rp²/Rstar²) ) = 4π σ Teff^4 Rp^2.

So we need to set ΔF_planet = ΔF.

So:

4π σ Teff^4 Rp^2 = 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, wait, no. Let me write the equation:

ΔF_planet = ΔF.

Which is:

4π σ Teff^4 Rp² = 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct.

ΔF is 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

ΔF_planet is 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4 (Rp²/(Rstar²)) = 4π Rstar² σ (Rp²/Rstar²) Teff^4.

Wait, no. Because when the planet transits, the flux is reduced by the area blocked, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip is F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So F0 is 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4.

So ΔF_planet = F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2 = (4π Rstar² σ Teff^4) * (Rp²/Rstar²) = 4π σ Teff^4 Rp².

Setting this equal to ΔF:

4π σ Teff^4 Rp² = 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, no. Because ΔF is 0.2 *4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Wait, perhaps I should simplify the equation.

We can cancel out 4π σ from both sides.

So:

Teff^4 Rp² = 0.2 Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

But wait, wait. Let me get the equation right.

Wait, the equation is:

4π σ Teff^4 Rp² = 0.2 * 4π Rstar² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Divide both sides by 4π σ:

Teff^4 Rp² = 0.2 Rstar² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So, we can solve for Rp²/Rstar² = [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) Rstar² ] / (Teff^4 )

But wait, Teff is 6000 K, so Teff^4 is 6000^4.

So:

Rp^2 / Rstar^2 = [ 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) Rstar² ] / (6000^4 )

Simplify the right-hand side:

= 0.2 ( (6000^4)/(6000^4) - (5000^4)/(6000^4) ) Rstar²

= 0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) Rstar^2

So, (Rp / Rstar)^2 = 0.2 (1 - (5/6)^4 )

Compute (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333.

(5/6)^2 is (25/36) ≈ 0.6944.

(5/6)^4 = (25/36)^2 ≈ (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

Then 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.10355.

Taking the square root: Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that's approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39.

Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4=625, 6^4=1296. 625/1296 = 0.482253086.

1 - 0.482253086 = 0.517746914.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.517746914 * 0.2 = 0.103549383.

So sqrt(0.103549383) is approximately 0.3218.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my setup. Because when the star is spotted, the flux variation is the difference between F0 (no spots) and F_spotted (spots covering 20% of the surface, which is when the entire spot hemisphere is visible). So the amplitude is F0 - F_spotted.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed face-on to the spot hemisphere, 100% of the spots are visible. So the flux is F_spotted = (1 - 0.2)*Teff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4, multiplied by 4pi R^2 sigma.

So the amplitude is F0 - F_spotted, which is what I calculated.

But wait, does the planet produce the same amplitude? The planet's amplitude is when it blocks part of the star, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times F0. So delta F planet is F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Setting that equal to the spot amplitude, which is F0 - F_spotted.

So the equation is correct.

Which gives Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32.

So the correct answer is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says that the star has a filling factor of 20%, meaning that the spots cover 20% of the surface. So when the star is viewed such that the spot hemisphere is facing us, 100% of the spots (20% of the surface) are visible. So the flux is F_spotted = F0 * [ (1 - 0.2) * (Teff^4) + 0.2 (T_spot^4) ] / Teff^4.

Wait, no, because F0 is 4pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So F_spotted = 4pi R^2 sigma [ (0.8 Teff^4 ) + (0.2 T_spot^4) ]

So the difference is F0 - F_spotted = 4pi R^2 sigma [ Teff^4 - 0.8 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 4pi R^2 sigma [ 0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 T_spot^4 ]

= 0.2 *4pi R^2 sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4 )

So the amplitude is this delta F.

Now, the planet's delta F is F0 * (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Setting them equal:

0.2 *4pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = 4pi R^2 sigma (Rp^2) (6000^4 )

Cancel out terms:

0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = Rp^2 (6000^4 )

So Rp^2 = 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 1 - (5000/6000)^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.51775.

So Rp^2 = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

Rp = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218 Rstar.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option D.

Hmm, but wait another thought. The problem says the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So Rstar = R_sun. The planet's radius would be about 0.32 times that, which is larger than Earth but smaller than Jupiter perhaps. But that's a side point.

So the correct answer should be D, 0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, we compare the signals caused by the planet and the spots.

### Key Analysis

1. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**  
   The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and 20% (filling factor \( f = 0.2 \)) of its surface is covered by cooler spots (\( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)). The total flux without spots is:  
   \[
   F_0 = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
   \]  
   When the spots are fully visible, the flux is reduced to:  
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ (1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right]
   \]  
   The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between \( F_0 \) and \( F_{\text{spotted}} \):  
   \[
   \Delta F_{\text{spots}} = F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}} = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.2 T_{\text{eff}}^4 - 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right]
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \Delta F_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
   \]

2. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet**  
   When a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
   \[
   \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = F_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
   \]  
   Setting \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F_{\text{spots}} \):  
   \[
   F_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2 \cdot 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \( F_0 = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \):  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{0.2 \cdot \left( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
   \]  
   Simplify \( T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 \):  
   \[
   T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4 = T_{\text{eff}}^4 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
   \]  
   Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):  
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225
   \]  
   \[
   1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \approx 0.51775
   \]  
   Substituting back:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.2 \cdot 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
   \]

3. **Conclusion**  
   The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
