Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me try to unpack the question and figure out what it's asking.

Okay, the question is about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. They each have different masses, but the masses might not be directly relevant to the calculation. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Hmm.

So, let me jot down what's given. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. Wait, I think that's the Sun's abundance for Fe and Mg relative to H.

Wait, what do those [X/Y] notation mean again? Oh right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another star, usually the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, the definition can vary. Wait, I think the standard definition is [X/Y] = log (n_X / n_Y) - log (n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log (n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) = log ( (n_X / n_Y) * (n_Y_sun / n_X_sun) ) ). So it's like the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance in the star compared to the Sun.

Wait, no, perhaps another way to think about it: [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or sometimes, it's the logarithm of the ratio compared to the same ratio in the Sun. So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

Yes, that's right. So [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of (X/Y in star) to (X/Y in Sun). So if [X/Y] is positive, that means the star has more X relative to Y than the Sun does.

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Which means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. Because log10( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) =0 → (Fe/H)_1/(Fe/H)_sun)=1 → same as the Sun.

Wait, but what's H? H is hydrogen. So for the Sun, the Fe/H ratio is given as part of the photospheric composition. The Sun's data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, let me compute that. 12 + log (nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈ approximately 3.16e-5.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's photosphere has nFe/nH as 10^(-4.5) ? Or wait, the expression is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that's  log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Hmm, but that's the number density of Fe relative to H.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, but how does this help me find the ratio of silicon in the two stars?

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no, the ratio is n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But wait, because the stars have different masses, but perhaps this is about the number density of Si in each star's photosphere.

Wait, the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, so perhaps the number densities are what matter, not the mass. Hmm.

Hmm, but wait, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I think the elemental abundances are ratios, so the mass might not directly affect the ratio of the elements. The problem gives the Sun's nFe and nMg, so perhaps we can find the n_Si for each star.

Wait, no, the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But how do I get n_Si_1 and n_Si_2?

Let me think about the given data. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(n_Si/n_Fe) - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, no, wait: [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. So in Star 1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by a factor of 10^0.3 compared to the Sun.

Wait, let me clarify. [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) ) - log10( (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) ).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 = 2 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) )

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. But maybe I can find it in terms of H.

Wait, in the Sun, we have n_Fe = 3.16e-5 * n_H.

And for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so the ratio is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Wait, but since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So that would mean that n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1. But wait, in the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun. So n_Fe_1 = 3.16e-5 * n_H_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same as in the Sun. Wait, the problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), which probably implies that the ionization conditions are okay, but perhaps the total H density is same? Hmm, maybe the H density is the same, or perhaps not. But the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, so perhaps we can assume that the H density is the same as in the Sun, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratios relative to H and then find the ratios of the elements.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So:

log10(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → so n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) ) - log10( n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

= log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

We can write n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But since n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1,

n_Si_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

But from the Sun, n_Si_sun / n_H_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ).

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's other abundances.

Wait, the Sun has n_Mg/n_H =1e-5 (since 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → 1e-5.

In the Sun, we can assume that the Mg and Si are produced in similar processes, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of the Sun's ratios.

Wait, maybe I can use the given data for Star_2 to find n_Si_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 / n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Which, for the Sun, n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-5.

So n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Which is log10( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) ) - log10( (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

So (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But from Star_2's [Mg/H]=0, n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

So substituting into the equation:

(1e-5 * n_H_2 ) / n_Si_2 ) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

We can rearrange this to find n_Si_2 = (1e-5 * n_H_2 ) / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3 ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know n_Mg_sun over n_Si_sun. Wait, perhaps I can find this ratio from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg =1e-5 * n_H_sun.

And n_Si_sun is something we need to find.

Wait, I think I can find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ? No, wait, no. The [Mg/Si]_sun would be zero by definition, because [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, wait: [X/Y]_sun is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun = 0. Because the star is the Sun, so (n_X/n_Y)_star = (n_X/n_Y)_sun → their log ratio is zero. So [Mg/Si]_sun is zero.

But wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero. So that would mean that the Sun's Mg/Si ratio is the same as the reference (which is itself), so [Mg/Si]_sun = 0.

But in the problem, the Sun's [Mg/Si] isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] using the provided data. Let me think.

Wait, in the Sun, we know n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

We also know n_Fe =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

But I don't have n_Si_sun directly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio is zero? Because Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be [Si/Fe]_sun = log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) =0. So [Si/Fe]_sun =0.

Wait, but that's just because [X/Y] for the same star is zero.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio using the given Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data is:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, nFe =3.16e-5 nH, nMg=1e-5 nH.

What about nSi? I don't have that data. Hmm. So perhaps we can't find nSi_sun directly.

Wait, maybe I can assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is a certain value, but without that data, perhaps I'll have to express things in terms of [Mg/Si]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, because [Mg/Si] is defined relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition because it's the reference point.

So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0 → so (n_Mg/n_Si) = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → which is just tautological.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

So, n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

I need to find expressions for n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 in terms of H and each other.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Which implies n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

We know n_Fe_sun is 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_1 = (3.16e-5 n_H_sun) / n_H_sun * n_H_1 → 3.16e-5 n_H_1.

Wait, that makes sense. So n_Fe_1=3.16e-5 *n_H_1.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1= log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 ) = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

We can write n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

But since n_Fe_1=3.16e-5 n_H_1, substituting:

n_Si_1 = 3.16e-5 n_H_1 * (n_Si_sun / (3.16e-5 n_H_sun)) ) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because n_Fe_sun is 3.16e-5 n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun = (n_Si_sun)/(3.16e-5 n_H_sun).

But wait, that's (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * (1/(3.16e-5)).

Let me denote A = n_Si_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_1 = 3.16e-5 n_H_1 * [ A / (3.16e-5) ) ] * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

3.16e-5 * n_H_1 * A / 3.16e-5 → n_H_1 * A.

Then multiplied by 10^0.3 → n_Si_1 = A * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, A is n_Si_sun/n_H_sun. So I can write:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate this to Star_2's data.

Now, Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun * n_H_2.

Which is n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

[ Mg/Si ]_2=0.3 → log10( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

But n_Mg_2 is 1e-5 *n_H_2.

So,

1e-5 n_H_2 / n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Rearranging:

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 n_H_2 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3 )

Hmm, but again, I don't know n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun.

Wait, but n_Mg_sun is 1e-5 n_H_sun.

So,

n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun = (1e-5 n_H_sun ) / n_Si_sun.

So,

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 n_H_2 ) / ( (1e-5 n_H_sun ) / n_Si_sun ) ) * (1 / 10^0.3 )

Simplify:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun * 1e-5 n_H_2 ) * (1 / (1e-5 n_H_sun )) ) * 10^(-0.3)

Which simplifies to:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H_2 * 10^(-0.3)

Because 1e-5 / 1e-5 =1, and n_H_2/(n_H_sun) remains.

Wait, that's similar to the expression for n_Si_1.

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 *10^0.3.

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H_2 * 10^(-0.3).

So the ratio n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H_2 *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify:

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) * (10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3) )

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) *10^(0.6).

But wait, unless n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same, this ratio won't be one.

Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify anything about the H density in the stars. Hmmm. So perhaps we can assume that the H density in both stars is the same as in the Sun, or perhaps it's the same between the two stars.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any data about the H content of the stars, so perhaps the H density is the same in both stars, which would make n_H_1 =n_H_2.

But wait, the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, which perhaps implies that the H density is the same as in the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's think differently.

Wait, if we assume that the H density in both stars is the same as in the Sun, then n_H_1 =n_H_sun, and n_H_2 =n_H_sun. Then the ratio n_H_1 /n_H_2 is 1.

But I don't think that's a valid assumption because the stars have different masses. Wait, but the H density is a number density, and the star's mass doesn't directly affect the number density in the photosphere. It's possible that both stars have the same H density, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the H density can be canceled out because it's the same in both stars. Let me see.

If n_H_1 =n_H_2, then n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = 10^(0.6) = approx 10^0.6 is about 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would fit.

But wait, if n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same, then that's the case. So the ratio is 10^(0.6) ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the H densities are the same because the problem states that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, which implies that their Fe and Mg abundances are same as the Sun relative to H. So perhaps their H abundance is same as the Sun.

Wait, but in any case, the way the problem is set up, the ratio seems to depend on 10^0.6.

Wait, 0.3 (from Star_1's [Si/Fe]) and -0.3 (from Star_2's [Mg/Si]).

Wait, in the calculation, n_Si_1 is (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H_1 *10^0.3.

n_Si_2 is (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H_2 *10^(-0.3).

So the ratio is (n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2) = (n_H_1/n_H_2) * (10^0.3 /10^(-0.3)) ) = (n_H_1/n_H_2) *10^(0.6).

But without knowing n_H_1 and n_H_2, perhaps the problem assumes that n_H_1 =n_H_2. If that's the case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured so that the H densities are the same, so n_H_1/n_H_2=1, leading to a ratio of about 4.

So the answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Understanding the notation**:  
   The abundance ratios [X/Y] represent the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y in the star compared to the Sun:  
   \[
   [X/Y] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_X/n_Y}{n_X/n_Y}_{\text{Sun}}\right)
   \]  
   A positive value indicates that the star has a higher ratio of X to Y than the Sun.

2. **Star_1's silicon abundance**:  
   For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. This means:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Additionally, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Using the Sun's photospheric composition, \( n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \), we find:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1
   \]  
   Substituting this into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_1 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]

3. **Star_2's silicon abundance**:  
   For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. The latter implies:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Using the Sun's photospheric composition, \( n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \), we find:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2
   \]  
   Substituting into the expression for [Mg/Si]_2:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{10^{0.3}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-5}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot 10^{-0.3}
   \]

4. **Ratio of silicon atoms**:  
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot 10^{-0.3}\right)}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot 10^{0.6}
   \]  
   Assuming the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2 \)), the ratio simplifies to:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
   \]

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me try to unpack the question and figure out what it's asking.

Okay, the question is about the elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. They each have different masses, but the masses might not be directly relevant to the calculation. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Hmm.

So, let me jot down what's given. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is provided: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. Wait, I think that's the Sun's abundance for Fe and Mg relative to H.

Wait, what do those [X/Y] notation mean again? Oh right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another star, usually the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, the definition can vary. Wait, I think the standard definition is [X/Y] = log (n_X / n_Y) - log (n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log (n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) = log ( (n_X / n_Y) * (n_Y_sun / n_X_sun) ) ). So it's like the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance in the star compared to the Sun.

Wait, no, perhaps another way to think about it: [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or sometimes, it's the logarithm of the ratio compared to the same ratio in the Sun. So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

Yes, that's right. So [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of (X/Y in star) to (X/Y in Sun). So if [X/Y] is positive, that means the star has more X relative to Y than the Sun does.

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Which means (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. Because log10( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) =0 → (Fe/H)_1/(Fe/H)_sun)=1 → same as the Sun.

Wait, but what's H? H is hydrogen. So for the Sun, the Fe/H ratio is given as part of the photospheric composition. The Sun's data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, let me compute that. 12 + log (nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) ≈ approximately 3.16e-5.

Wait, but wait, the Sun's photosphere has nFe/nH as 10^(-4.5) ? Or wait, the expression is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that's  log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Hmm, but that's the number density of Fe relative to H.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, but how does this help me find the ratio of silicon in the two stars?

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no, the ratio is n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But wait, because the stars have different masses, but perhaps this is about the number density of Si in each star's photosphere.

Wait, the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, so perhaps the number densities are what matter, not the mass. Hmm.

Hmm, but wait, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I think the elemental abundances are ratios, so the mass might not directly affect the ratio of the elements. The problem gives the Sun's nFe and nMg, so perhaps we can find the n_Si for each star.

Wait, no, the problem is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

But how do I get n_Si_1 and n_Si_2?

Let me think about the given data. For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(n_Si/n_Fe) - log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, no, wait: [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. So in Star 1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher by a factor of 10^0.3 compared to the Sun.

Wait, let me clarify. [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) ) - log10( (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ) ).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 = 2 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) )

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm. But maybe I can find it in terms of H.

Wait, in the Sun, we have n_Fe = 3.16e-5 * n_H.

And for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. Because [Fe/H] is 0, so the ratio is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Wait, but since [Fe/H]_1 is zero, the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So that would mean that n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1. But wait, in the Sun, n_Fe_sun = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun. So n_Fe_1 = 3.16e-5 * n_H_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0, so n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same as in the Sun. Wait, the problem says to assume LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), which probably implies that the ionization conditions are okay, but perhaps the total H density is same? Hmm, maybe the H density is the same, or perhaps not. But the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, so perhaps we can assume that the H density is the same as in the Sun, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratios relative to H and then find the ratios of the elements.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So:

log10(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) = log10(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → so n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) ) - log10( n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun )

= log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

We can write n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But since n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1,

n_Si_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

But from the Sun, n_Si_sun / n_H_sun = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ).

Wait, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's other abundances.

Wait, the Sun has n_Mg/n_H =1e-5 (since 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → 1e-5.

In the Sun, we can assume that the Mg and Si are produced in similar processes, but perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_2 in terms of the Sun's ratios.

Wait, maybe I can use the given data for Star_2 to find n_Si_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 / n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Which, for the Sun, n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-5.

So n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Which is log10( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) ) - log10( (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

So (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But from Star_2's [Mg/H]=0, n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

So substituting into the equation:

(1e-5 * n_H_2 ) / n_Si_2 ) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

We can rearrange this to find n_Si_2 = (1e-5 * n_H_2 ) / [ (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3 ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know n_Mg_sun over n_Si_sun. Wait, perhaps I can find this ratio from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg =1e-5 * n_H_sun.

And n_Si_sun is something we need to find.

Wait, I think I can find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ? No, wait, no. The [Mg/Si]_sun would be zero by definition, because [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, wait: [X/Y]_sun is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun = 0. Because the star is the Sun, so (n_X/n_Y)_star = (n_X/n_Y)_sun → their log ratio is zero. So [Mg/Si]_sun is zero.

But wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero. So that would mean that the Sun's Mg/Si ratio is the same as the reference (which is itself), so [Mg/Si]_sun = 0.

But in the problem, the Sun's [Mg/Si] isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] using the provided data. Let me think.

Wait, in the Sun, we know n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

We also know n_Fe =3.16e-5 *n_H_sun.

But I don't have n_Si_sun directly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio is zero? Because Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be [Si/Fe]_sun = log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) =0. So [Si/Fe]_sun =0.

Wait, but that's just because [X/Y] for the same star is zero.

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio using the given Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data is:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, nFe =3.16e-5 nH, nMg=1e-5 nH.

What about nSi? I don't have that data. Hmm. So perhaps we can't find nSi_sun directly.

Wait, maybe I can assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is a certain value, but without that data, perhaps I'll have to express things in terms of [Mg/Si]_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make use of the fact that in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, because [Mg/Si] is defined relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition because it's the reference point.

So for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun =0 → log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )=0 → so (n_Mg/n_Si) = (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → which is just tautological.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

So, n_Si_1 / n_Si_2.

I need to find expressions for n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 in terms of H and each other.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Which implies n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

We know n_Fe_sun is 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

So n_Fe_1 = (3.16e-5 n_H_sun) / n_H_sun * n_H_1 → 3.16e-5 n_H_1.

Wait, that makes sense. So n_Fe_1=3.16e-5 *n_H_1.

And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1= log10( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 ) = (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

We can write n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

But since n_Fe_1=3.16e-5 n_H_1, substituting:

n_Si_1 = 3.16e-5 n_H_1 * (n_Si_sun / (3.16e-5 n_H_sun)) ) * 10^0.3.

Wait, because n_Fe_sun is 3.16e-5 n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun = (n_Si_sun)/(3.16e-5 n_H_sun).

But wait, that's (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * (1/(3.16e-5)).

Let me denote A = n_Si_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Si_1 = 3.16e-5 n_H_1 * [ A / (3.16e-5) ) ] * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

3.16e-5 * n_H_1 * A / 3.16e-5 → n_H_1 * A.

Then multiplied by 10^0.3 → n_Si_1 = A * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, A is n_Si_sun/n_H_sun. So I can write:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 * 10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can relate this to Star_2's data.

Now, Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun * n_H_2.

Which is n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) * n_H_2.

[ Mg/Si ]_2=0.3 → log10( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

But n_Mg_2 is 1e-5 *n_H_2.

So,

1e-5 n_H_2 / n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Rearranging:

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 n_H_2 ) / ( (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) *10^0.3 )

Hmm, but again, I don't know n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun.

Wait, but n_Mg_sun is 1e-5 n_H_sun.

So,

n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun = (1e-5 n_H_sun ) / n_Si_sun.

So,

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 n_H_2 ) / ( (1e-5 n_H_sun ) / n_Si_sun ) ) * (1 / 10^0.3 )

Simplify:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun * 1e-5 n_H_2 ) * (1 / (1e-5 n_H_sun )) ) * 10^(-0.3)

Which simplifies to:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H_2 * 10^(-0.3)

Because 1e-5 / 1e-5 =1, and n_H_2/(n_H_sun) remains.

Wait, that's similar to the expression for n_Si_1.

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 *10^0.3.

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H_2 * 10^(-0.3).

So the ratio n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H_2 *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify:

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) * (10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3) )

= (n_H_1 / n_H_2) *10^(0.6).

But wait, unless n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same, this ratio won't be one.

Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify anything about the H density in the stars. Hmmm. So perhaps we can assume that the H density in both stars is the same as in the Sun, or perhaps it's the same between the two stars.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any data about the H content of the stars, so perhaps the H density is the same in both stars, which would make n_H_1 =n_H_2.

But wait, the problem says to consider the photospheric composition, which perhaps implies that the H density is the same as in the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's think differently.

Wait, if we assume that the H density in both stars is the same as in the Sun, then n_H_1 =n_H_sun, and n_H_2 =n_H_sun. Then the ratio n_H_1 /n_H_2 is 1.

But I don't think that's a valid assumption because the stars have different masses. Wait, but the H density is a number density, and the star's mass doesn't directly affect the number density in the photosphere. It's possible that both stars have the same H density, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the H density can be canceled out because it's the same in both stars. Let me see.

If n_H_1 =n_H_2, then n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 = 10^(0.6) = approx 10^0.6 is about 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which would fit.

But wait, if n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same, then that's the case. So the ratio is 10^(0.6) ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the H densities are the same because the problem states that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, which implies that their Fe and Mg abundances are same as the Sun relative to H. So perhaps their H abundance is same as the Sun.

Wait, but in any case, the way the problem is set up, the ratio seems to depend on 10^0.6.

Wait, 0.3 (from Star_1's [Si/Fe]) and -0.3 (from Star_2's [Mg/Si]).

Wait, in the calculation, n_Si_1 is (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H_1 *10^0.3.

n_Si_2 is (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun)*n_H_2 *10^(-0.3).

So the ratio is (n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2) = (n_H_1/n_H_2) * (10^0.3 /10^(-0.3)) ) = (n_H_1/n_H_2) *10^(0.6).

But without knowing n_H_1 and n_H_2, perhaps the problem assumes that n_H_1 =n_H_2. If that's the case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured so that the H densities are the same, so n_H_1/n_H_2=1, leading to a ratio of about 4.

So the answer would be option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided photospheric composition of the Sun. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Understanding the notation**:  
   The abundance ratios [X/Y] represent the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y in the star compared to the Sun:  
   \[
   [X/Y] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_X/n_Y}{n_X/n_Y}_{\text{Sun}}\right)
   \]  
   A positive value indicates that the star has a higher ratio of X to Y than the Sun.

2. **Star_1's silicon abundance**:  
   For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. This means:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Fe}}_1} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Additionally, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_1} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Using the Sun's photospheric composition, \( n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \), we find:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = 3.16 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1
   \]  
   Substituting this into the expression for \( n_{\text{Si}}_1 \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_1 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]

3. **Star_2's silicon abundance**:  
   For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. The latter implies:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{H}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Using the Sun's photospheric composition, \( n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}} = 1 \times 10^{-5} \), we find:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = 1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2
   \]  
   Substituting into the expression for [Mg/Si]_2:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( n_{\text{Si}}_2 \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_2}{10^{0.3}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-5}}{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot 10^{-0.3}
   \]

4. **Ratio of silicon atoms**:  
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}_{\text{Sun}}}{n_{\text{H}}_{\text{Sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2 \cdot 10^{-0.3}\right)}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2} \cdot 10^{0.6}
   \]  
   Assuming the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2 \)), the ratio simplifies to:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
   \]

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
