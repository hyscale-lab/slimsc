Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish them.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The formula, I think, is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the lifetime here is the Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE should be on the order of ħ divided by the lifetime. But wait, in the context of resolving two energy levels, the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the uncertainty to be distinguishable. Because if the uncertainty is too big, we can't tell if they're separate or not.

Let me write down the formula. The uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ / (2Δt). So, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this value. But wait, wait, actually, the energy resolution depends on the lifetime of the state. The longer the lifetime, the lower the uncertainty, so the smaller energy differences you can resolve.

But wait, the two states have different lifetimes. Hmm, how does that affect it? Oh, each state has its own uncertainty. So maybe the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? I'm not sure. Maybe I should calculate each uncertainty.

First, let's compute the uncertainty for each state.

For the first state with lifetime Δt1 = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2Δt1)
Similarly, for the second state Δt2 =1e-8 s:
ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (2Δt2)

But wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me compute the numerical values.

Wait, but the options are given in eV. So I should convert everything to eV.

1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So let's compute ħ in eV·s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s
Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 * 6.242e18 ≈ (1.05457 *6.242 )e(-34+18) = approx 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) ) eV.

Calculate denominator: 2e-9 = 2 *1e-9 = 2e-9.

So 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 /2 ) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.58e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.58e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.58/2) * 1e-7. Because 1e-16 / 1e-9 = 1e-7.

So yes, ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) eV.

Wait, 2e-8 is 2 *1e-8. So 6.58e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.58/2) * 1e-8.

Which is 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because each state has its own uncertainty, but when you measure the energy difference between two states, the uncertainty in that measurement would be related to the lifetimes of both states. Hmm.

Alternatively, when you have two states with different lifetimes, their energy uncertainties would affect the measurement resolution. But I'm not exactly sure how to combine them. Maybe the total uncertainty is the sum of each individual uncertainty.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish the two, the energy difference should be larger than the combined uncertainty of both measurements.

So the combined uncertainty would be ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but let's calculate that.

ΔE_total = 3.29e-7 eV + 3.29e-8 eV = (3.29 + 0.329) e-7 eV = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 must be greater than 3.6e-7 eV to be resolvable.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 → way smaller than needed. Not enough.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e4 e-7. So that's way larger than 3.6e-7. So yes, it's larger. So this option would be resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1e-7 → 1e-8 is 0.1 times 1e-7, which is 3.6e-7. So 0.1e-7 is 1e-8, which is less than 3.6e-7. So not enough.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I did this correctly. Because the combined uncertainty is 3.6e-7 eV, but the options give 1e-4 eV (option C) which is much larger. So that would definitely be resolvable. But are there any other possible options?

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 10000e-8 → way larger than the required 3.6e-7.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty of each state. Oh, but each state has a different uncertainty. So perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the largest individual uncertainty.

ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is about 3.3e-7. If the energy difference is bigger than this, then it's resolvable.

Looking at the options:

Which options are bigger than 3.3e-7 eV?

Option C is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 = 1e4 e-7, which is 1e4 times 1e-7. So 1e-4 is way bigger. So it's resolvable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.1e-7 → smaller than 3.3e-7. Not enough.

So the correct option is C.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the lifetime given is the lifetime of each state. So when you have two states, you can't directly apply the uncertainty principle to their individual lifetimes. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in either state.

Wait, but what if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of one of the states? Then you couldn't distinguish.

So, the energy difference must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if it's larger than both, then you can resolve it. So ΔE must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, which is larger than ΔE2 (3.29e-8 eV). So the energy difference must be larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C is larger. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 10000e-8, so way larger than 3.3e-7 which is 0.33e-6.

So yes, the correct answer must be option C.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)) and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the larger of these uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \), to ensure the two states can be resolved. Thus, \( \Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 10,000 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition for distinguishability.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) ) eV.

Calculate denominator: 2e-9 = 2 *1e-9 = 2e-9.

So 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.582 /2 ) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.58e-16 divided by 2e-9 is 6.58e-16 / 2e-9 = (6.58/2) * 1e-7. Because 1e-16 / 1e-9 = 1e-7.

So yes, ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) ) eV.

Wait, 2e-8 is 2 *1e-8. So 6.58e-16 / 2e-8 = (6.58/2) * 1e-8.

Which is 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. The uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)) and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state. For the two states with lifetimes \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), the uncertainties are:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the larger of these uncertainties, \( \Delta E_1 \), to ensure the two states can be resolved. Thus, \( \Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 10,000 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This satisfies the condition for distinguishability.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
