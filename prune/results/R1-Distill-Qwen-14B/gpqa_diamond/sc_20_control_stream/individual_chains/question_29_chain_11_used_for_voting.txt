Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me read it carefully.

The question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequence the target gene. They look at the sequences and see changes in the first exon area.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, we need to find which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function. Probably a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact. The first part: ATGTTTCTCGCT vs ATGTTCTACGCT. So in the first exon, the change is in the third and fourth nucleotides perhaps?

Wait, let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait no, let me break it down to see where the changes are. 

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: the sequence after ATG is TTCTA CGC... where the intact is TTCTC GCT. So the third and fourth nucleotides in the third codon are changed. So the first exon is the beginning. Let me see the amino acids.

The first few codons of the intact gene: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG (same), next codon is TTT (same), then CTA (Leu?), wait wait no. Let me write the exact mutations.

Looking at each codon:

Intact: 
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
...

Mutant1:
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTA (Leu)
4: CGC (Arg)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: TAC (Tyr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA
... 
Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for frameshifts or changes leading to stop codons.

Wait, but the question says that all the changes are in the beginning of the sequence, the first exon. So perhaps the mutations could cause a frameshift or a substitution that changes the amino acid but not necessarily causing a stop.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: The third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, it's CTA (Leu too, since CTA is Leu). Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg. Then fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant1 it's GCT (Ala). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the sequences.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: positions 1-20 perhaps?

Let me take a 14-mer:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, positions 4-6 in the intact are TCT (so nucleotides 4-6: T, C, T). In mutant1, they are TAC (nucleotides 4-6: T, A, C). So this changes the codon from TCT (Ser) to TAC (Tyr). So the third codon (position 3-5) in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, it's CT ACG... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, each codon is three nucleotides, so let's see the exact changes.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the mutant1's fourth codon is CGC, which is Arg. Let me count:

Intact:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT

Mutant1:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: GCT (Ala)
16-18: GGT (Gly)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
28-30: GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, so in the first few codons, the third codon (7-9) in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. Fourth codon (10-12) in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So Ala to Arg. Then fifth codon (13-15) in intact is GGT (Gly), mutant1 is GCT (Ala). So Gly to Ala.

So these are amino acid substitutions. Does that change the protein structure? Maybe, but it might not cause a loss of function. Unless it disrupts an active site or something.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to intact:

Intact starts ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAA GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, let's see the changes.

Intact: positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
Mutant2: positions 4-6: TCT (Ser) ?

Wait, no, perhaps:

Intact's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me look for where the changes are. Let me line up the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So in the third codon (7-9), intact is CTC (Leu), mutant2 is CTA (Leu). Fourth codon, intact is GCT (Ala), mutant2 is AGC (Ser). Then fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), mutant2 is TGG (Trp). So the fourth and fifth codons change, leading to different amino acids.

But again, that's substitution, not necessarily a frameshift or a stop codon.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare to intact.

Intact starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

So the third codon (7-9) in intact: CTC (Leu) becomes TTA (Leu) in mutant3. Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), becomes CGC (Arg). Fifth codon intact: GGT (Gly) becomes GCT (Ala). Then sixth codon intact is ACT (Thr), becomes TCA (Ser). Wait, maybe:

Breaking down:

Intact: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT, 22-24: GTG...

Mutant3: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: TTA (Leu), 10-12: CGC (Arg), 13-15: TGG (Trp), 16-18: TCA (Ser), 19-21: CAC (His), 22-24: TCT (Ser), 25-27: GTG (Val), etc.

Hmm, so in the first part, the codons change, but again, substitution.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, in mutant4, let me see:

Intact's sequence after ATG:

TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, perhaps the third codon (7-9) in intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), which becomes GCT in mutant4? Or perhaps no, let me see.

Wait, the exact change is:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...CTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the first part after ATG:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, codon 3: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). Codon 4: GCT (Ala) remains GCT (Ala). Codon5: GGT (Gly) becomes ACT (Thr). So, the mutant4's codon5 is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So another substitution.

Wait, but the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests we need the gene product to be non-functional. So, which mutation causes the gene to be non-functional?

Gene function could be disrupted if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift that messes up the reading frame.

Looking at the options, any of the mutants introducing a stop codon would be a candidate.

Looking for a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequences.

Looking at the mutants:

In the given sequences, the stop codon is at the end (TGA), same for all. So the stop codon hasn't changed.

So, I'm looking for a mutation that adds a stop codon earlier.

Which mutants have a new stop codon in their sequence?

Looking at the sequences of each mutant in the beginning.

Mutant 1: Let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Mutant1 sequence: ...TCGT... The end is TGA, same as intact.

Wait, perhaps in the middle: Looking for triplets.

Mutant3: Let's see after the change:

He has TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), etc. No stop codons in the middle.

Mutant4: After the change, let's see. The first change is TAC, which is Tyr. Then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again.

Wait, I'm only looking at the first part. All the given sequences have the same end, TGA. So any stop codon before that would be in the middle.

Looking for any triplet in the mutant sequences that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Mutant1: Looking at the 4th codon, CGC (Arg) then GCT (Ala), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant2: AGC (Ser) then TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), etc. No stop.

Mutant3: After TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). No stop.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp). No stop.

Hmm, none of these have an early stop codon. So perhaps the approach is to find a frameshift mutation, which would change the reading frame and lead to a truncated protein.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon, but the question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So perhaps the mutations are in the first exon.

But looking at the sequences, all the mutations seem to involve base substitutions, not deletions or insertions. So they are point mutations.

So, no frameshifts. So perhaps the question is about which substitution would disrupt the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is alternatively spliced, but since all exons are present, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene product. So, if the gene's product is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Now, a nonsense mutation would cause a premature stop, making a shorter protein which is likely non-functional.

But from the sequences, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon. So perhaps the mutations are in a critical region, like the start codon or early exons, leading to no protein or a nonfunctional one.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants have ATG, so start is intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame.

Wait, but none of the sequences have a stop codon in the middle. So maybe I'm looking for a mutation that creates a stop codon.

Looking again:

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

After the first few codons, any TAA, TAG, or TGA?

Looking, maybe not. The fourth codon is CGC (Arg), fifth is GCT (Ala), sixth is GGT (Gly). No.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. The fifth codon is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh TCT (Ser), no stop.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

At codon 7, TGT is Cys, 8 CAC is His, then TCT, etc. No stop.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No stop codons.

Hmm, so maybe another approach. Perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical region of the gene, such as the start codon or an important functional domain.

Wait, looking at the changes again:

Mutant 2: the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant2 it's AGC (Ser). Then the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant2 it's TGG (Trp). So that's two changes in a row. Maybe that disrupts a key part.

Alternatively, perhaps the first exon contains a critical region, like a signal peptide or a catalytic site.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4. Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...

Wait, the first few codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), ACT (Thr), etc.

In the intact, the third codon is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). So third codon changed from Leu to Tyr. Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's GCT (Ala). So same. Fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So Gly to Thr.

Mutant4's sequence after the first few codons: TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mutation that creates a stop codon in the same reading frame.

Wait, another angle: If the mutation is a nonsense mutation, it would introduce a stop codon somewhere in the gene, leading to a shorter protein. Looking for any of the mutants having such a triplet.

Looking again:

Mutant1: any TGA or TAA or TAG? No.

Mutant2: any? No.

Mutant3: any? No.

Mutant4: any? No.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer isn't about a stop codon. Maybe it's about disrupting the gene's function through a missense mutation in a critical region.

Wait, the question says the gene has five exons. If the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps it's in a region critical for the function. Maybe the start codon is in the first exon, but all of them have ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a new splice site, but I think the question says the gene structure is same, exons and introns are intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the target gene's sequence, so perhaps coding region.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation in the mutant sequences. Since none of them have a stop codon in the middle, maybe it's a frameshift. But all the changes are substitutions, not insertions or deletions, so no frameshift.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 4 because it changes the fifth codon in a way that could disrupt the structure. Let me see:

Intact gene: fifth codon is GGT (Gly), which is important in structures. Mutant4 changes it to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Thr is similar but has a hydroxyl group. Depending on the location, this might disrupt a structure.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 involves the start of the gene. Let me see:

Mutant4's first few codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp)... 

Wait, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is a substitution from CTC (Leu). So that's a change in the third amino acid from Leu to Tyr. Maybe that's critical.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a much shorter protein, but I don't see a stop codon.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking for the stop codon. Let me check each mutant again.

Mutant1: Does any triplet equal TGA, TAG, or TAA?

Looking through each codon:

ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No, no stop codons.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stops.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

No stops.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No stops.

Hmm. If none have a stop codon, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that changes a critical region. Maybe the question is about disrupting the gene's function, perhaps through a missense mutation if the gene is a regulatory gene or an enzyme. For example, if the mutation occurs in the active site, it might disrupt the enzyme's function.

But without knowing the specific function of the gene, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon. But since none of the mutants have that, perhaps another possibility is a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the end of the sequences provided, since the user gives a part of each. Perhaps the stop codon is still TGA, but maybe in one of the mutants, the mutation introduces an in-frame stop earlier.

Wait, for example, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after the change leads to a stop codon. Let me look.

Mutant4: ...TTTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I should look for any triplet that's a stop codon.

Mutant4's sequence after the change:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codons are: Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp...

No stop codons. Same for others.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to look for a mutation that changes the reading frame, but since all are substitutions, that's frameshift only if the number of changed bases isn't a multiple of three. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, but I'm not sure if they're in-frame or not.

Wait, each mutation is a single substitution, so each change is one base. So, each substitution doesn't change the reading frame unless it's in a multiple of three, but since each is one base, the reading frame remains the same.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site. Since the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns, perhaps the mutation is in an exon-intron boundary. But all the sequences are in the first exon, so perhaps the splice donor or acceptor site is in the first exon.

The splice donor site is at the beginning of the exon, so any mutation there could affect splicing. For example, the first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. If a mutation occurs in the splice donor site (like a GT at the beginning), it could disrupt splicing. But in the given sequences, I don't see any G to something else in the first few bases.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the first 4-6 bases in intact are TTT (Phe), in mutant4 it's TTA (Leu). So the change is from TCT to TAC? Wait, perhaps looking at the actual DNA sequence.

Wait, the question is about the coding sequence. The splice donor site is in the RNA, which is after the 5' end of the exon. So, perhaps the first few nucleotides of the exon are crucial for splicing. But in all the mutants, the sequences seem to be coding, so perhaps splicing is not affected.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about what each mutation does.

Mutant1: Changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), so same amino acid. Then GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), and GGT (Gly) to GCT (Ala). So the changes are minor.

Mutant2: Changes CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), then GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), then GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp). So two amino acid changes.

Mutant3: Changes CTC (Leu) to TTA (Leu), GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp), ACT (Thr) to TCA (Ser). So multiple changes.

Mutant4: Changes CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

Which of these mutations is more likely to disrupt the gene's function? Probably Mutant4, because it changes two amino acids in the beginning, which could be critical for the structure. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a frame shift, but I don't see any.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, but since no stop codon is present, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4, as it has a bigger change early on.

Wait, another thought: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene's product. To eliminate it, the gene product must not be functional. The best way is a null mutation, which could be a frameshift (leading to a nonfunctional protein) or a nonsense mutation (premature stop). Since none have a stop codon, perhaps the correct answer is a frameshift, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, and all are substitutions.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon downstream.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence after the initial part is:

...TACTTCTGTGGAT...

Which is: TAC TTA CTC TGT GGA T...

Wait, the codon after TAC is TTA (Leu). Then CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), etc. No stop codon.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2. Let me look back.

Mutant2's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

The changes are:

CTC GCT GGT becomes CTA AGC TGG.

So, third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth AGC (Ser), fifth TGG (Trp).

So, the third codon remains Leu, but fourth changes from Ala to Ser, fifth from Gly to Trp.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it has a TAC (Tyr) where the intact has CTC (Leu). The substitution from Leu to Tyr could disrupt the structure if Leu was in a hydrophobic region.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a change that causes the protein to misfold, thus being non-functional.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the correct answer is that the mutation in Mutant4 occurs in a way that creates a new start codon, but I don't see an ATG elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a nonsense mutation. Wait, in Mutant4's sequence, is there a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier? Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

After ATG, the codons are TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG...

No, no stop codons.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not about introducing a stop codon. Maybe the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes a Gly to a Thr. Gly is a small residue, often in turns, while Thr has a hydroxyl group. That might disrupt the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3.

Mutant3's changes are:

Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TTA (Leu) → same amino acid.

Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg).

Fifth codon: GGT (Gly) → TGG (Trp).

So, the changes are Ala → Arg and Gly → Trp. Trp is a large aromatic residue. Depending on where it is, this could disrupt the structure.

But without knowing the exact location, it's hard to tell.

Hmm.

Maybe I should think about which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product. The most likely scenario is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But since none of the given options have that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the sequences. Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after ATG, the next codons are:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), etc.

Wait, the codon after TAC is GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly) becomes GTG? Wait, no:

Wait, the sequence is TACGCTGGTGT...

So, for codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. TCA (Ser)
7. CAC (His)
8. TCT (Ser)
9. GTG (Val)
10. GAT (Asp)

Wait, fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant3 it's GTG (Val). Oh! Wait, no. Let me check the exact change.

Intact fifth codon is GGT (Gly), and in Mutant3, it's TCA (Ser) for the sixth codon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the fifth codon in Mutant3 is GGT or something else?

Wait, the intact sequence is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me look at the exact letters.

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, after ATG, the next letters are TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3 has TTCTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, perhaps the third codon (CTC) becomes TTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then GGT becomes GTG (Val), etc.

Wait, perhaps the codon after the third is CGC (Arg) in Mutant3. So, codon 4 is CGC (Arg) in Mutant3, while in intact it was GCT (Ala). So, big change.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes more critical regions, leading to a nonfunctional gene product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes the third codon from Leu to Tyr, and the fifth from Gly to Thr.

I'm still not sure, but I think the most likely correct answer is Mutant2, because in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), and the fifth from GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp). The Trp is a large residue, which might disrupt the structure if it's in a hydrophobic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because the change is in the third codon, which could be a key part of the protein.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct answer is the one that causes a frameshift, but I thought all were substitutions. Let me check the number of bases changed.

The question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." Each mutant's sequence is given as a longer string, but the only changes are single substitutions.

So, no frameshifts.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation is in the start codon, but all have ATG.

Hmm.

Wait, the correct answer is probably D) Mutant4, because in that case, the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). These changes could disrupt the structure of the protein, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). Arginine is a positively charged residue, which might disrupt the structure if Ala was in a position requiring a small, nonpolar residue.

But I'm not entirely certain. Based on the given options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the position of the mutation is more important. The first codon after the start is often critical. For example, in the first exon, maybe the third codon is in a crucial region. So, if that's changed, the protein is nonfunctional.

So, Mutant4 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Leu is a common residue, but Tyr is a bulky aromatic residue. If this is in a region that requires a small residue, it could disrupt function.

So, perhaps Mutant4 is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The gene's function can be disrupted if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or significantly alters the protein structure through amino acid substitutions.

   - No premature stop codons introduced. The changes involve amino acid substitutions, but none are likely to completely disrupt the protein's function.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `CTA` (Leu)  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution of `Trp` (a bulky aromatic residue) for `Gly` (a small residue) could disrupt the protein structure if `Gly` is in a critical position.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
     - Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. Multiple amino acid substitutions occur, but none are guaranteed to completely disrupt the protein's function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution of `Tyr` (a bulky aromatic residue) for `Leu` (a small residue) in Codon 3 could disrupt the protein's structure if `Leu` is in a critical position. Similarly, the substitution of `Thr` for `Gly` in Codon 5 could also disrupt the protein's function.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon. However, Mutant 4 has the most significant changes in critical early codons (Codons 3 and 5), which are likely to disrupt the protein's structure and function. These changes make Mutant 4 the most probable candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me read it carefully.

The question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequence the target gene. They look at the sequences and see changes in the first exon area.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, we need to find which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function. Probably a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Compare to intact. The first part: ATGTTTCTCGCT vs ATGTTCTACGCT. So in the first exon, the change is in the third and fourth nucleotides perhaps?

Wait, let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait no, let me break it down to see where the changes are. 

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: the sequence after ATG is TTCTA CGC... where the intact is TTCTC GCT. So the third and fourth nucleotides in the third codon are changed. So the first exon is the beginning. Let me see the amino acids.

The first few codons of the intact gene: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG (same), next codon is TTT (same), then CTA (Leu?), wait wait no. Let me write the exact mutations.

Looking at each codon:

Intact: 
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
...

Mutant1:
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTA (Leu)
4: CGC (Arg)
5: GCT (Ala)
6: TAC (Tyr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA
... 
Wait, perhaps I should look for where the changes are. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for frameshifts or changes leading to stop codons.

Wait, but the question says that all the changes are in the beginning of the sequence, the first exon. So perhaps the mutations could cause a frameshift or a substitution that changes the amino acid but not necessarily causing a stop.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1: The third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, it's CTA (Leu too, since CTA is Leu). Then the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg. Then fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant1 it's GCT (Ala). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the sequences.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: positions 1-20 perhaps?

Let me take a 14-mer:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, positions 4-6 in the intact are TCT (so nucleotides 4-6: T, C, T). In mutant1, they are TAC (nucleotides 4-6: T, A, C). So this changes the codon from TCT (Ser) to TAC (Tyr). So the third codon (position 3-5) in the intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, it's CT ACG... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, each codon is three nucleotides, so let's see the exact changes.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the mutant1's fourth codon is CGC, which is Arg. Let me count:

Intact:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT

Mutant1:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: GCT (Ala)
16-18: GGT (Gly)
19-21: ACT (Thr)
22-24: TCT (Ser)
25-27: GTG (Val)
28-30: GAT (Asp)
...

Wait, so in the first few codons, the third codon (7-9) in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant1 it's CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. Fourth codon (10-12) in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So Ala to Arg. Then fifth codon (13-15) in intact is GGT (Gly), mutant1 is GCT (Ala). So Gly to Ala.

So these are amino acid substitutions. Does that change the protein structure? Maybe, but it might not cause a loss of function. Unless it disrupts an active site or something.

Looking at the other mutants.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare to intact:

Intact starts ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAA GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, let's see the changes.

Intact: positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)
Mutant2: positions 4-6: TCT (Ser) ?

Wait, no, perhaps:

Intact's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me look for where the changes are. Let me line up the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So in the third codon (7-9), intact is CTC (Leu), mutant2 is CTA (Leu). Fourth codon, intact is GCT (Ala), mutant2 is AGC (Ser). Then fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), mutant2 is TGG (Trp). So the fourth and fifth codons change, leading to different amino acids.

But again, that's substitution, not necessarily a frameshift or a stop codon.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare to intact.

Intact starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

So the third codon (7-9) in intact: CTC (Leu) becomes TTA (Leu) in mutant3. Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), becomes CGC (Arg). Fifth codon intact: GGT (Gly) becomes GCT (Ala). Then sixth codon intact is ACT (Thr), becomes TCA (Ser). Wait, maybe:

Breaking down:

Intact: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT, 22-24: GTG...

Mutant3: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: TTA (Leu), 10-12: CGC (Arg), 13-15: TGG (Trp), 16-18: TCA (Ser), 19-21: CAC (His), 22-24: TCT (Ser), 25-27: GTG (Val), etc.

Hmm, so in the first part, the codons change, but again, substitution.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Intact: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, in mutant4, let me see:

Intact's sequence after ATG:

TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: TTCTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, perhaps the third codon (7-9) in intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), which becomes GCT in mutant4? Or perhaps no, let me see.

Wait, the exact change is:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...CTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the first part after ATG:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, codon 3: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). Codon 4: GCT (Ala) remains GCT (Ala). Codon5: GGT (Gly) becomes ACT (Thr). So, the mutant4's codon5 is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So another substitution.

Wait, but the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That suggests we need the gene product to be non-functional. So, which mutation causes the gene to be non-functional?

Gene function could be disrupted if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift that messes up the reading frame.

Looking at the options, any of the mutants introducing a stop codon would be a candidate.

Looking for a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequences.

Looking at the mutants:

In the given sequences, the stop codon is at the end (TGA), same for all. So the stop codon hasn't changed.

So, I'm looking for a mutation that adds a stop codon earlier.

Which mutants have a new stop codon in their sequence?

Looking at the sequences of each mutant in the beginning.

Mutant 1: Let me look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier.

Mutant1 sequence: ...TCGT... The end is TGA, same as intact.

Wait, perhaps in the middle: Looking for triplets.

Mutant3: Let's see after the change:

He has TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), etc. No stop codons in the middle.

Mutant4: After the change, let's see. The first change is TAC, which is Tyr. Then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again.

Wait, I'm only looking at the first part. All the given sequences have the same end, TGA. So any stop codon before that would be in the middle.

Looking for any triplet in the mutant sequences that is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Mutant1: Looking at the 4th codon, CGC (Arg) then GCT (Ala), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant2: AGC (Ser) then TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), etc. No stop.

Mutant3: After TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val). No stop.

Mutant4: TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp). No stop.

Hmm, none of these have an early stop codon. So perhaps the approach is to find a frameshift mutation, which would change the reading frame and lead to a truncated protein.

Wait, but all the mutations are in the first exon, but the question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So perhaps the mutations are in the first exon.

But looking at the sequences, all the mutations seem to involve base substitutions, not deletions or insertions. So they are point mutations.

So, no frameshifts. So perhaps the question is about which substitution would disrupt the gene's function.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is alternatively spliced, but since all exons are present, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene product. So, if the gene's product is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Now, a nonsense mutation would cause a premature stop, making a shorter protein which is likely non-functional.

But from the sequences, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon. So perhaps the mutations are in a critical region, like the start codon or early exons, leading to no protein or a nonfunctional one.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants have ATG, so start is intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame.

Wait, but none of the sequences have a stop codon in the middle. So maybe I'm looking for a mutation that creates a stop codon.

Looking again:

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

After the first few codons, any TAA, TAG, or TGA?

Looking, maybe not. The fourth codon is CGC (Arg), fifth is GCT (Ala), sixth is GGT (Gly). No.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. The fifth codon is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr), seventh TCT (Ser), no stop.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

At codon 7, TGT is Cys, 8 CAC is His, then TCT, etc. No stop.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No stop codons.

Hmm, so maybe another approach. Perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical region of the gene, such as the start codon or an important functional domain.

Wait, looking at the changes again:

Mutant 2: the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant2 it's AGC (Ser). Then the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant2 it's TGG (Trp). So that's two changes in a row. Maybe that disrupts a key part.

Alternatively, perhaps the first exon contains a critical region, like a signal peptide or a catalytic site.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4. Let me check.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...

Wait, the first few codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), ACT (Thr), etc.

In the intact, the third codon is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). So third codon changed from Leu to Tyr. Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's GCT (Ala). So same. Fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So Gly to Thr.

Mutant4's sequence after the first few codons: TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mutation that creates a stop codon in the same reading frame.

Wait, another angle: If the mutation is a nonsense mutation, it would introduce a stop codon somewhere in the gene, leading to a shorter protein. Looking for any of the mutants having such a triplet.

Looking again:

Mutant1: any TGA or TAA or TAG? No.

Mutant2: any? No.

Mutant3: any? No.

Mutant4: any? No.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer isn't about a stop codon. Maybe it's about disrupting the gene's function through a missense mutation in a critical region.

Wait, the question says the gene has five exons. If the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps it's in a region critical for the function. Maybe the start codon is in the first exon, but all of them have ATG.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a new splice site, but I think the question says the gene structure is same, exons and introns are intact.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the target gene's sequence, so perhaps coding region.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation in the mutant sequences. Since none of them have a stop codon in the middle, maybe it's a frameshift. But all the changes are substitutions, not insertions or deletions, so no frameshift.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant 4 because it changes the fifth codon in a way that could disrupt the structure. Let me see:

Intact gene: fifth codon is GGT (Gly), which is important in structures. Mutant4 changes it to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Thr is similar but has a hydroxyl group. Depending on the location, this might disrupt a structure.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 involves the start of the gene. Let me see:

Mutant4's first few codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp)... 

Wait, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is a substitution from CTC (Leu). So that's a change in the third amino acid from Leu to Tyr. Maybe that's critical.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a much shorter protein, but I don't see a stop codon.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking for the stop codon. Let me check each mutant again.

Mutant1: Does any triplet equal TGA, TAG, or TAA?

Looking through each codon:

ATG TTT CTA CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No, no stop codons.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stops.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG...

No stops.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No stops.

Hmm. If none have a stop codon, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that changes a critical region. Maybe the question is about disrupting the gene's function, perhaps through a missense mutation if the gene is a regulatory gene or an enzyme. For example, if the mutation occurs in the active site, it might disrupt the enzyme's function.

But without knowing the specific function of the gene, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon. But since none of the mutants have that, perhaps another possibility is a nonsense mutation in the first exon.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the end of the sequences provided, since the user gives a part of each. Perhaps the stop codon is still TGA, but maybe in one of the mutants, the mutation introduces an in-frame stop earlier.

Wait, for example, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after the change leads to a stop codon. Let me look.

Mutant4: ...TTTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I should look for any triplet that's a stop codon.

Mutant4's sequence after the change:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codons are: Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp...

No stop codons. Same for others.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach is to look for a mutation that changes the reading frame, but since all are substitutions, that's frameshift only if the number of changed bases isn't a multiple of three. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, but I'm not sure if they're in-frame or not.

Wait, each mutation is a single substitution, so each change is one base. So, each substitution doesn't change the reading frame unless it's in a multiple of three, but since each is one base, the reading frame remains the same.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a splice site. Since the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns, perhaps the mutation is in an exon-intron boundary. But all the sequences are in the first exon, so perhaps the splice donor or acceptor site is in the first exon.

The splice donor site is at the beginning of the exon, so any mutation there could affect splicing. For example, the first exon starts with ATG, which is the start codon. If a mutation occurs in the splice donor site (like a GT at the beginning), it could disrupt splicing. But in the given sequences, I don't see any G to something else in the first few bases.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So the first 4-6 bases in intact are TTT (Phe), in mutant4 it's TTA (Leu). So the change is from TCT to TAC? Wait, perhaps looking at the actual DNA sequence.

Wait, the question is about the coding sequence. The splice donor site is in the RNA, which is after the 5' end of the exon. So, perhaps the first few nucleotides of the exon are crucial for splicing. But in all the mutants, the sequences seem to be coding, so perhaps splicing is not affected.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about what each mutation does.

Mutant1: Changes the codon from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), so same amino acid. Then GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), and GGT (Gly) to GCT (Ala). So the changes are minor.

Mutant2: Changes CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu), then GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), then GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp). So two amino acid changes.

Mutant3: Changes CTC (Leu) to TTA (Leu), GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp), ACT (Thr) to TCA (Ser). So multiple changes.

Mutant4: Changes CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).

Which of these mutations is more likely to disrupt the gene's function? Probably Mutant4, because it changes two amino acids in the beginning, which could be critical for the structure. Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a frame shift, but I don't see any.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a nonsense mutation, but since no stop codon is present, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4, as it has a bigger change early on.

Wait, another thought: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene's product. To eliminate it, the gene product must not be functional. The best way is a null mutation, which could be a frameshift (leading to a nonfunctional protein) or a nonsense mutation (premature stop). Since none have a stop codon, perhaps the correct answer is a frameshift, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, and all are substitutions.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon downstream.

Wait, looking again:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence after the initial part is:

...TACTTCTGTGGAT...

Which is: TAC TTA CTC TGT GGA T...

Wait, the codon after TAC is TTA (Leu). Then CTC (Leu), TGT (Cys), etc. No stop codon.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2. Let me look back.

Mutant2's sequence:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

The changes are:

CTC GCT GGT becomes CTA AGC TGG.

So, third codon is CTA (Leu), fourth AGC (Ser), fifth TGG (Trp).

So, the third codon remains Leu, but fourth changes from Ala to Ser, fifth from Gly to Trp.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it has a TAC (Tyr) where the intact has CTC (Leu). The substitution from Leu to Tyr could disrupt the structure if Leu was in a hydrophobic region.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 leads to a change that causes the protein to misfold, thus being non-functional.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: perhaps the correct answer is that the mutation in Mutant4 occurs in a way that creates a new start codon, but I don't see an ATG elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a nonsense mutation. Wait, in Mutant4's sequence, is there a TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier? Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence:

After ATG, the codons are TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG...

No, no stop codons.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not about introducing a stop codon. Maybe the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes a Gly to a Thr. Gly is a small residue, often in turns, while Thr has a hydroxyl group. That might disrupt the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3.

Mutant3's changes are:

Third codon: CTC (Leu) → TTA (Leu) → same amino acid.

Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg).

Fifth codon: GGT (Gly) → TGG (Trp).

So, the changes are Ala → Arg and Gly → Trp. Trp is a large aromatic residue. Depending on where it is, this could disrupt the structure.

But without knowing the exact location, it's hard to tell.

Hmm.

Maybe I should think about which mutation leads to a nonfunctional gene product. The most likely scenario is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But since none of the given options have that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the sequences. Let me check again.

Looking at Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after ATG, the next codons are:

TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), TCA (Ser), CAC (His), etc.

Wait, the codon after TAC is GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly) becomes GTG? Wait, no:

Wait, the sequence is TACGCTGGTGT...

So, for codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. TCA (Ser)
7. CAC (His)
8. TCT (Ser)
9. GTG (Val)
10. GAT (Asp)

Wait, fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant3 it's GTG (Val). Oh! Wait, no. Let me check the exact change.

Intact fifth codon is GGT (Gly), and in Mutant3, it's TCA (Ser) for the sixth codon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the fifth codon in Mutant3 is GGT or something else?

Wait, the intact sequence is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me look at the exact letters.

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ...TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, after ATG, the next letters are TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3 has TTCTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, perhaps the third codon (CTC) becomes TTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then GGT becomes GTG (Val), etc.

Wait, perhaps the codon after the third is CGC (Arg) in Mutant3. So, codon 4 is CGC (Arg) in Mutant3, while in intact it was GCT (Ala). So, big change.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes more critical regions, leading to a nonfunctional gene product.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes the third codon from Leu to Tyr, and the fifth from Gly to Thr.

I'm still not sure, but I think the most likely correct answer is Mutant2, because in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), and the fifth from GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp). The Trp is a large residue, which might disrupt the structure if it's in a hydrophobic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because the change is in the third codon, which could be a key part of the protein.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct answer is the one that causes a frameshift, but I thought all were substitutions. Let me check the number of bases changed.

The question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." Each mutant's sequence is given as a longer string, but the only changes are single substitutions.

So, no frameshifts.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation is in the start codon, but all have ATG.

Hmm.

Wait, the correct answer is probably D) Mutant4, because in that case, the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). These changes could disrupt the structure of the protein, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme that can't synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). Arginine is a positively charged residue, which might disrupt the structure if Ala was in a position requiring a small, nonpolar residue.

But I'm not entirely certain. Based on the given options, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the position of the mutation is more important. The first codon after the start is often critical. For example, in the first exon, maybe the third codon is in a crucial region. So, if that's changed, the protein is nonfunctional.

So, Mutant4 changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Leu is a common residue, but Tyr is a bulky aromatic residue. If this is in a region that requires a small residue, it could disrupt function.

So, perhaps Mutant4 is the correct answer.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. The gene's function can be disrupted if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or significantly alters the protein structure through amino acid substitutions.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence provided is:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   The start codon is `ATG`, and the stop codon is `TGA` at the end.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `CTA` (Leu)  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `GCT` (Ala)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The changes involve amino acid substitutions, but none are likely to completely disrupt the protein's function.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `CTA` (Leu)  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `AGC` (Ser)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution of `Trp` (a bulky aromatic residue) for `Gly` (a small residue) could disrupt the protein structure if `Gly` is in a critical position.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TTA` (Leu)  
     - Codon 4: `GCT` (Ala) → `CGC` (Arg)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `TGG` (Trp)  
     - Codon 6: `ACT` (Thr) → `TCA` (Ser)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. Multiple amino acid substitutions occur, but none are guaranteed to completely disrupt the protein's function.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - Changes:  
     - Codon 3: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
     - Codon 5: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr)  
   - No premature stop codons introduced. The substitution of `Tyr` (a bulky aromatic residue) for `Leu` (a small residue) in Codon 3 could disrupt the protein's structure if `Leu` is in a critical position. Similarly, the substitution of `Thr` for `Gly` in Codon 5 could also disrupt the protein's function.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon. However, Mutant 4 has the most significant changes in critical early codons (Codons 3 and 5), which are likely to disrupt the protein's structure and function. These changes make Mutant 4 the most probable candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
