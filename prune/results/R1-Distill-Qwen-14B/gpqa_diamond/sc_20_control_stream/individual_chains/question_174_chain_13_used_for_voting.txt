Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

First, let's get the masses of the two fragments. Let’s denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. The problem says m1 is twice as massive as the other, so m2 = m1/2. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99M.

Substituting m2: m1 + (m1/2) = 0.99M → (3m1/2) = 0.99M → m1 = (0.99M * 2) / 3. Let me compute that. 0.99 * 2 is 1.98, divided by 3 is about 0.66M. So m1 is approximately 0.66M, and m2 is 0.33M.

Wait, but wait, 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, yes that adds up. So that makes sense.

Since the original nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me think about their velocities.

But wait, the problem is about kinetic energy. In the non-relativistic case, we can use classical mechanics. But in reality, since the fragments are likely moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects are important, so we need to calculate using special relativity.

So the question is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation of T1.

Let me recall the concepts. In classical mechanics, if two objects are moving in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, their kinetic energies can be found using (1/2)mv². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, in this case, after fission, the two fragments have some velocities. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2.

So p1 = gamma1 * m1 * v1, and p2 = gamma2 * m2 * v2. But since p1 = -p2, gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2. But the magnitudes must be equal, so |gamma1 m1 v1| = |gamma2 m2 v2|.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can find the velocities in terms of the masses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of M: E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest mass energy (m1 c² and m2 c²) plus their kinetic energies (T1 and T2). So the total energy is (m1 + m2)c² + T1 + T2 = 0.99Mc² + T1 + T2.

Since energy is conserved, 0.99Mc² + T1 + T2 = Mc² → T1 + T2 = 0.01Mc². Because 300 GeV is the initial rest mass, 0.01 * 300 GeV is 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, let me compute that again. Mc² is 300 GeV. 0.99 * 300 GeV is 297 GeV. So 300 GeV - 297 GeV is 3 GeV. So the kinetic energies add up to 3 GeV.

Now, for the momenta. The initial momentum is zero, so the total final momentum is zero. So p1 = -p2.

In terms of relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v. But because the velocities are in opposite directions, the momentum vectors are opposite, so their magnitudes are equal.

So |p1| = |p2|. Let me write the magnitudes:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But that's one equation. I also have that the kinetic energies T1 and T2 are related through their masses and velocities.

Wait, T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c², and T2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c².

I have T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, but this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find the velocities in terms of each other.

Let me think about the relationship between the velocities. Since the two fragments have different masses, their velocities won't be the same. Let's see: from p1 = p2, so gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But I also know that for each fragment, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about the fact that the kinetic energy depends on the velocity, and we can use the energy and momentum equations to find the velocities.

Wait, another approach: since the two fragments have opposite momenta, their velocities are related but depend on their masses and gamma factors. Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the velocity of the center of momentum frame, but I'm not sure that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities. Let me denote v1 and v2 as the speeds of the two fragments. Since momentum is conserved, and the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. So:

p1 = m1 gamma1 v1

p2 = m2 gamma2 v2

p1 = -p2 → m1 gamma1 v1 = -m2 gamma2 v2

But since velocity directions are opposite, let me take magnitudes:

m1 gamma1 v1 = m2 gamma2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) (gamma1 / gamma2) v1.

But m1 is twice m2, so m1/m2 = 2. So v2 = 2 (gamma1/gamma2) v1.

This seems a bit messy, but maybe I can find a ratio of velocities. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a system of equations using the conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, another thought. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the center of mass (CM) frame is the same as the initial rest frame. So in the CM frame, the two fragments move in opposite directions with velocities v1 and v2 such that their momenta cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the energy and momentum equations.

Total energy after fission: (gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c²) = E_initial + 0 (since initial nucleus is at rest and only energy comes from rest mass) → Wait, no. The initial energy is Mc², which is equal to the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, let me correct that. The initial energy is Mc². After fission, the energy is (gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c²) = Mc².

But wait, the rest mass energy of the fragments is m1 c² + m2 c² = 0.99 M c². So the sum of their rest energies is 0.99 Mc². The initial rest energy is 1.00 Mc², so the kinetic energy is 0.01 Mc², which is 3 GeV.

So, Mc² = (m1 + m2) c² + T1 + T2 → T1 + T2 = 0.01 Mc² = 3 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Now, I need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, and compare the relativistic and non-relativistic values.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to compute both and subtract.

Let me first find the correct (relativistic) T1.

To find T1, I think I need to find the velocities or the gamma factors of the fragments. But how?

Let me think about the momentum conservation again. The total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2. So, m1 gamma1 v1 = m2 gamma2 v2.

Wait, but I can express v2 in terms of v1. Since m1 is twice m2, let me write m2 = m1/2.

So m1 gamma1 v1 = (m1/2) gamma2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Let me think of another approach. Maybe express everything in terms of beta (v/c) and gamma.

Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So, p1 = gamma1 m1 beta1 c, p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Setting p1 = p2 gives:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1 = 2 m2, so substituting:

gamma1 (2 m2) beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2 → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Hmm. That's one equation.

Now, the energy equation: E1 + E2 = Mc² → (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²) ) = Mc².

Substituting m1 = 2 m2:

gamma1 (2 m2) c² + gamma2 (m2) c² = Mc².

Dividing both sides by m2 c²:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = M/(m2) c² / (m2 c²) → Wait, perhaps I should express M in terms of m2.

Wait, earlier we found that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 → m2 = 0.33 M.

So, m2 is 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 is 0.66 M.

So, substituting m2 = 0.33 M into the energy equation:

gamma1 (2 * 0.33 M) c² + gamma2 (0.33 M) c² = Mc².

Factor out 0.33 M c²:

0.33 M c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2) ) = Mc² → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = (Mc²) / (0.33 M c²) ) → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1/(0.33) → approximately 3.0303.

So, 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

Now, from the momentum equation earlier: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me think about the kinetic energies.

T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c² → (gamma1 -1) * 0.66 M c².

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c² → (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 M c².

And we know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

So, (gamma1 -1)(0.66 M c²) + (gamma2 -1)(0.33 M c²) ) = 3 GeV.

But Mc² is 300 GeV, so M c² is 300 GeV. So,

(gamma1 -1) * 0.66 * 300 GeV + (gamma2 -1) * 0.33 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Let me compute the factors:

0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV, and 0.33 * 300 = 99 GeV.

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 (gamma1 -1) + (gamma2 -1) = 3/99 → 0.030303.

Wait, 3 divided by 99 is 1/33 ≈ 0.0303.

So, 2 gamma1 - 2 + gamma2 -1 = 0.0303 → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Wait, that's the same equation as earlier: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

So that's consistent. No new info there. So I need another equation.

The other equation is from the momentum: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

But beta is v/c, so perhaps I can express beta in terms of gamma.

Remember that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Hmm, maybe I can square both sides of the momentum equation.

(2 gamma1 beta1 )^2 = (gamma2 beta2 )^2.

So 4 gamma1^2 beta1^2 = gamma2^2 beta2^2.

But beta^2 = 1 - (1/gamma^2 ), so substituting:

4 gamma1^2 (1 - 1/gamma1^2) = gamma2^2 (1 - 1/gamma2^2 )

→ 4 gamma1^2 ( (gamma1^2 -1)/gamma1^2 ) = gamma2^2 ( (gamma2^2 -1)/gamma2^2 )

Simplify:

4 (gamma1^2 -1 ) = (gamma2^2 -1 )

So,

4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² - gamma2² = 3.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303
2. 4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3

I can use substitution. From equation 1, express gamma2 in terms of gamma1: gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Substituting into equation 2:

4 gamma1² - (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )² =3.

Let me expand (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )²:

= (3.0303)^2 - 2 * 3.0303 * 2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2

= 9.1818 (approx) - 12.1212 gamma1 + 4 gamma1².

So, substituting into equation 2:

4 gamma1² - [9.1818 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1² ] =3.

Expanding:

4 gamma1² -9.1818 +12.1212 gamma1 -4 gamma1² =3.

The 4 gamma1² and -4 gamma1² cancel.

So: -9.1818 +12.1212 gamma1 = 3.

Adding 9.1818 to both sides:

12.1212 gamma1 =12.1818.

Divide both sides by 12.1212:

gamma1 ≈ 12.1818 / 12.1212 ≈ approximately 1.005.

Wait, that's interesting. So gamma1 is about 1.005. Let me compute that precisely.

12.1818 divided by 12.1212.

Let me compute this:

12.1818 ÷ 12.1212 ≈ 1.005.

So, gamma1 ≈ 1.005.

Then, gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 * 1.005 = 3.0303 - 2.01 = 1.0203.

So, gamma1 ≈ 1.005, gamma2 ≈1.0203.

Now, let's compute the velocities beta1 and beta2.

Beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)).

gamma1 = 1.005. So 1/gamma1^2 ≈ 1/(1.010025) ≈ 0.990075.

So, 1 - 0.990075 = 0.009925.

So beta1 = sqrt(0.009925) ≈ 0.099625 c. So about 9.96% the speed of light.

Similarly for beta2:

gamma2 =1.0203. So 1/gamma2^2 ≈ 1/(1.0410) ≈0.961.

1 - 0.961 = 0.039.

Beta2 = sqrt(0.039) ≈ 0.19748 c, or about 19.75% the speed of light.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check these calculations because the numbers seem a bit off.

Wait, gamma1 is 1.005, so beta1 is sqrt(1 - (1/(1.005)^2)).

(1.005)^2 is 1.010025. So 1/1.010025 is approximately 0.990074257.

So 1 - 0.990074257 ≈ 0.009925743.

Square root of that is sqrt(0.009925743) ≈ 0.099628, which is approximately 0.0996 c, so about 9.96% of c. That's correct.

Similarly for gamma2=1.0203:

1.0203 squared is approximately 1.041212.

1/1.041212 is ≈ 0.9608.

1 - 0.9608 = 0.0392.

sqrt(0.0392) ≈ 0.198, which is about 0.198 c or 19.8%.

So, that's correct.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies T1 and T2.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

m1 is 0.66 M.

So:

gamma1 =1.005, so (gamma1-1) = 0.005.

So T1 = 0.005 * 0.66 M c².

But M c² is 300 GeV, so:

0.005 * 0.66 *300 GeV = 0.005 * 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV.

Wait, that's 990 MeV. But wait, that can't be right because the total kinetic energy is only 3 GeV. Because T1 + T2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake here, because 0.66 M c² is 0.66 *300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So, T1 = (gamma1 -1) * m1 c² = (0.005) * 198 GeV = 0.99 GeV.

Similarly, for T2:

gamma2 =1.0203, so (gamma2 -1) = 0.0203.

m2 is 0.33 M → 0.33 *300 GeV =99 GeV.

So T2 = 0.0203 *99 GeV ≈ 2.0097 GeV.

Adding T1 and T2: 0.99 +2.0097≈ 3.0 GeV, which matches the earlier result.

So, the correct T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is 990 MeV.

Wait, but the options are in MeV, and the choices are a few MeV. Hmm, but 990 MeV is way larger than the options given (2,5,10,20 MeV). So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma1 and gamma2. Because the way I approached the equations might have been incorrect. Let me check again.

Wait, I set up the equations as:

Equation 1: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

Equation 2:4 gamma1^2 - gamma2^2 =3.

I substituted gamma2 =3.0303 - 2 gamma1 into equation 2, which gave me gamma1 ≈1.005. But perhaps I made a mistake in that substitution.

Wait, let me recompute that substitution:

Equation 2 after substitution:4 gamma1² - (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )^2 =3.

Let me expand (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )^2.

= (3.0303)^2 - 2*(3.0303)*(2 gamma1) + (2 gamma1)^2.

= 9.1818 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1².

So equation 2 becomes:

4 gamma1² - [9.1818 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1²] =3.

The terms 4 gamma1² and -4 gamma1² cancel.

→ -9.1818 +12.1212 gamma1 =3.

→ 12.1212 gamma1 =3 +9.1818 =12.1818.

So gamma1 =12.1818 /12.1212 ≈1.005.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, gamma1 is approximately 1.005.

But then T1 is (1.005 -1) * (0.66 *300 GeV) =0.005 *198 GeV= 0.99 GeV=990 MeV.

But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, which is 0.99 M. So the rest masses are less than the original, so some energy is released as kinetic energy, which is 3 GeV. So T1 is 0.99 GeV, which is about 990 MeV.

But the options given are way smaller, like 2,5,10,20 MeV. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

So I need to compute both the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1, then find their difference.

Wait, but if the correct T1 is 990 MeV, and the non-relativistic value is something else, then the difference could be around hundreds of MeV, but the options are only a few MeV. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma values.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV is incorrect.

Wait, let me recheck the initial setup. The initial nucleus has rest mass energy 300 GeV. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M, so 0.99 M c² is 297 GeV. So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy of the fragments is 3 GeV. So yes, T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

But wait, in the non-relativistic case, T1 and T2 would be calculated using (1/2)mv^2.

But if the velocities are significant fractions of c, then the non-relativistic approximation would be way off. So perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)mv1² and (1/2)mv2², but when using relativistic effects, the actual KE is higher, because KE in relativity increases more rapidly with velocity.

So, I need to calculate the non-relativistic T1 and compare it to the correct T1 of 0.99 GeV.

Wait, but if the correct T1 is 990 MeV and the non-relativistic T1 is much smaller, perhaps the difference is 990 MeV minus something smaller, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem in terms of the velocity of the center of mass frame. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the fragments as 99% of M, so I may have miscalculated something earlier.

Wait, the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 =0.99 M.

But when I did the calculation, I used m1=0.66 M and m2=0.33 M, which adds up to 0.99 M. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the kinetic energy. Let me re-express everything in terms of beta and the velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the energy and momentum.

Wait, another approach: because the nucleus is at rest, and the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta, their kinetic energies can be found using the following approach.

The momentum of each fragment is p = gamma m v.

But since the initial momentum is zero, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Let me denote the speed of the more massive fragment (m1) as v1, and the less massive as v2.

So, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But m1 =2 m2, so:

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm.

Another equation comes from the conservation of energy.

Total energy after fission: (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²) ) = Mc².

Substituting m1 = 2 m2, we get:

gamma1 (2 m2) c² + gamma2 (m2) c² = Mc².

Dividing both sides by m2 c²:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = M/(m2 c²) * c² → No, more accurately, it should be:

M c² = (gamma1 (2 m2) c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²).

So, M c² = m2 c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2).

But m2 = 0.33 M, so substituting:

M c² = (0.33 M c²) (2 gamma1 + gamma2).

Divide both sides by M c²:

1 = 0.33 (2 gamma1 + gamma2).

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 1 / 0.33 → approximately 3.0303.

Which is the same as before.

Now, from the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But the velocity v is related to the beta and gamma by v = beta c.

So,

beta1 = v1/c → v1 = beta1 c.

Similarly, v2 = beta2 c.

So,

2 gamma1 beta1 c = gamma2 beta2 c → 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

Now, using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1²)).

beta2 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2²)).

Substituting into the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1²) = gamma2 sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2²).

This looks a bit complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

(2 gamma1 )² (1 - 1/gamma1²) = (gamma2 )² (1 -1/gamma2²).

Expanding:

4 gamma1² (1 -1/gamma1²) = gamma2² (1 -1/gamma2²).

Simplify each term:

Left side: 4 gamma1² -4.

Right side: gamma2² -1.

So,

4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

Which brings me back to the same equation as before. So, I end up with the same two equations:

1. 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

2.4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

Which, when solving, gives gamma1 ≈1.005 and gamma2≈1.0203.

So, the calculations seem correct, which leads me to T1 being approximately 0.99 GeV or 990 MeV.

But the options are about a few MeV, which suggests that perhaps the non-relativistic approach gives a much smaller T1, so the difference would be in the hundreds of MeV.

Wait, but let me compute the non-relativistic T1.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2.

But how do I find v for each fragment?

Using conservation of momentum and energy in the non-relativistic case.

Since the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So, m1 v1 = -m2 v2 → v2 = -(m1/m2) v1.

But m1 is twice m2, so v2 = -(2 m2/m2) v1 → v2 = -2 v1.

Wait, no, wait: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v2= -(m1/m2) v1.

Since m1 =2 m2, then v2 = -(2 m2/m2) v1 = -2 v1.

Wait, but that can't be right because the velocities would be in opposite directions, which is correct.

Now, the total energy in the non-relativistic case is the sum of the kinetic energies.

The initial nucleus has only rest energy, so the sum of the kinetic energies of the fragments must come from the rest mass difference.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the change in rest mass energy (300 GeV - 297 GeV =3 GeV) is converted entirely into kinetic energy. So T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

Now, the velocities are v1 and v2 =-2 v1.

So, for the non-relativistic case, I can write the kinetic energies as:

T1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

T2 = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (2 v1 )² = (1/2) m2 (4 v1² ) = 2 m2 v1².

So,

T1 + T2 = (1/2) m1 v1² + 2 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

But m1=2 m2, so substituting m1=2 m2:

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² +2 m2 v1² =3 GeV → m2 v1² +2 m2 v1² =3 GeV →3 m2 v1² =3 GeV → m2 v1² =1 GeV.

So,

v1² = (1 GeV)/(m2).

But m2 is 0.33 M, and M c² is 300 GeV → M=300 GeV /c² → m2 =0.33*(300 GeV/c² ) =99 GeV/c².

So,

v1² = (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c² ) )= (1/99) c² → v1 = c / sqrt(99) → approximately c/9.9499 ≈0.1005 c.

So, v1 is about 0.1005 c.

Now, compute T1 non-relativistically:

T1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

m1 =2 m2 =2*(99 GeV/c² )=198 GeV/c².

v1² = (0.1005 c )² ≈ (0.0101 c²).

So,

T1=0.5 *198 GeV/c² *0.0101 c² → 0.5 *198 *0.0101 GeV → 0.5 *1.9998 GeV ≈ 0.9999 GeV → approximately 1 GeV.

Wait, but that's strange. Because earlier, in the relativistic case, T1 is about 0.99 GeV. So the non-relativistic T1 is about 1 GeV, and the correct T1 is about 0.99 GeV.

So the difference would be approximately 0.01 GeV →10 MeV.

Wait, 0.99 GeV is 990 MeV, and 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

Difference is 1000 MeV -990 MeV=10 MeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the non-relativistic T1 is approximately 1 GeV (1000 MeV), and the correct T1 is approximately 990 MeV. So the difference is 10 MeV. So the correct T1 is 10 MeV less than the non-relativistic value.

But wait, the question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1. So if correct is lower, the difference would be negative, but the options probably give the magnitude.

So the difference is about 10 MeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 10 MeV. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Problem Setup
An atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) at rest has a rest-mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \). It undergoes fission into two fragments, where the more massive fragment (\( m_1 \)) is twice as massive as the less massive fragment (\( m_2 \)). The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( 99\% \) of \( M \), i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is \( T_1 \), and we aim to find the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic values of \( T_1 \).

### Step 1: Masses of the Fragments
From the problem, \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) into the second equation:
\[
2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \implies m_2 = 0.33M, \quad m_1 = 0.66M.
\]

### Step 2: Total Kinetic Energy
The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is:
\[
m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 0.66Mc^2 + 0.33Mc^2 = 0.99Mc^2.
\]
The initial rest energy of the nucleus is \( Mc^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \). The total kinetic energy of the fragments is:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \, \text{GeV} - 0.99 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Relativistic Calculation of \( T_1 \)
Using relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by:
\[
T = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Conservation of momentum and energy leads to the following equations:
1. \( 2\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 = 3.0303 \) (from energy conservation),
2. \( 4\gamma_1^2 - \gamma_2^2 = 3 \) (from momentum conservation).

Solving these equations yields:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.005, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0203.
\]
For the more massive fragment (\( m_1 = 0.66M \)):
\[
T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1c^2 = (1.005 - 1) \times 0.66 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 0.99 \, \text{GeV} = 990 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Non-Relativistic Calculation of \( T_1 \)
In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is:
\[
T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
\]
Using conservation of momentum and energy, the velocities of the fragments are related by \( v_2 = -2v_1 \). The total kinetic energy is:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and solving for \( v_1 \), we find:
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{1}{99}c^2 \implies v_1 \approx 0.1005c.
\]
For the more massive fragment:
\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.66M \times \left(\frac{1}{99}c^2\right) = 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1000 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 5: Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The difference between the non-relativistic and relativistic values of \( T_1 \) is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1000 \, \text{MeV} - 990 \, \text{MeV} = 10 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **10 MeV**.
