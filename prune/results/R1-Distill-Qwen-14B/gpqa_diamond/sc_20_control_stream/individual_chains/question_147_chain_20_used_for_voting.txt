Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, protons and antiprotons annihilating into particles A. Oh, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The antiproton is moving slowly. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, so the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since they're annihilating, I think energy and momentum must be conserved. But the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its kinetic energy isn't too high. But wait, how does that affect the calculation?

Let me think about the conservation laws here. Let's assume that the proton is at rest because the antiproton is moving slowly. Or wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial momentum is just from the antiproton moving at a low speed. Hmm, but annihilation usually involves both particles moving. Wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial momentum is mainly due to the antiproton.

Wait, but in particle physics, often when particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other particles. In this case, two A+ and two A- are produced. So maybe the initial rest frame is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, let's clarify the setup. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So its speed v is much less than c, so maybe we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps we're supposed to consider relativistic effects because the particles produced (A) might have significant kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem is about finding the velocity of particle A. So I probably need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me write down the variables.

The initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). Each has rest mass m_p c², which I should know is about 938 MeV. But wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV, but I don't think it gives m_p. So I need to proceed without knowing m_p, but perhaps it will cancel out.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, perhaps in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity v. But since it's moving slowly, maybe v << c, so the total energy is approximately the rest energy plus some kinetic energy. But I'm not sure if this approximation is valid because the annihilation produces particles that might have significant velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me try to model this. Let's assume that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its energy is γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is much less than c, so γ is approximately 1 + (1/2)(v²/c²), but perhaps we can approximate γ as 1. That might simplify things.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, perhaps I can consider the initial momentum to be low, so the total energy of the system is approximately (m_p + m_p) c², since the kinetic energy is low. But wait, the proton has rest mass m_p, and the antiproton also has m_p. So their rest energy would be 2 m_p c², but their kinetic energy would be small. So the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c² plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton, which is small.

But when they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each A has mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Wait, but the initial rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV, which is higher than 1200 MeV. So that suggests that the initial rest energy is sufficient to produce the particles, but there will be kinetic energy as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the lab frame is such that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the initial momentum. Let me denote the proton as at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its momentum is γ m_p v, where γ is for the antiproton's speed.

After annihilation, four particles are produced: 2 A+ and 2 A-.

Assuming that the products are moving symmetrically, perhaps in opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the particles move in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

But in the lab frame, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton. So the total momentum of the products must equal that initial momentum.

Let me denote the velocity of each A as u. Wait, but if all four particles are moving, perhaps each has the same speed but different directions. But that's complicated. Maybe in this scenario, the products are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are produced symmetrically, so the total momentum is carried by two A+ and two A- in some direction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the center of mass frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame is approximately the center of mass frame. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial total momentum is small compared to the rest mass, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the initial momentum as p_initial = γ m_p v, and the total energy as E_initial = γ m_p c² + m_p c².

Then, the final energy E_final is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c², where γ_A is the Lorentz factor for their velocity u. The total energy is 4 γ_A m_A c².

Similarly, the total momentum of the final state is 4 γ_A m_A u sin(theta), but I'm not sure about the angles. Wait, perhaps the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same momentum magnitude but in different directions. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe I can make an approximation since the antiproton is moving slowly. If the antiproton's velocity is much less than c, then its gamma is approximately 1, so its momentum is m_p v. Let's assume v << c, so γ ≈ 1. Then, the initial momentum p_initial ≈ m_p v. The initial energy E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_p) c² + (1/2) m_p v², but since v is small, the kinetic energy (1/2 m_p v²) is negligible compared to the rest energy. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

After annihilation, the four A particles must carry this energy and momentum. Since the initial momentum is m_p v, the total momentum of the four A particles must be m_p v. Let's denote each A's momentum as p_A. But how are they arranged?

Wait, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving symmetrically, perhaps in pairs moving in opposite directions. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are produced symmetrically, each moving in such a way that their momenta add to the initial momentum. For example, maybe two move in one direction and two in the opposite, but that would cancel out, but that can't be right because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. Wait, but that would make their total momentum additive. But that can't be because conservation of momentum requires their momentum sum to equal the initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps each A has the same speed u and direction. But that would make the total momentum 4 p_A = m_p v. But that's only possible if u is much smaller than c. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the four A particles are moving in the same direction, so the total momentum is 4 p_A = m_p v.

But maybe it's more manageable to consider the center of mass frame, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame.

So, let's write down the conservation equations.

Energy conservation: E_initial = E_final.

E_initial = E_p + E_p̄.

E_p is the proton's energy. Since the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c².

E_p̄ is the energy of the moving antiproton. Since it's moving slowly, E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² (non-relativistic approximation). But since v is small, the kinetic energy is small, so E_p̄ ≈ m_p c².

So E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

E_final is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each has energy E_A = γ_A m_A c².

So E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c².

Setting them equal: 2 m_p c² ≈ 4 γ_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²: 2 m_p ≈ 4 γ_A m_A.

Simplify: m_p ≈ 2 γ_A m_A → γ_A ≈ m_p/(2 m_A).

We know m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c². So m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(2*300) ≈ 938/600 ≈ 1.563.

So γ_A ≈ 1.563.

Now, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²) = 1.563.

Let's solve for u.

1.563 = 1/ sqrt(1 - (u²/c²)).

Take reciprocal: 1/1.563 ≈ 0.64 = sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Square both sides: 0.4096 ≈ 1 - u²/c².

So u²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

Take square root: u ≈ sqrt(0.5904) c ≈ 0.768 c.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.77c. Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. But wait, wait. Did I make any wrong assumptions here?

Wait, I used the non-relativistic approximation for the antiproton's energy, which might not be valid if the resulting u is close to c. Because if u is about 0.77c, then the speed is significant, so maybe the approximation isn't correct.

Wait, let me check the calculation again without the non-relativistic assumption.

Wait, the initial assumption was that the antiproton's velocity is small, so perhaps the initial momentum is much smaller than its rest mass. But if the final particles are moving at 0.77c, which isn't that small, maybe the initial momentum is non-negligible. Hmm. So perhaps the approximation E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² is not valid, and I need to consider the exact relativistic expressions.

Let me redo the analysis without the approximation.

So, the initial energy E_initial is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (rest + kinetic). Since the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c².

The antiproton has energy E_p̄ = γ m_p c², where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and its momentum p_p̄ = γ m_p v.

So E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c².

So, m_p c² (1 + γ) = 4 γ_A m_A c².

Cancel c²: m_p (1 + γ) = 4 m_A γ_A.

We also have conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v.

The final momentum is p_final = 4 γ_A m_A u, assuming all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. But for simplicity, maybe I can assume that all four are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. But that's a big assumption; perhaps it's better to think that the four particles are moving symmetrically, so that their momenta sum to the initial value.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the four A particles has the same speed u but perhaps opposite directions, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that would cancel their momenta, which can't be because the initial momentum isn't zero. So perhaps all four are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, contributing to the same direction. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are produced in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions, but that would require their momenta to sum up to the initial momentum. But that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the system's center of mass (COM) frame is where the total momentum is zero. So in the COM frame, the initial particles' momenta are equal and opposite. Then, the final particles' momenta sum to zero. But this requires that the initial particles are moving towards each other, but in our problem, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. Since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with velocity v, the lab frame is not the COM frame. The COM frame would have both particles moving towards each other. But in this problem, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, so the COM frame is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to work in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving.

So, in the lab frame:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = γ m_p v.

After annihilation, the four A particles have total energy E_final = 4 γ_A m_A c², and total momentum p_final = 4 γ_A m_A u, assuming all four are moving in the same direction. But perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe each pair is moving in opposite directions, but that would require some more detailed analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta sum to the initial momentum p_initial. So, let's assume that each A has momentum p_A in the same direction. Then, 4 p_A = p_initial.

But perhaps that's an oversimplification, but let's proceed.

So, we have two equations:

1) Energy: m_p c² (1 + γ) = 4 γ_A m_A c².

2) Momentum: γ m_p v = 4 γ_A m_A u.

Let me write them without c².

Equation 1: m_p (1 + γ) = 4 m_A γ_A.

Equation 2: γ m_p v = 4 m_A γ_A u.

Hmm, but I have three variables here: γ, v, u. I need to find u. But I can express v in terms of γ. Because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) → v = c sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Alternatively, perhaps I can eliminate γ and v to find u.

Wait, let's express v from equation 2.

From equation 2: v = (4 m_A γ_A u) / (γ m_p).

But from equation 1: m_p (1 + γ) = 4 m_A γ_A → 4 m_A γ_A = m_p (1 + γ).

Substituting into equation 2:

v = [ (m_p (1 + γ) ) * u ] / (γ m_p )

Simplify: v = [ (1 + γ ) u ] / γ.

So, v = u (1 + γ) / γ = u (1/γ + 1).

Now, let's substitute v into the expression involving gamma.

We know that gamma for the antiproton is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me write v in terms of u and gamma.

v = u (1 + gamma) / gamma.

So, v = u ( (gamma + 1) / gamma ).

Let me square both sides:

v² = u² (gamma + 1)^2 / gamma².

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1 - [u² (gamma + 1)^2 ] / (gamma² c²).

But since we're working in natural units (c=1), perhaps it's easier to set c=1.

Let me set c=1 for simplicity.

Then,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2).

From equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma) =4 m_A gamma_A.

From equation 2: gamma m_p v =4 m_A gamma_A u.

Let me express v in terms of gamma and u.

v = [4 m_A gamma_A u ] / (gamma m_p )

But from equation 1, 4 m_A gamma_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

So, substituting into equation for v:

v = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) u ] / (gamma m_p ).

Simplify: v = (1 + gamma ) u / gamma.

Now, substitute this into the expression for gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2).

v = ( (1 + gamma)/gamma ) u.

So,

v^2 = [ (1 + gamma)^2 u^2 ] / gamma^2.

Substituting into gamma equation,

gamma = 1 / sqrt( 1 - [ (1 + gamma )^2 u^2 ] / gamma^2 )

= 1 / sqrt( [ gamma^2 - (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2 ] / gamma^2 )

= gamma / sqrt( gamma^2 - (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me square both sides.

gamma^2 = gamma^2 / [ gamma^2 - (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2 ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

gamma^2 [ gamma^2 - (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2 ] = gamma^2.

Divide both sides by gamma^2 (assuming gamma ≠ 0):

gamma^2 - (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2 = 1.

Rearranging:

gamma^2 - 1 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2.

But from equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma) =4 m_A gamma_A.

And from equation 1:

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ] / (4 m_A )

Let me find gamma_A in terms of gamma.

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ] / (4 m_A )

But we need to find u in terms of gamma.

Wait, but perhaps I can find u in terms of gamma, then use equation 1 to find gamma.

Wait, let me try to express u.

From equation 2:

gamma m_p v =4 m_A gamma_A u.

But from equation 1, 4 m_A gamma_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

Substituting into equation 2:

gamma m_p v = m_p (1 + gamma) u.

Cancel m_p:

gamma v = (1 + gamma) u.

So, u = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

But earlier, we found v = [ (1 + gamma) u ] / gamma.

Hmm, but substituting u from this equation into that would give:

v = [ (1 + gamma) * (gamma v / (1 + gamma)) ) ] / gamma.

Simplify: v = [ gamma v ] / gamma → v = v. Which is just an identity, so it doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe I can express u in terms of gamma and then substitute into the equation involving gamma.

We have from the gamma equation:

gamma^2 - 1 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) u^2.

And from equation 2, u = (gamma v) / (1 + gamma).

But v is also expressed in terms of u and gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should find u in terms of gamma, then substitute into the equation.

From equation 2, u = (gamma v)/(1 + gamma).

But from equation 2 substitution, v = [ (1 + gamma) u ] / gamma.

Wait, another approach: Let's use the expression for u in terms of gamma.

From equation 1: m_p (1 + gamma) =4 m_A gamma_A.

And gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²).

So,

gamma_A = sqrt(1 - u² )^{-1}.

From equation 2: gamma m_p v =4 m_A gamma_A u.

But v = (1 + gamma ) u / gamma.

Substituting into equation 2:

gamma m_p ( (1 + gamma ) u / gamma ) =4 m_A gamma_A u.

Simplify left side: m_p (1 + gamma) u.

So,

m_p (1 + gamma) u = 4 m_A gamma_A u.

Cancel u (assuming u ≠ 0):

m_p (1 + gamma) =4 m_A gamma_A.

Which is exactly equation 1. So, this doesn't add new information. Hmm. I'm going in circles.

Perhaps I should substitute gamma_A from equation 1 into the gamma equation.

From equation 1:

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ]/(4 m_A )

But gamma_A = 1/ sqrt(1 - u²).

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - u²) = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ] / (4 m_A )

=> sqrt(1 - u²) = (4 m_A ) / [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]

Squaring both sides:

1 - u² = [ 16 m_A² ] / [ m_p² (1 + gamma )² ]

So,

u² = 1 - [16 m_A² ] / [ m_p² (1 + gamma )² ]

Now, from equation 2, we have:

gamma m_p v =4 m_A gamma_A u.

But v = (1 + gamma ) u / gamma.

So,

gamma m_p [ (1 + gamma ) u / gamma ] =4 m_A gamma_A u.

Simplify:

m_p (1 + gamma ) u =4 m_A gamma_A u.

Cancel u:

m_p (1 + gamma ) =4 m_A gamma_A.

Which is equation 1 again. So, no new info.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to express everything in terms of gamma and then solve for gamma.

We have:

From equation 1: gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]/(4 m_A )

And gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - u²).

From equation 2:

v = [ (1 + gamma ) u ] / gamma.

But v can also be expressed in terms of gamma: v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²) → v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So,

v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

But from equation 2, v = [ (1 + gamma ) u ] / gamma.

So,

sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² ) = [ (1 + gamma ) u ] / gamma.

Let me square both sides:

1 - 1/gamma² = [ (1 + gamma )² u² ] / gamma².

Multiply both sides by gamma²:

gamma² -1 = (1 + gamma )² u².

But from equation 1, we have gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]/(4 m_A )

And sqrt(1 - u² ) = (4 m_A )/(m_p (1 + gamma )) )

Wait, earlier I had:

sqrt(1 - u² ) = (4 m_A ) / [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]

So, 1 - u² = [16 m_A² ] / [ m_p² (1 + gamma )² ]

So,

u² = 1 - [16 m_A² ] / [ m_p² (1 + gamma )² ]

Let me substitute u² into the equation gamma² -1 = (1 + gamma )² u².

So,

gamma² -1 = (1 + gamma )² [ 1 - (16 m_A^2)/(m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2) ) ]

Hmm, that's complicated. Let me compute the right-hand side.

= (1 + gamma )^2 * [ 1 - (16 m_A² )/( m_p^2 (1 + gamma )^2 ) ]

= (1 + gamma )^2 - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

So,

gamma² - 1 = (1 + gamma )^2 - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Expand (1 + gamma )^2: 1 + 2 gamma + gamma².

So,

gamma² -1 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Subtract gamma² from both sides:

-1 = 1 + 2 gamma - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Bring all terms to one side:

-1 -1 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 0 → -2 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )=0

Rearranged:

(16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 2 (1 + gamma )

So,

gamma = [ (16 m_A^2 )/( 2 m_p^2 ) ] -1 = [8 m_A² / m_p² ] -1.

Now, plug in the numbers.

m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

So,

gamma = [8*(300)^2 ] / (938)^2 ) - 1.

Compute numerator: 8 * 90,000 = 720,000 (since 300^2=90,000).

Denominator: 938^2 ≈ 880, a thousand? Let me compute 938 * 938.

Calculate 938^2:

= (900 + 38)^2 = 900² + 2 * 900 * 38 + 38² = 810000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 810000 + 68400 = 878400 + 1444 = 879844.

So,

gamma = (720000) / 879844 - 1.

Compute 720000 / 879844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 - 1 = -0.182.

Wait, that can't be right because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1 for moving particles. I must have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let's go back.

We had:

gamma² - 1 = (1 + gamma )² - (16 m_A^2)/( m_p^2 )

So,

gamma² -1 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma²) - (16 m_A² )/(m_p² )

So,

gamma² -1 = gamma² + 2 gamma +1 - (16 m_A² )/( m_p² )

Subtract gamma² from both sides:

-1 = 2 gamma + 1 - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Rearrange:

2 gamma + 1 + 1 = (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Wait, no:

-1 = 2 gamma + 1 - (16 m_A²)/(m_p² )

Bring all terms to one side:

-1 -1 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )=0

Which is:

-2 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) =0.

Then,

(16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 2 (1 + gamma )

Divide both sides by 2:

(8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 1 + gamma.

So,

gamma = (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) -1.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. So the calculation should be:

(8 * (300)^2 ) / (938)^2 ) - 1.

Compute 8*(300)^2 = 8*90000 = 720,000.

938^2 is 879,844.

So,

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

Wait, that can't be right. Gamma can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in the algebra somewhere. Let me check the steps again.

Going back to:

gamma^2 -1 = (1 + gamma )^2 - (16 m_A² )/( m_p^2 )

So,

gamma^2 -1 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Subtract gamma^2 from both sides:

-1 = 1 + 2 gamma - (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )

Now, move all terms to left:

-1 -1 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )=0 → -2 -2 gamma + (16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 )=0.

Then,

(16 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 2 (1 + gamma )

Divide both sides by 2:

(8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) = 1 + gamma.

Ah, yes, that's correct. So,

gamma = (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) - 1.

Wait, but 8 m_A² is 8*(300)^2=8*90,000=720,000. m_p^2 is (938)^2=879,844.

So,

8 m_A^2 / m_p^2 = 720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

But gamma can't be negative. So something's wrong here. So perhaps my initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Or perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Maybe only two of them are moving in the same direction. Alternatively, maybe they are moving in pairs, leading to a net momentum.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation where the antiproton's velocity is slow is not justifiable, leading to a contradiction when using the exact equations. So perhaps I should try a different approach.

Wait, let's think about this differently. The initial rest energy is 2 m_p c², and the rest energy of the products is 4 m_A c². The initial rest energy (2*938=1876 MeV) is more than the products' rest energy (4*300=1200 MeV). So, some of the rest energy is converted into kinetic energy, which allows the products to move.

But how?

Wait, perhaps using the conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame would be easier. Because in the COM frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the final particles must have zero total momentum.

In the COM frame, the initial energy is the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton.

The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c².

The antiproton's energy is gamma m_p c².

So, initial energy in COM frame: E_com = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The COM frame's energy is the total rest energy of the system.

Wait, but to find the COM energy, perhaps it's easier to compute it as sqrt( (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2 ) ).

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest (E_p = m_p c², p_p = 0), and the antiproton has E_p̄ = gamma m_p c², p_p̄ = gamma m_p v.

So, the total energy is E_total = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The total momentum is p_total = gamma m_p v.

The COM energy is then sqrt( (E_total c)^2 - (p_total c^2 )^2 ) / c^2.

Wait, the formula is E_com^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

So,

E_com^2 = (m_p c² + gamma m_p c² )² - (gamma m_p v c )^2.

But v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

So,

v c = c^2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )

Thus,

E_com^2 = (m_p c² (1 + gamma ))^2 - (gamma m_p c^2 sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 ))^2.

Factor out (m_p c^2 )^2:

= (m_p c^2 )^2 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² (1 - 1/gamma² ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - gamma² (1 - 1/gamma^2 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 + 1.

= 2 + 2 gamma.

So,

E_com^2 = (m_p c² )^2 * 2 (1 + gamma )

Thus,

E_com = m_p c² sqrt( 2 (1 + gamma ) )

But in the COM frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the final particles must have zero total momentum. So, for the four A particles, their momenta must cancel each other.

But each A has the same mass, so perhaps they are moving symmetrically. For example, two A+ moving in one direction and two A- moving in the opposite direction, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps they form two pairs moving in opposite directions, each pair contributing equal and opposite momenta.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that in the COM frame, each A particle has the same speed and opposite directions so that their momenta cancel. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since all four A particles are identical in mass, perhaps they are each moving with the same speed u, but in opposite directions such that their momenta cancel. But this would require that their velocities are such that the vector sum is zero.

Wait, perhaps each pair is moving in opposite directions with the same speed. So, for example, two A+ moving in +x and two A- moving in -x, each with speed u. Then, their momenta sum to zero. But that's just a guess.

In that case, the total momentum is zero, which matches the COM frame.

The energy in the COM frame is E_com =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², and four of them.

So,

E_com =4 gamma_A m_A c².

But from earlier, E_com = m_p c^2 sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )).

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c^2 sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )).

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )).

Square both sides:

16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 = m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma )

gamma_A^2 = ( m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma ) ) / (16 m_A^2 )

gamma_A = sqrt( ( m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma ) ) ) / (4 m_A )

But gamma_A is also the Lorentz factor for the A particles' speed u in the COM frame, which is the same as their speed in any frame because speed is frame-dependent. Wait, no, because in the COM frame, each A has speed u, but in the lab frame, their speed would be different. Hmm, perhaps this is complicating things.

Wait, but in the COM frame, the A particles are moving with speed u, and their total momentum is zero. So, each must have momentum vectors that cancel out. For four particles, perhaps two move in +x and two in -x, each with speed u. Then, the total momentum would be zero.

But the energy in the COM frame is 4 gamma_A m_A c², which equals the COM energy as derived earlier.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )).

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A m_A = m_p sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )).

Square both sides:

16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 = m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma )

gamma_A^2 = [ m_p^2 * 2 (1 + gamma ) ] / (16 m_A^2 )

gamma_A = [ m_p sqrt(2 (1 + gamma )) ] / (4 m_A )

But gamma_A is also 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

Wait, but I'm not sure how this helps me find u. Maybe I can relate this to the lab frame.

But perhaps it's easier to go back to the lab frame and use conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, let's try to write the equations again.

In the lab frame:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v.

Final energy: E_final =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Final momentum: p_final =4 gamma_A m_A u (assuming all move in same direction, which may not be correct but let's proceed for now).

So,

E_initial = E_final → m_p (1 + gamma ) =4 m_A gamma_A.

p_initial = p_final → gamma m_p v =4 gamma_A m_A u.

Let me try to eliminate variables.

From the first equation: m_p (1 + gamma ) =4 m_A gamma_A → gamma_A = m_p (1 + gamma )/(4 m_A )

From the second equation: gamma m_p v =4 m_A gamma_A u.

Substitute gamma_A:

gamma m_p v =4 m_A * [ m_p (1 + gamma )/(4 m_A ) ] * u.

Simplify:

gamma m_p v = m_p (1 + gamma ) u.

Cancel m_p:

gamma v = (1 + gamma ) u → u = (gamma v )/(1 + gamma )

But gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

u = [ v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ] / (1 + 1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) )

This is getting complicated, but let's set c=1 for simplicity.

So,

u = v / sqrt(1 - v²) * [ 1/(1 + 1/sqrt(1 -v²) ) ]

= [ v ] / [ sqrt(1 -v²) (1 + 1/sqrt(1 -v²) ) ]

= [ v ] / [ sqrt(1 -v²) + 1 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can let x = sqrt(1 -v^2), which implies that v = sqrt(1 -x² ), and 1 -v^2 =x².

Then,

u = [ sqrt(1 -x^2) ] / (x + 1 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express u in terms of gamma and then substitute into gamma_A.

Wait, from u = (gamma v )/(1 + gamma )

And v = sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2 )

So,

u = (gamma * sqrt(1 -1/gamma^2) ) / (1 + gamma )

= sqrt( gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2) ) / (1 + gamma )

= sqrt( gamma^2 -1 ) / (1 + gamma )

= sqrt( (gamma -1)(gamma +1) ) / (gamma +1 )

= sqrt( (gamma -1) ) * sqrt( (gamma +1) ) / (gamma +1 )

= sqrt( (gamma -1) ) / sqrt( gamma +1 )

Hmm.

But this seems a bit stuck. Maybe I can substitute the expression for gamma in terms of m_A and m_p.

Wait, recalling that gamma_A = m_p (1 + gamma )/(4 m_A )

But gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - u² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 -u^2) = [ m_p (1 + gamma ) ]/(4 m_A )

But from earlier, gamma is a function of m_A and m_p.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute gamma in terms of m_A and m_p.

Wait, from the first equation:

gamma = [ (8 m_A^2 )/( m_p^2 ) ] -1.

Wait, earlier I think I had gamma = (8 m_A² )/( m_p^2 ) -1, but that led to a negative gamma, which isn't possible. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the initial approximation that the antiproton's velocity is very small, so gamma ≈1.

Wait, let me try that.

So, if gamma ≈1, then from equation 1:

m_p (1 +1 )=4 m_A gamma_A → 2 m_p =4 m_A gamma_A → gamma_A = m_p/(2 m_A )

Which is the same as before.

So, with m_p=938 MeV, m_A=300 MeV,

gamma_A =938/(2*300)=938/600≈1.563.

Which gives u≈0.77c, as before.

But earlier when I tried the exact approach, I ended up with gamma being negative, which suggests that the initial assumption (all four A particles moving in the same direction) is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use the approximation that the antiproton's velocity is small, leading to gamma ≈1, and hence u≈0.77c.

But looking back at the options, option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but why doesn't the exact calculation give a valid gamma? Maybe because the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. So perhaps in reality, the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel, leading to a different result.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approximation, which gives u≈0.77c, and choose option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The given data includes \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \), and the antiproton is moving slowly, allowing us to approximate its velocity \( v \) as much smaller than \( c \). The proton mass is \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Equations and Assumptions:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   The initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma \approx 1 \), so:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2
   \]
   The final energy is the total energy of the four \( A \)-particles:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles' velocity \( u \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The initial momentum is due to the antiproton:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p v
   \]
   Assuming the \( A \)-particles move symmetrically, their total momentum equals the initial momentum:
   \[
   p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A u
   \]

### Solving for \( u \):
From energy conservation:
\[
2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \implies \gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
\]
Substituting \( m_p = 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563
\]

Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \):
\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1.563} \approx 0.64
\]
\[
1 - u^2/c^2 = 0.4096 \implies u^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
\]
\[
u = \sqrt{0.5904} c \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option **A**.
