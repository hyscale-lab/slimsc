Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators that could modify the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. The idea is that you expand the theory in terms of higher-dimensional operators, each with a coefficient that you can determine experimentally.

So, the key point is figuring out which symmetries are automatically respected by SMEFT operators. I think that SMEFT is built by starting with the Standard Model and adding higher-order terms, so it must preserve the same symmetries as the Standard Model. But wait, does it?

Let me think about each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry. So any effective operator must also respect it because they're part of the same framework. I believe that all SMEFT operators are required to be Lorentz invariant. So yes, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, the SMEFT is constructed in a way that operators are classified in terms of their dimension, which implies they have a certain scaling under Poincare transformations like scaling (kinetic scaling). Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So if the operators are Lorentz scalars and the theory is renormalizable (well, SMEFT is non-renormalizable but still a field theory), then Poincare symmetry is maintained. Hmm. Wait, but is Poincare symmetry a separate symmetry here? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since all operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields, which transform under Poincare, then the operators would also respect it. So I think that operators in SMEFT respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

3. CP Symmetry: The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, or rather, the SM is not CP-symmetric because of the CKM problem, but individual terms or operators might violate CP. However, in SMEFT, when you write down operators, you can choose to impose certain symmetries. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. I think that the SMEFT operators need not necessarily preserve CP symmetry. Because the SM doesn't, and the effective theory allows for operators that can break CP further. So for example, operators like (ψ̄ γ^μ γ^5 ψ)^2 would violate CP, but such operators could exist if they're allowed by the symmetry constraints. So the SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 (CP) is not a must.

4. CPT Symmetry: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric. Because any Lorentz-invariant theory is CPT-symmetric, as per the CPT theorem. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, which it does, then it must respect CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So putting this together. The symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a minute. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But in an effective field theory, the operators are written in a way that includes all possible terms that are Poincare invariant. So if the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, and is a Lorentz-invariant field theory, then it automatically respects Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 must be respected. But wait, the question is which symmetries must all operators respect. Are both Lorentz and Poincare required, or is Poincare a given if Lorentz is in place?

Wait, in SMEFT, the operators are written as Lorentz scalars. So each operator is a Lorentz-invariant combination of fields. But since the theory is a field theory, it's built with local Lorentz symmetry (gauge symmetry? No, the SM has gauge symmetry, but Lorentz is a spacetime symmetry). So in any case, the point is that all operators are Lorentz-invariant. So Poincare symmetry includes translation invariance, which is also required because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, operators can include terms with different scaling under Poincare, but they are all Poincare-invariant. So yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare is a separate symmetry that SMEFT must respect. Because Poincare includes translation, which is a spacetime symmetry. Since the theory is formulated in a way that respects all spacetime symmetries, I think that the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Options:
A) 1,2 → C) 1,2,4 → So option C includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but option C is 1,2,4. So the three symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected, which is correct because the SM operators don't have to respect CP.

So the correct answer should include 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are required to be Lorentz-invariant because the Standard Model, from which SMEFT is derived, respects Lorentz symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT must transform as a Lorentz scalar.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects translation invariance, and all operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry is also automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry, and SMEFT inherits this property. Operators in SMEFT are not required to preserve CP symmetry, as CP violation is already present in the Standard Model. Thus, CP symmetry is not a necessary symmetry for all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, respects CPT symmetry, which is guaranteed by the CPT theorem for Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Wait, but in the SMEFT, operators can include terms with different scaling under Poincare, but they are all Poincare-invariant. So yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetry.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare is a separate symmetry that SMEFT must respect. Because Poincare includes translation, which is a spacetime symmetry. Since the theory is formulated in a way that respects all spacetime symmetries, I think that the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4. So looking at the options:

Options:
A) 1,2 → C) 1,2,4 → So option C includes Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but option C is 1,2,4. So the three symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 (CP) is not necessarily respected, which is correct because the SM operators don't have to respect CP.

So the correct answer should include 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are required to be Lorentz-invariant because the Standard Model, from which SMEFT is derived, respects Lorentz symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT must transform as a Lorentz scalar.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it inherently respects translation invariance, and all operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant combinations of fields. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry is also automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry, and SMEFT inherits this property. Operators in SMEFT are not required to preserve CP symmetry, as CP violation is already present in the Standard Model. Thus, CP symmetry is not a necessary symmetry for all SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and by extension SMEFT, respects CPT symmetry, which is guaranteed by the CPT theorem for Lorentz-invariant theories. Since SMEFT operators are Lorentz-invariant, they must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:
