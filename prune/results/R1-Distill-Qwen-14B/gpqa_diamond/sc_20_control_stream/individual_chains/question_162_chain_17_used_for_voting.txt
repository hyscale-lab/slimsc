Okay, so I have this question about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, and the metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere, right? I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. In some contexts, it's also called an anti-sphere. Oh wait, in the context of metric spaces, maybe this is related to hyperbolic geometry.

The given metric looks like it's in 2D, so it might be describing the surface of a pseudosphere. Let's analyze the metric. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which suggests a radial distance from the origin. So when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric blow up. That probably means that the maximum radius is 2, so r=2 is the edge of the pseudosphere.

Wait, but what's the area of a pseudosphere? I think the area (or surface area) of a pseudosphere with radius r is... wait, for a regular sphere in Euclidean space, the area is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is different. Oh right! I remember that the area of a pseudosphere is actually infinite. Because as you go towards the "equator," the circumference increases, and even though the radius is constant, the area keeps accumulating. So the total area becomes unbounded.

Alternatively, let's think about the metric given. The line element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, 4 is 2², so 4 - (x² + y²) is 4 - r², where r² = x² + y². So this metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model has a metric that becomes singular at the edge of the disk, which is at radius 2 in this case. 

In the Poincaré disk model, the area element is dA = [2/(R² - r²)]² dr dθ, where R is the radius of the disk. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, for the metric given, the area element would be the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. The metric tensor has off-diagonal terms zero, so the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the area element is (32/(4 - r²))² / ( (something) )? Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, the metric is diagonal, so det g = (32/(4 - r²))^2. So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)] times dx dy, because sqrt( (32/(4-r²))² ) = 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, no, actually, for a 2D metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² (if off-diagonal terms are zero), the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) dx dy. So here, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²), where r² is x² + y². So the area element dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y of dA. That is, the integral over r from 0 to 2 (since 4 - r² must be positive; beyond r=2, it's negative, which would cause problems in the metric, so that's the boundary) and θ from 0 to 2π. So in polar coordinates:

Area = ∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

Let me compute that. First, integrating over θ:

∫0^2π dθ = 2π.

So Area = 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr.

Hmm, let's compute the integral I = ∫ [32 r ] / (4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, 32 is a constant. Let me factor that out. I = 32 ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ [1/u] * (-1/2) du, with limits from u=4 to u=0.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which simplifies to 32 * (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

But wait, ln u approaches -infinity as u approaches zero. Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, so I = 32 * (-1/2) [ ln u evaluated from u=4 to u=0 ]

So that's I = 32 * (-1/2) [ (ln 0) - (ln 4) ) ]

But ln 0 is negative infinity, so (ln 0) - ln4 is -infinity minus a finite number, which is -infinity.

Multiply by (-1/2), so I becomes 32 * (-1/2) * (-infinity) ) = 32 * (1/2) * infinity = 16 * infinity = infinity.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +∞.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, characteristic of a pseudosphere. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) becomes singular at \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\), corresponding to a radius \(r = 2\). This singularity indicates the boundary of the pseudosphere.

To compute the area, the area element in polar coordinates is derived as 

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then computed by integrating over the region \(0 \leq r \leq 2\) and \(0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi\):

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrating over \(\theta\) gives:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The remaining radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = 32 \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \int_{4}^{0} \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
32 \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_{4}^{0} = 32 \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \left(\ln 0 - \ln 4\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 = -\infty\), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
