Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, i is the square root of -1, so that's the imaginary unit. Oh, right, because wave functions can be complex.

But when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because if the wave function is zero outside, that means the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that looks like a complex number. The general form of a wave function is usually real or complex, but the square of the absolute value gives the probability density. So the probability density is |ψ|^2.

But wait, the wave function given seems to be more than just a function. Let me think. The wave function is ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

But for the wave function to be normalizable, it should satisfy the condition that the integral of |ψ|^2 from -infinity to infinity is 1. But in our case, the wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3, right? Because outside that, it's zero. Wait, no. Wait, the given wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Because the problem states that when they measure, none are found outside 1 and 3, so the wave function must be zero there. But wait, the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That suggests it's a function that's non-zero in some regions. So perhaps I've misread the problem.

Wait, the wave function given is only valid in a part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, that part of the question says that the wave function is as given in a part of space where it can exist. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. So, the region where it's non-zero is where x is such that the wave function is defined. Wait, but the function is (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. The sqrt(1 + x) is real only if 1+x >=0, so x >= -1. But our measurements are from x=1 to x=3. So the wave function is non-zero between x=1 and x=3, perhaps? Or maybe between x=-1 and x=3? But the problem says the particles are found between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that would be non-zero for x >= -1. So how does this reconcile with the fact that the particle is only found between 1 and 3? Maybe the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, but the given function is in the region where it exists. So perhaps the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. Or perhaps the problem is that the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, which is a complex function. The modulus squared, |ψ|^2, would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the modulus squared is a^2 + b^2.

So, the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. But wait, the wave function must satisfy normalization. The integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1.

So, integrating (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

Let me write that equation:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Hmm, let's split the integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

So, first integral becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So approximately 0.85 is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is |a/(sqrt(1+x))|² + | -0.5i |². Which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes. So that seems correct.

The integral is from 1 to 3. So the first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Right.

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2)=2 ln2, and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2.

So that part is correct.

So then a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Which as I calculated is approximately 0.7213, so a is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85, option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Do I have the correct wave function? The question says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is that value, and zero elsewhere?

But wait, what about the region where x < -1? Because sqrt(1 +x) would become imaginary. So perhaps the wave function is zero for x < -1, and also for x >3, etc. But the given wave function applies only where it can exist. So I think the setup is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3, but the given expression is within that region. So the integral I computed is correct because only x=1 to 3 contribute.

Another thing to check: Is the wave function normalized? Because if the integral of |ψ|^2 is 1, then yes.

So, I think my calculation is correct, leading to a = approx 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), as particles are found exclusively in this region. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1 + x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1 + x} dx\)  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x} \) is \( \ln|1 + x| \). Thus:

   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1 + x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\)  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Hmm, let's split the integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each integral.

First integral: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

So, first integral becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So adding them together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213. Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, the options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So approximately 0.85 is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the setup?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is |a/(sqrt(1+x))|² + | -0.5i |². Which is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes. So that seems correct.

The integral is from 1 to 3. So the first integral is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Right.

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2)=2 ln2, and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2.

So that part is correct.

So then a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Which as I calculated is approximately 0.7213, so a is about 0.849, which rounds to 0.85, option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Do I have the correct wave function? The question says the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is that value, and zero elsewhere?

The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function:

   This is straightforward:

Solving for \( a^2 \):
