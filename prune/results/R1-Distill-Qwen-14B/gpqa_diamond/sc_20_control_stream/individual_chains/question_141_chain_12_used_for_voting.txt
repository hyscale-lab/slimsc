Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm, wait, wait. I think I misread that. Oh, no, it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2? Or maybe it's benzene with substituents on positions 1 and 2. Wait, maybe the structure is bromine at position 1 and something else at 2, but the 'd' is a typo or maybe a different substituent? Or maybe it's a typo and it's benzene with a bromine and a deutero group.

Wait, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So benzene with bromine on carbon 1, and perhaps a deuterium on carbon 2. Or could it be a different substituent? No, probably the 'd' refers to deuterium. So the structure has a Br on position 1 and a D on position 2. So it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene?

But maybe what's important is the positions of the substituents. So the starting material is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. Wait, but why would that matter? Maybe it's about the mechanism of the reaction.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. That's a strong base, right? I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic substitution, especially when dealing with directing groups, it can act as a base to deprotonate certain positions to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, leading to possible aromatic alkylation or arylation.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the bromine is in the para position relative to where? Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering is important. Wait, 1 and 2 positions are adjacent, so the bromine is at position 1 and the deutero is at position 2. So the structure is bromine at C1 and deuterium at C2.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the relative positions matter for the possible products. So when NaNH2 is added, what happens?

In such reactions, NaNH2 is often used to deprotonate the ring at positions that are activated, typically ortho and para to meta-directing groups. Wait, bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, which is a meta director. So when the ring has a bromine, the deprotonation would occur at the meta positions relative to the Br? Or wait, wait, perhaps I should think about this more carefully.

Wait, the reaction of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia. Let me think about the possible reactions. I remember that when a halobenzene is treated with a strong base, especially in a polar aprotic solvent like ammonia, it can undergo a substitution reaction, possibly a benzyne mechanism.

Wait, but more specifically, for bromobenzene, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 can deprotonate the ring. The positions where deprotonation occurs are typically those activated towards such a process. For bromobenzene, the deprotonation occurs at the ortho and para positions relative to the bromine, but wait, bromine is a meta director in electrophilic substitution. Wait, but deprotonation is a base-catalyzed process, so the positions that are most acidic would be the ones that can stabilize the negative charge after deprotonation.

In aromatic systems, the acidity of protons is influenced by the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups increase the acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base. So in bromobenzene, the protons ortho and para to the Br are more acidic because the negative charge can be delocalized into the ring via resonance, and the electronegative Br can stabilize the charge through inductive effects.

So, when NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts a proton from either the ortho or para positions relative to the Br. Let's imagine the starting material is bromobenzene (without deuterium), so the possible positions for deprotonation would be ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4). But wait, in our case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so the position 2 has a D instead of a proton.

Wait, so position 2 is deuterated. So, if the initial ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2, then the available protons for deprotonation would be at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 (since 1 is Br, 2 is D, 3 is H, 4 is H, 5 is H, 6 is H).

But wait, when the base is added, it would abstract a proton that's activated. Since Br is at position 1, the ortho positions are 2 and 6, para is 4. But position 2 has D, not H, so the ortho position is already substituted. So the available positions for deprotonation would be 6 (ortho to Br) if it's H, but in the starting molecule, position 2 is D, so position 6 is H. Also, para is position 4.

Wait, so in the starting molecule, the ring has Br at position 1, D at 2, and positions 3,4,5,6 have H. So the ortho positions to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so cannot be deprotonated. Position 6 is H, so that's a possible site.

The para position is 4. So, positions 4 and 6 are the possible sites for deprotonation.

Wait, but wait, when a base abstracts a proton, it's usually from the most acidic position. In bromobenzene, the para position is more acidic than the ortho because the conjugate base can better stabilize the charge when the negative charge is para to the Br. Because in the para position, the negative charge is opposite to the Br, so the inductive effect of Br (electron-withdrawing) can stabilize the negative charge better. So the para position (position 4) is more acidic than the ortho (position 6).

So, the base would deprotonate the para position (position 4) first. But wait, sometimes the ortho can also be deprotonated, but perhaps in this case, the para is more favorable.

Once the proton is abstracted, a benzene ring with a negative charge at that position (say, position 4) would form. Then, the reaction could proceed via the benzyne mechanism or perhaps undergo some alkylation or arylation.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, and in ammonia solvent, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, maybe the bromide leaves, forming a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then could undergo some elimination to form a triple bond (benzyne), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: when a halobenzene is treated with a strong base, the base abstracts a proton ortho or para to the halide, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge. This can lead to the elimination of the halide as a leaving group, forming a triple bond between the adjacent carbons, resulting in a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but wait, in the case of bromobenzene, the base deprotonates at position 4 (para to Br), forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 4. The Br leaves as Br⁻, and this leads to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 4, making benzyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the deprotonation occurs ortho to Br, but in our case, position 2 is D, so that's not possible. So the deprotonation would occur at position 6 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (Br) and position 2 (D), so perhaps the acidity at position 6 is higher. Hmm.

Wait, but regardless, the formation of the benzyne would require the elimination of Br and a proton, leading to the triple bond. But wait, maybe in this reaction, the deuterium is involved.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So position 2 is deuterated. Let me think about the possible sites for deprotonation. The para position is position 4, and the ortho is position 6. So, when the base abstracts a proton, it's either at position 4 or 6.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 4, then the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 4, right? Because in that scenario, the adjacent positions are 1 (Br) and 4 (negative charge after deprotonation). So eliminating Br⁻ would form a triple bond between 1 and 4.

But wait, the positions are: 1-Br, 2-D, 3-H, 4-H, 5-H, 6-H. So after deprotonation at 4, we have negative charge at 4. Then, if Br leaves, a triple bond would form between 1 and 4. But wait, the triple bond would involve positions 1 and 4. Let me visualize the benzene ring: position 1 is Br, position 4 is one carbon away from it, but wait, in benzene, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other (para). So the triple bond would form between 1 and 4, which are para positions. That would create a triple bond, making benzyne (a six-membered ring with a triple bond, making it antiaromatic, so it's very unstable and tends to undergo addition reactions).

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br at position 1. So position 6 is adjacent to position 1. Deprotonation at 6 would lead to a negative charge at 6, which is ortho to Br. Then, the Br would leave, and a triple bond would form between 1 and 6. But wait, position 1 and 6 are adjacent (ortho), so the triple bond would be between two adjacent carbons, which isn't possible in a benzene ring because that would make the ring too strained. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others, so triple bonds can't form between adjacent carbons because that would require three bonds, which would create a triple bond in a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let me number the benzene ring correctly. Let's imagine the benzene ring with position 1 at the top (like 12 o'clock). Then, position 2 is at around 1 o'clock, position 3 at 2 o'clock, and so on, going clockwise. So position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, and position 6 is next to position 1 (on the other side of the ring). So if the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to Br, which is at position 1), then the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 4, which are across from each other. But wait, that would require a triple bond between two carbons that are opposite each other, which is possible. So that would form a triple bond between 1 and 4, making a benzyne structure.

Alternatively, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br), then the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent. But that's not possible because that would form a triple bond between two adjacent ring carbons, which would create a very strained structure. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others, so a triple bond between adjacent carbons would not form a strain because the ring would remain intact. Wait, no, that's not the case. A triple bond in a six-membered ring would cause the ring to be non-planar, but in any case, perhaps the benzyne forms between 1 and 4.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: when you deprotonate at position 4, which is para to Br, then the Br leaves, and the adjacent carbons (positions 3 and 4) would form a triple bond with the position 1. No, wait, position 1 is Br, so when it leaves, the adjacent carbons would be positions 2 and 6, but I'm not sure. Maybe the benzyne forms between positions 1 and 4, but that would mean a triple bond across the ring, making a 1,4-didehydrobenzene structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible products. The reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne. But the question is about the possible organic products, so perhaps after the benzyne is formed, it can undergo some reactions, like trapping with another molecule or addition of something. But in the presence of NaNH2 and ammonia, perhaps the reaction stops at the benzyne stage, but more likely, benzyne might react with something else, but maybe in this setup, it just forms the benzyne and that's the product.

Wait, but benzyne is an intermediate, so perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed to form something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead forms a substituted benzene via elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond. But how does that affect the possible products?

Wait, in any case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with NaNH2, the base abstracts a proton ortho or para to the Br. But in this case, the ortho position (position 2) is deuterated, so the base can only abstract protons from position 6 (ortho) and position 4 (para).

So, deprotonation could occur at position 6 and 4. Let's say it occurs at position 4. Then, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 4. But wait, I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, the deprotonation could occur at position 6, leading to a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's adjacent, so maybe it's not possible.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible elimination products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then eliminates Br⁻ to form a triple bond.

So, the possible sites for deprotonation are positions 4 (para) and 6 (ortho). So, if deprotonation occurs at position 4, elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 4. If it occurs at position 6, elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others, so a triple bond between 1 and 4 would require that the ring structure remains, but that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps when the base abstracts a proton at position 6, the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent. But that would make the ring have three bonds between two adjacent carbons, which is impossible. So maybe the reaction can't form a triple bond in that position, so the only possible site is position 4.

Wait, but that would mean only one possible product, which is the benzyne structure. But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and if deprotonation occurs at position 4, then the product would be 1,4-benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a six-membered ring with a triple bond between two opposite carbons (like 1 and 4), which is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the deprotonation can occur at either position 4 or 6, but position 6 might not be feasible due to the ring structure. So perhaps only one product is possible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about this again. The starting structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, positions: 1-Br, 2-D, 3-H, 4-H, 5-H, 6-H.

When the base (NaNH2) is added, it abstracts protons from positions that are more acidic. The para position (4) is more acidic than the ortho (6) because the negative charge after deprotonation can be better stabilized by the Br's inductive effect when it's para.

So, the base would abstract the proton from position 4, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at 4. The Br then leaves as Br⁻, and the adjacent carbons (positions 1 and 4) form a triple bond, making benzyne.

But wait, in this case, the benzyne would have a triple bond between 1 and 4, which is para positions. So the structure would be 1,4-didehydrobenzene, which is the benzyne.

But what about position 6? The base could abstract the proton there, but will that lead to a different product? If the base abstracts position 6, then elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, which are adjacent. But in a benzene ring, that's not feasible, so perhaps the only possible elimination is at position 4, leading to a single product.

Wait, but wait another thought. The deprotonation could lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, and perhaps the Br leaves without forming a triple bond. Or maybe the ring could undergo some other reaction, like a substitution. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead leads to the formation of another bromobenzene derivative. Wait, but that might not make sense.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But in the case of the starting material, only one possible triple bond can form, leading to one product.

Wait, but wait, what if the deprotonation occurs at position 6? Let's say the base abstracts the proton at position 6, leading to a negative charge there. Then, the Br leaves, and a triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6. But that's impossible in benzene because positions 1 and 6 are adjacent, and a triple bond would require three bonds, which isn't possible in a ring structure. So perhaps deprotonation at 6 isn't feasible, leaving only position 4 as the possible site.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction occurs at both positions, leading to different products. But if only position 4 is possible, then there's only one product.

Wait, but wait another point. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, position 2 has a deuterium. Does that affect the acidity of the protons at positions 4 and 6? I don't think so, because deuterium is more acidic than hydrogen, but in this case, position 2 is already deuterated, so the adjacent positions (like 1 and 3) might have different acidity, but I don't think that's the case.

So, perhaps the only possible product is the benzyne formed by elimination at position 4.

But wait, another thought: maybe the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead undergoes some coupling. Or perhaps, the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which then could attack another molecule or something else. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good source of NH2- ions. So perhaps the benzene ring with negative charge could undergo alkylation, but without an alkyl halide present, I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but in the given reaction, we only have NaNH2 and ammonia. So the solvent is the ammonia, which is a base and a source of NH2-.

Wait, another possibility: the deprotonated benzene could then react with another molecule of the starting material, leading to some dimerization. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, forming benzyne, which is a reactive intermediate. But the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if benzyne is formed, that's the product. But wait, benzyne is a diradical, or a triple bond, but in terms of counting products, perhaps it's considered as one product.

Wait, but another possibility: when the base abstracts a proton from position 4, the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between 1 and 4, making benzyne. But benzyne is a diradical, so it's in a high-energy state and could potentially dimerize or react further. But without any other reagent, perhaps it just forms the benzyne as the product.

So, in this case, the product is benzyne, which is a single product. So the number of possible products is 1.

Wait, but wait another angle. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, when the base deprotonates, it could abstract either the H at position 6 or position 4. So, if both positions are possible, would that lead to two different products?

Wait, but if the deprotonation occurs at position 4, the triple bond is between 1 and 4. If deprotonation occurs at position 6, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, but that's adjacent, which is impossible. So perhaps only position 4 is possible, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract from either position 4 or 6, but in each case, the benzyne would form between 1 and 4 or 1 and 6, but 1 and 6 are adjacent, so that's not possible. So perhaps only elimination at 4 is possible, leading to one product.

Wait, but then why would the deprotonation at 6 not be possible? Because position 6 is ortho to Br, which is more acidic than para? Or is the para position more acidic?

I think the para position is more acidic because the negative charge is better stabilized when it's para to the Br. So the base would preferentially abstract a proton from the para position (position 4) rather than the ortho (position 6).

Therefore, the reaction would form a single product, which is the benzyne structure from elimination at the para position. So the number of possible products is 1.

But wait, the options don't have 1 as the answer for option B, wait looking back: the options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

So, according to this line of reasoning, the answer would be B)1.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the deuterium at position 2 affects the acidity of the neighboring protons. For example, the presence of a deuterium adjacent to the proton at position 6 might influence the acidity of the proton at position 6. Because D is more electronegative than H, so perhaps the acidity at position 6 is higher. Hmm, but wait, deuterium is actually less acidic than hydrogen because the bond strength is higher. Wait, no, in the context of aromatic protons, the acidity is more about resonance and inductive effects than just the bond strength.

Wait, in any case, the presence of deuterium at position 2 may or may not affect the acidity of the protons at positions 4 and 6. But I think it's negligible, so the para position is still more acidic.

So, conclusion: only one product is formed, so the answer is B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH₂ is a strong base that abstracts protons from positions ortho and para to the electron-withdrawing bromine group, as these positions are more acidic due to resonance and inductive effects.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Effects**: Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, making the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) protons more acidic. However, position 2 is already deuterated, so it cannot be deprotonated. This leaves positions 4 (para) and 6 (ortho) as potential sites for deprotonation.

2. **Deprotonation and Elimination**:
   - Deprotonation at position 4 (para to bromine) leads to the formation of a negatively charged intermediate at position 4. The bromine then leaves as Br⁻, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 4, resulting in benzyne (1,4-didehydrobenzene).
   - Deprotonation at position 6 (ortho to bromine) is less favorable because the resulting triple bond between positions 1 and 6 would be highly strained and unlikely in a benzene ring. Thus, this pathway is not feasible.

3. **Product Formation**: The reaction proceeds via deprotonation at position 4, leading to the formation of benzyne as the sole product. Since deprotonation at position 6 does not yield a stable product, only one product is possible.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces a single product, benzyne, as the result of deprotonation at the para position (position 4) and subsequent elimination of bromine. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
