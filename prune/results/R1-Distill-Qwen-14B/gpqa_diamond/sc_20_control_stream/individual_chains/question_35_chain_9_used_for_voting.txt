Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, so S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), right? So the operator Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is asking which statement among the options A to D is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm. Let's go through each option and see which makes sense.

First, I think I should compute the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down Ay first. Ay = c * S, so substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix elements are:
- (0) * c at (1,1)
- (-i c) at (1,2)
- (i c) at (2,1)
- (0) at (2,2)

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I set up the equation (Ay - a I) where I is the identity matrix. So each diagonal element is (0 - a) and (0 - a).

The determinant of (Ay - a I) is:

| (-a)       (-i c)        |
| (i c)     (-a)        | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i^2 c²) = a² - (-1)(c²) = a² + c².

Set this equal to zero: a² + c² = 0. So a² = -c². Wait, but a is a real number, right? Or can it be complex? Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues, I think. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait, no, in this case, since S is part of the angular momentum operator, which has eigenvalues that are multiples of ħ/2 or something. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the equation is a² + c² = 0. So a² = -c². That would mean a is imaginary. But that can't be right because eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real. Is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The matrix S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Wait, the conjugate transpose of S would have the first row as [0, i], second row as [-i, 0]. Which is not the same as S. So S is skew-Hermitian, perhaps. Because S† = -S. Let me see:

S† is [0, i; -i, 0], which is -S, right? Because S is [0, -i; i, 0]. So S† = -S. So S is skew-Hermitian. Now, if c is a real scalar, then Ay = c * S is also skew-Hermitian, since (c S)† = c^* S† = c (-S) = -c S. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. So then, the eigenvalues of an anti-Hermitian matrix are purely imaginary. So a is imaginary.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So the eigenvalues a must be imaginary. Let's go back to the characteristic equation.

We have a² + c² = 0, so a^2 = - c^2. So a = ±i c.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = i c and a = -i c. Let's compute c first. c is h/(4π). So a is i (h/(4π)) and -i (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with magnitude h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π), and the real parts are zero. Wait, but none of the options mention that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit, because our calculation shows imaginary parts are ±h/(4π), and real parts are zero.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense either. Where would those numbers come from? Maybe if the matrix S was scaled differently.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. So the elements are 0, -i h/(4π), i h/(4π), 0.

The matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues are found by solving (Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant is ( -a )( -a ) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c^2 ) = a² - ( (-i^2) c² ) = a² - ( ( -(-1) ) c² ) because i^2 is -1. So that's a² - (1 * c² )= a² - c² = 0.

Wait wait wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me recompute the determinant.

The off-diagonal terms are (-i c) and (i c). So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Since (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is c². So the determinant is (a^2 - c^2) = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c. Oh, wait! That changes everything.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. So c is h/(4π), so a = h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, not imaginary. That makes sense because if Ay is Hermitian, which I think it should be, but wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait earlier I thought S is skew-Hermitian. Let me double-check.

S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is -S. So S is skew-Hermitian. Then, Ay = c S. So if c is a real number, Ay is anti-Hermitian because (c S)† = c^* S† = c (-S) = -c S = -(c S) = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but then the eigenvalues should be imaginary. But according to the determinant, a² = c², so a = ±c, which is real. That's a contradiction. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix being anti-Hermitian. Let me think again. Let me compute Ay^dagger.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * S.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which equals [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is equal to -S. So S^† = -S.

So Ay^† = (h/(4π)) * S^† = (h/(4π)) * (-S) = - (h/(4π)) S = - Ay.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian. So for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So how come when I computed the determinant, I found real eigenvalues?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me recompute the determinant step.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a,    -i c ]
[ i c,  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

Let me compute (-i c)(i c): (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1)=1. So (-i c)(i c )= (1) c².

So determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

But if Ay is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues should be imaginary. So this suggests that I'm getting real eigenvalues, which contradicts the property of an anti-Hermitian operator.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Wait, perhaps S isn't part of the spin-1/2 system. Because in spin-1/2 systems, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Wait, but that might be another approach.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are Hermitian. Each has eigenvalues ±1. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix.

Wait, but in this problem, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which looks similar to the Pauli matrix σy.

Wait, wait, the Pauli matrix σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is equal to σy. Oh wait, because σy is exactly that.

So S = σy. And the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So that would imply that in our case, Ay = c S = (ħ/(4π)) σy.

Wait, but the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So in our case, c is h/(4π), which is equal to (ħ/(2π)) because h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). Let me compute c.

c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) σy = Sy. Oh wait, that makes sense because S is σy, and c is ħ/2.

Wait! So if S is σy, then Ay is Sy, the y-component of spin operator. So the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, which would make sense, because the spin operator is Hermitian.

Wait a second, but according to this, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. But earlier, when I computed the determinant, I found a² = c², so a = ±c, which would be ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but if c = ħ/2, since h = 2π ħ, so h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So a = ±c = ± (ħ/2). Which are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

Wait, so earlier I thought Ay was anti-Hermitian, but that can't be the case because spin operators are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of whether Ay is Hermitian. Let me see. Ay is c * S, where S is σy. And σy is Hermitian. So because c is a real number, Ay is Hermitian as well.

So Ay should have real eigenvalues, which align with the calculation of a = ±c = ± (h/(4π)) = ± ħ/(2).

So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but in the options, which one aligns with this?

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, that's not right.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would be if c is 1/2, but our c is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/2, assuming ħ = h/(2π). So when h is in terms of, say, units where ħ is 1, but not sure.

But looking at the options, none of the options directly mention this. Let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Well, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of Sx, Sy, Sz don't share eigenfunctions except for the cases where they commute. However, the square of the angular momentum operator, S², commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Sy is also an eigenfunction of S². So for the operator Ay (which is proportional to Sy), the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A² (since A is the same as S). But they wouldn't be eigenfunctions of Az (the z-component), because Sy and Sz don't commute. So statement C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions of the matrix operator—perhaps referring to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Well, any 2x2 Hermitian matrix has two orthogonal eigenvectors, so they form a basis. So statement D would be correct as well. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me reconsider.

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So for the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are 2πh or -2πh. That's not correct because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would be if c is 1/2, but our c is h/(4π). If h is taken as 2π (in natural units, perhaps), then h/(4π) = (2π)/(4π) )= 1/2. So in that case, the eigenvalues are ±1/2. So in the determinant equation, a² = (1/2)^2, so a= ±1/2. So this would match option B.

Wait, but h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626e-34 J s, but in the equation, c is h/(4π). So if in the problem statement, the matrix S is given as part of the operator, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±1/2. Let me think.

Wait, but the actual value of c is h/(4π), but the eigenvalues are ±c. So if c is h/(4π), and h is in terms of units where, say, h=2π, then c becomes (2π)/(4π)= 1/2. So the eigenvalues would be a=±1/2.

But without knowing the units, I can't be sure. Wait, but the problem states that the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix σy. So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) σy. But the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ± h/(4π). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π). So (h/(4π)) is equal to ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are real and equal to ± ħ/2. So now, looking at the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh. That can't be right, since the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, if ħ is 1, then eigenvalues are ±1/2. So if the problem uses units where ħ=1, then the eigenvalues are ±1/2, which would make option B correct. But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps this is a possible scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is given in terms of σy scaled by a factor. Let me re-express Ay.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±1/2 if the operator is (σy)/2. Because σy has eigenvalues ±1, so (σy)/2 has eigenvalues ±1/2.

Wait, wait the problem says Ay = c * S, and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is σy. So if c is 1/2, then Ay would be (σy)/2, which has eigenvalues ±1/2. So if c is 1/2, then option B is correct.

But in our problem, c is h/(4π). Let me compute c in terms of ħ.

Since ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ.

Then c = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy.

The eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2.

So the real parts are ± ħ/2, and the imaginary parts are zero. So none of the options A or B are correct because they all mention non-zero imaginary parts.

So looking back at the options, perhaps option C is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, because A² is the square of the spin, which commutes with Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0, since A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components.

But for Az, the z-component doesn't commute with Ay. Because [Ay, Az] = i ħ Ax (by angular momentum commutation relations), so they don't commute. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

I'm not exactly clear on what this means. The basis functions of the matrix operator would probably refer to the eigenvectors forming the basis for the space. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) span the space, so they form a basis. So statement D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think that makes sense because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors (if they are two distinct eigenvalues) form a basis. So the statement D is correct.

But then, which of the statements is correct. So the possible correct options are C and D.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps in the process, which statement would hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, another approach: Let's see what the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is S² (since A is the angular momentum), which is the same as (ħ/2)^2 σy^2 = (ħ^2/4) I, because σy² = I.

So A² has eigenvalues (ħ^2/4) for any state, since σy² is identity. So any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A². So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space, which is correct because a 2x2 matrix has two eigenvectors (assuming distinct eigenvalues), which are orthogonal, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, I can only choose one.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the matrix operator has the form Ay = c S, with c = h/(4π), and S as given. So the matrix is 2x2, so it's a spin-½ system. The eigenfunctions are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction. These are the basis vectors for the space. So D would be correct because any 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues has eigenvectors forming a basis.

But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvectors are the same as the basis functions of the matrix. But the basis functions of the matrix operator would be its eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem gives four options, and I have to choose which is correct.

So, reviewing:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π) = ± ħ/2. So they are real. So options A and B, which involve imaginary parts, are incorrect.

Option C: Correct, because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let's look again at the matrix S. S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is σy, so it's Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So in this case, the eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for the 2D space. So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

But wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are its basis. So D is correct.

But the problem is in the options, I have to choose which statement is correct. So options C and D seem correct. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem is about the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So A is the angular momentum operator. So A² would be (S)^2, which for a spin-½ particle is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 σ·σ, but no, wait, no, S² for spin-½ is (ħ/2)^2 * 3? No, wait, for a spin-½ particle, S² = ( (s(s+1) ) ) ħ², where s=½. So S² = ( (½)(½+1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But regardless, A² has the same eigenvalue for all states. So any eigenstate of Ay would be an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So which one is the correct statement?

The statement in option C is correct, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D is also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. The eigenfunctions of Ay are a basis because the operator is 2x2 and has two orthogonal eigenvectors. So option D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct because D is perhaps not exactly correct.

Wait, the statement in option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is 2x2, and the basis functions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2x2 space. So the statement is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct, so perhaps options C and D are both correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps another option is better.

Wait, looking back, the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π) which is ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, which makes options A and B incorrect. So the correct statements would be C and D.

But looking at the options given, perhaps only C is correct. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. That's correct.

So if both are correct, but the problem gives only one correct option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but the problem says 'which statement below will you consider to be correct?' So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, in the problem, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σy, which is Hermitian. So the operator Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

But in a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of Sy are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

So perhaps the correct options are C and D.

But since the options are exclusive, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the matrix operator's eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct.

Wait, but let's look at the problem again. The question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the given options don't have that, so perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the matrix operator's basis. The basis functions of the matrix operator might refer to the matrix's own basis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form an orthonormal basis, which is true.

So given the options, the correct statements are C and D. But since the problem expects only one correct option, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but looking again, the provided options are:

A) Incorrect because eigenvalues are real.

B) Incorrect.

C) Correct.

D) Correct.

But since the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, perhaps the intended correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But looking back, the problem statement gives only one correct option, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, as the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix form a basis for the space.

So both statements C and D are correct, but the problem gives these as separate options. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about what "basis functions of the matrix operator" means. The matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors are a basis for the vector space, so D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the problem expects only one option.

But I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me try to think what the question is asking. It's about which statement is correct during the calculation.

In the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues, I find they are real, so any option that talks about imaginary parts is out. So A and B are incorrect.

Between C and D, both seem correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But in that case, the correct answer would be D. But since I'm not sure, perhaps I should rely on the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 + \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
   \]
   Solving \( a^2 = -\left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \), the eigenvalues are:
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Hermiticity of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian (\( S^\dagger = S \)), and since \( c \) is real, \( A_y \) is also Hermitian. This ensures real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 Hermitian matrix with distinct eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis for the 2D space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is "correct during the calculation," and option C is more directly relevant to the properties of eigenfunctions and their relationship with other components of the angular momentum operator.

### Conclusion

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the fact that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, Ay. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, so S is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π), right? So the operator Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question is asking which statement among the options A to D is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Hmm. Let's go through each option and see which makes sense.

First, I think I should compute the eigenvalues of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me write down Ay first. Ay = c * S, so substituting c:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix elements are:
- (0) * c at (1,1)
- (-i c) at (1,2)
- (i c) at (2,1)
- (0) at (2,2)

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i c],
  [i c, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I set up the equation (Ay - a I) where I is the identity matrix. So each diagonal element is (0 - a) and (0 - a).

The determinant of (Ay - a I) is:

| (-a)       (-i c)        |
| (i c)     (-a)        | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i^2 c²) = a² - (-1)(c²) = a² + c².

Set this equal to zero: a² + c² = 0. So a² = -c². Wait, but a is a real number, right? Or can it be complex? Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues, I think. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait, no, in this case, since S is part of the angular momentum operator, which has eigenvalues that are multiples of ħ/2 or something. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the equation is a² + c² = 0. So a² = -c². That would mean a is imaginary. But that can't be right because eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real. Is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The matrix S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Wait, the conjugate transpose of S would have the first row as [0, i], second row as [-i, 0]. Which is not the same as S. So S is skew-Hermitian, perhaps. Because S† = -S. Let me see:

S† is [0, i; -i, 0], which is -S, right? Because S is [0, -i; i, 0]. So S† = -S. So S is skew-Hermitian. Now, if c is a real scalar, then Ay = c * S is also skew-Hermitian, since (c S)† = c^* S† = c (-S) = -c S. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. So then, the eigenvalues of an anti-Hermitian matrix are purely imaginary. So a is imaginary.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenvalues of Ay. So the eigenvalues a must be imaginary. Let's go back to the characteristic equation.

We have a² + c² = 0, so a^2 = - c^2. So a = ±i c.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are a = i c and a = -i c. Let's compute c first. c is h/(4π). So a is i (h/(4π)) and -i (h/(4π)).

So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, with magnitude h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are ± h/(4π), and the real parts are zero. Wait, but none of the options mention that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and the real parts are ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit, because our calculation shows imaginary parts are ±h/(4π), and real parts are zero.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense either. Where would those numbers come from? Maybe if the matrix S was scaled differently.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check again.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. So the elements are 0, -i h/(4π), i h/(4π), 0.

The matrix is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]], where c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues are found by solving (Ay - a I) = 0.

The determinant is ( -a )( -a ) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c^2 ) = a² - ( (-i^2) c² ) = a² - ( ( -(-1) ) c² ) because i^2 is -1. So that's a² - (1 * c² )= a² - c² = 0.

Wait wait wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me recompute the determinant.

The off-diagonal terms are (-i c) and (i c). So the product is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². Since (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is c². So the determinant is (a^2 - c^2) = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c. Oh, wait! That changes everything.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. So c is h/(4π), so a = h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, not imaginary. That makes sense because if Ay is Hermitian, which I think it should be, but wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait earlier I thought S is skew-Hermitian. Let me double-check.

S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is -S. So S is skew-Hermitian. Then, Ay = c S. So if c is a real number, Ay is anti-Hermitian because (c S)† = c^* S† = c (-S) = -c S = -(c S) = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but then the eigenvalues should be imaginary. But according to the determinant, a² = c², so a = ±c, which is real. That's a contradiction. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix being anti-Hermitian. Let me think again. Let me compute Ay^dagger.

Ay is (h/(4π)) * S.

S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which equals [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is equal to -S. So S^† = -S.

So Ay^† = (h/(4π)) * S^† = (h/(4π)) * (-S) = - (h/(4π)) S = - Ay.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian. So for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So how come when I computed the determinant, I found real eigenvalues?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let me recompute the determinant step.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a,    -i c ]
[ i c,  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ].

Let me compute (-i c)(i c): (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1)=1. So (-i c)(i c )= (1) c².

So determinant is a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

But if Ay is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues should be imaginary. So this suggests that I'm getting real eigenvalues, which contradicts the property of an anti-Hermitian operator.

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Wait, perhaps S isn't part of the spin-1/2 system. Because in spin-1/2 systems, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Wait, but that might be another approach.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz are Hermitian. Each has eigenvalues ±1. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix.

Wait, but in this problem, S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which looks similar to the Pauli matrix σy.

Wait, wait, the Pauli matrix σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is equal to σy. Oh wait, because σy is exactly that.

So S = σy. And the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So that would imply that in our case, Ay = c S = (ħ/(4π)) σy.

Wait, but the spin operator Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So in our case, c is h/(4π), which is equal to (ħ/(2π)) because h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). Let me compute c.

c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) σy = Sy. Oh wait, that makes sense because S is σy, and c is ħ/2.

Wait! So if S is σy, then Ay is Sy, the y-component of spin operator. So the eigenvalues of Sy are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, which would make sense, because the spin operator is Hermitian.

Wait a second, but according to this, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. But earlier, when I computed the determinant, I found a² = c², so a = ±c, which would be ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but if c = ħ/2, since h = 2π ħ, so h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2.

So a = ±c = ± (ħ/2). Which are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

Wait, so earlier I thought Ay was anti-Hermitian, but that can't be the case because spin operators are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of whether Ay is Hermitian. Let me see. Ay is c * S, where S is σy. And σy is Hermitian. So because c is a real number, Ay is Hermitian as well.

So Ay should have real eigenvalues, which align with the calculation of a = ±c = ± (h/(4π)) = ± ħ/(2).

So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but in the options, which one aligns with this?

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, that's not right.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would be if c is 1/2, but our c is h/(4π), which is the same as ħ/2, assuming ħ = h/(2π). So when h is in terms of, say, units where ħ is 1, but not sure.

But looking at the options, none of the options directly mention this. Let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Well, for spin systems, the eigenfunctions of Sx, Sy, Sz don't share eigenfunctions except for the cases where they commute. However, the square of the angular momentum operator, S², commutes with all components, so any eigenfunction of Sy is also an eigenfunction of S². So for the operator Ay (which is proportional to Sy), the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A² (since A is the same as S). But they wouldn't be eigenfunctions of Az (the z-component), because Sy and Sz don't commute. So statement C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what this means. Basis functions of the matrix operator—perhaps referring to the eigenvectors forming a basis. Well, any 2x2 Hermitian matrix has two orthogonal eigenvectors, so they form a basis. So statement D would be correct as well. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me reconsider.

The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So for the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are 2πh or -2πh. That's not correct because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, that would be if c is 1/2, but our c is h/(4π). If h is taken as 2π (in natural units, perhaps), then h/(4π) = (2π)/(4π) )= 1/2. So in that case, the eigenvalues are ±1/2. So in the determinant equation, a² = (1/2)^2, so a= ±1/2. So this would match option B.

Wait, but h is Planck's constant, which is about 6.626e-34 J s, but in the equation, c is h/(4π). So if in the problem statement, the matrix S is given as part of the operator, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±1/2. Let me think.

Wait, but the actual value of c is h/(4π), but the eigenvalues are ±c. So if c is h/(4π), and h is in terms of units where, say, h=2π, then c becomes (2π)/(4π)= 1/2. So the eigenvalues would be a=±1/2.

But without knowing the units, I can't be sure. Wait, but the problem states that the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix σy. So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) σy. But the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ± h/(4π). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π). So (h/(4π)) is equal to ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are real and equal to ± ħ/2. So now, looking at the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh. That can't be right, since the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, if ħ is 1, then eigenvalues are ±1/2. So if the problem uses units where ħ=1, then the eigenvalues are ±1/2, which would make option B correct. But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps this is a possible scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is given in terms of σy scaled by a factor. Let me re-express Ay.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±1/2 if the operator is (σy)/2. Because σy has eigenvalues ±1, so (σy)/2 has eigenvalues ±1/2.

Wait, wait the problem says Ay = c * S, and S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is σy. So if c is 1/2, then Ay would be (σy)/2, which has eigenvalues ±1/2. So if c is 1/2, then option B is correct.

But in our problem, c is h/(4π). Let me compute c in terms of ħ.

Since ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ.

Then c = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) σy.

The eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2.

So the real parts are ± ħ/2, and the imaginary parts are zero. So none of the options A or B are correct because they all mention non-zero imaginary parts.

So looking back at the options, perhaps option C is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Wait, because A² is the square of the spin, which commutes with Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0, since A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components.

But for Az, the z-component doesn't commute with Ay. Because [Ay, Az] = i ħ Ax (by angular momentum commutation relations), so they don't commute. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

I'm not exactly clear on what this means. The basis functions of the matrix operator would probably refer to the eigenvectors forming the basis for the space. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if distinct) span the space, so they form a basis. So statement D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I think that makes sense because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors (if they are two distinct eigenvalues) form a basis. So the statement D is correct.

But then, which of the statements is correct. So the possible correct options are C and D.

Wait, but let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps in the process, which statement would hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, another approach: Let's see what the options are:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is S² (since A is the angular momentum), which is the same as (ħ/2)^2 σy^2 = (ħ^2/4) I, because σy² = I.

So A² has eigenvalues (ħ^2/4) for any state, since σy² is identity. So any eigenstate of Ay will also be an eigenstate of A². So statement C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space, which is correct because a 2x2 matrix has two eigenvectors (assuming distinct eigenvalues), which are orthogonal, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation, so perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, I can only choose one.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the matrix operator has the form Ay = c S, with c = h/(4π), and S as given. So the matrix is 2x2, so it's a spin-½ system. The eigenfunctions are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction. These are the basis vectors for the space. So D would be correct because any 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues has eigenvectors forming a basis.

But perhaps the question is about whether the eigenvectors are the same as the basis functions of the matrix. But the basis functions of the matrix operator would be its eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem gives four options, and I have to choose which is correct.

So, reviewing:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π) = ± ħ/2. So they are real. So options A and B, which involve imaginary parts, are incorrect.

Option C: Correct, because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let's look again at the matrix S. S is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is σy, so it's Hermitian. So Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So in this case, the eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis for the 2D space. So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct, because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

But wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are its basis. So D is correct.

But the problem is in the options, I have to choose which statement is correct. So options C and D seem correct. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem is about the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So A is the angular momentum operator. So A² would be (S)^2, which for a spin-½ particle is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * 3 σ·σ, but no, wait, no, S² for spin-½ is (ħ/2)^2 * 3? No, wait, for a spin-½ particle, S² = ( (s(s+1) ) ) ħ², where s=½. So S² = ( (½)(½+1) ) ħ² = (3/4) ħ².

But regardless, A² has the same eigenvalue for all states. So any eigenstate of Ay would be an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So which one is the correct statement?

The statement in option C is correct, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D is also correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. The eigenfunctions of Ay are a basis because the operator is 2x2 and has two orthogonal eigenvectors. So option D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct because D is perhaps not exactly correct.

Wait, the statement in option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is 2x2, and the basis functions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2x2 space. So the statement is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct, so perhaps options C and D are both correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps another option is better.

Wait, looking back, the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π) which is ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, which makes options A and B incorrect. So the correct statements would be C and D.

But looking at the options given, perhaps only C is correct. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. That's correct.

So if both are correct, but the problem gives only one correct option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but the problem says 'which statement below will you consider to be correct?' So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, in the problem, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σy, which is Hermitian. So the operator Ay is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

But in a spin-½ system, the eigenstates of Sy are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

So perhaps the correct options are C and D.

But since the options are exclusive, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the matrix operator's eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct.

Wait, but let's look at the problem again. The question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the given options don't have that, so perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about the matrix operator's basis. The basis functions of the matrix operator might refer to the matrix's own basis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix operator has eigenvectors that form an orthonormal basis, which is true.

So given the options, the correct statements are C and D. But since the problem expects only one correct option, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but looking again, the provided options are:

A) Incorrect because eigenvalues are real.

B) Incorrect.

C) Correct.

D) Correct.

But since the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, perhaps the intended correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But looking back, the problem statement gives only one correct option, so perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, as the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct because the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix form a basis for the space.

So both statements C and D are correct, but the problem gives these as separate options. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about what "basis functions of the matrix operator" means. The matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors are a basis for the vector space, so D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the problem expects only one option.

But I'm probably overcomplicating this. Let me try to think what the question is asking. It's about which statement is correct during the calculation.

In the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues, I find they are real, so any option that talks about imaginary parts is out. So A and B are incorrect.

Between C and D, both seem correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is C, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

But in that case, the correct answer would be D. But since I'm not sure, perhaps I should rely on the process.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the operator \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \):
   \[
   \det \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix} = a^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = a^2 + \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
   \]
   Solving \( a^2 = -\left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 \), the eigenvalues are:
   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]
   These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Hermiticity of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is Hermitian (\( S^\dagger = S \)), and since \( c \) is real, \( A_y \) is also Hermitian. This ensures real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) or \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), but \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of a 2×2 Hermitian matrix with distinct eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis for the 2D space.

5. **Final Decision:**
   Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for the statement that is "correct during the calculation," and option C is more directly relevant to the properties of eigenfunctions and their relationship with other components of the angular momentum operator.

### Conclusion

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the fact that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

Answer: C
