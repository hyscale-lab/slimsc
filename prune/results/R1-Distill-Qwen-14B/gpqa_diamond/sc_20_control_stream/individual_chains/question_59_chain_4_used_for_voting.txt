Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will also dissociate completely. 

Let me think about the steps. I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first, then see if they neutralize each other. The leftover moles will determine the pH.

So, for each solution:

1. Calculate moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute H+ but only partially. But wait, when mixed with a strong base, maybe the base will neutralize some of the acid. Hmm, maybe I should consider the reactions first.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 will provide 2 moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole of H+.

So let's calculate the moles:

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since it's HCl, that's 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acid and base, they react: H+ + OH- → H2O. So I should find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

But wait, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. However, because CH3COOH is weak, but HCl is strong. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The CH3COOH will provide some H+, but perhaps it's negligible compared to the strong acid? Or maybe not? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe we should first consider the reaction between the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Because both are strong, they will completely neutralize each other.

So let's see: moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

They react in a 1:1 ratio. So the H+ will neutralize some of the OH-.

Wait, wait no, H+ and OH- react to form H2O. So the total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH, but CH3COOH's H+ is weak, so maybe we can calculate the neutralization first between the strong acid and strong base, then see what's left, and then consider the weak acid.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate total H+ from strong acids (HCl) and weak acids (CH3COOH).

2. Calculate total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

3. Subtract OH- from H+ to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write down the steps.

First, find the volumes and moles of each:

CH3COOH: 500 mL = 0.5 L; 0.1 M → 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL → 0.4 L; 0.2 M → 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL → 0.3 L; 0.3 M → 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from HCl (0.08) and the OH- (0.18) will react.

Wait, but the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, which is a base, and H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Let me think: the OH- will neutralize H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's not as strong as HCl. So perhaps the strong acid will neutralize the OH- first, and then the remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid.

Wait, no, because the H+ comes from both, and OH- is a strong base. So the OH- will react with all available H+.

Wait, but the H+ from HCl is strong, so it will react first. Let me think: the OH- will react with H+ from HCl, and any remaining OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH.

So first, calculate how much OH- is needed to neutralize HCl.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+. OH- is 0.18 mol. So OH- can neutralize all of the H+ from HCl, and have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH- left.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have excess OH-, any remaining OH- would come from the strong base after neutralizing the H+ from the strong acid. But in addition, the weak acid might contribute some H+.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it's a source of H+ which will react with OH- first. After that, any remaining OH- would react with the weak acid (CH3COOH), but since CH3COOH is weak, perhaps it can't donate as much H+. Or wait, the OH- might deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So let me calculate:

Total H+ from strong acid (HCl): 0.08 mol.

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

So, all the H+ from HCl (0.08) will react with 0.08 mol of OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, that 0.10 mol of OH- will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when OH- is added, it will deprotonate it. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. How much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 mol.

So, the OH- is 0.10 mol. So the OH- can react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH is only 0.05 mol.

So after that, the OH- will have reacted with all of the CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when we add OH-, it will deprotonate it, but only as much as possible. So if OH- is in excess after neutralizing the HCl, then it will also consume the CH3COOH.

So the total OH- after neutralizing everything will be 0.18 (from Ba(OH)2) minus 0.08 (HCl) = 0.10, but then that 0.10 reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), meaning all CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 mol of OH- remains.

Wait, but wait: the initial OH- is 0.18. It neutralizes 0.08 H+ from HCl → 0.10 left. Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), consuming all CH3COOH and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the net is 0.05 mol OH- in the solution.

Wait, but what about the total volume of the solution? Because all the solutions are mixed together. The total volume is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait. No, because the solution is now a mixture of all three, and the OH- is in excess. So the solution is basic because OH- is left.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure.

So the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol H+ neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Then OH- reacts with CH3COOH: CH3COOH (0.05 mol) is neutralized, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the total moles of OH- in solution is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that would make the pH around 12.62, which is option A. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

CH3COOH: 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol OH-.

So when mixed, H+ and OH- combine.

H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

They neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then this OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, which can neutralize 0.05 OH-.

So after that, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So total OH- is 0.05 in 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 → option A.

But wait, another thought: after the OH- neutralizes the HCl and the CH3COOH, is there any excess H+ left?

Because if any H+ remains after OH- is consumed, the solution would be acidic. But in this case, all OH- was used up, and perhaps there's more H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, no. Because the OH- neutralizes some of the CH3COOH, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when you add OH- to CH3COOH, it converts some of it into its conjugate base (acetate ion).

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is 0.05 mol, same as CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH is converted into acetate, and all the OH- is consumed.

So the solution would have no excess H+ or OH-, except what's left from the strong base and strong acid.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- was in excess after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH. So the solution is basic.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and total OH- after considering all reactions.

Wait, let me think in terms of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: strong acid → 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: weak acid → let's say it contributes 'x' mol H+.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol.

So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.08 + x, and the OH- is 0.18.

They will react:

min(0.08 + x, 0.18) will neutralize, and the excess will determine the pH.

But x is the H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid.

Wait, but in this scenario, the total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) plus whatever CH3COOH can provide. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't release much H+ unless it's in solution.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH- would deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct: OH- neutralizes the strong acid's H+, then deprotonates the weak acid.

So, after step 1: OH- neutralizes HCl → 0.08 H+ neutralized, 0.10 OH- left.

Then, step 2: OH- neutralizes CH3COOH → 0.05 OH- used, 0.05 OH- left.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 in 1.2 L → [OH-] = 0.0417 M.

pOH ≈ 1.38 → pH ≈ 12.62 → option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62. That makes sense.

But another angle: perhaps I should consider that the solution after mixing contains both Ba^2+ and acetate ions, which might form a buffer, but I don't think so because the Ba(OH)2 is in excess.

Wait, no, wait. The Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^-.

But in the solution, after reactions, if there's excess OH-, then the solution is basic, and the pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration.

Thus, the correct pH is 12.62, which is option A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH:**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     CH₃COOH is a weak acid and will only partially dissociate, but its contribution to H⁺ is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl.

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**  
   The strong acid (HCl) reacts with the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) in a 1:1 molar ratio:  
   \[
   \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]  
   - Total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Total OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
     After neutralization, \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]  
   - Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     All \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) is neutralized, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

4. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**  
   The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**  
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let's see. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Wait, but wait a second. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So it doesn't dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will also dissociate completely. 

Let me think about the steps. I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first, then see if they neutralize each other. The leftover moles will determine the pH.

So, for each solution:

1. Calculate moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute H+ but only partially. But wait, when mixed with a strong base, maybe the base will neutralize some of the acid. Hmm, maybe I should consider the reactions first.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 will provide 2 moles of OH- because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives 1 mole of H+.

So let's calculate the moles:

CH3COOH: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since it's HCl, that's 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acid and base, they react: H+ + OH- → H2O. So I should find the total moles of H+ and OH-.

But wait, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. However, because CH3COOH is weak, but HCl is strong. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The CH3COOH will provide some H+, but perhaps it's negligible compared to the strong acid? Or maybe not? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe we should first consider the reaction between the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Because both are strong, they will completely neutralize each other.

So let's see: moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

They react in a 1:1 ratio. So the H+ will neutralize some of the OH-.

Wait, wait no, H+ and OH- react to form H2O. So the total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH, but CH3COOH's H+ is weak, so maybe we can calculate the neutralization first between the strong acid and strong base, then see what's left, and then consider the weak acid.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate total H+ from strong acids (HCl) and weak acids (CH3COOH).

2. Calculate total OH- from Ba(OH)2.

3. Subtract OH- from H+ to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

But I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write down the steps.

First, find the volumes and moles of each:

CH3COOH: 500 mL = 0.5 L; 0.1 M → 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL → 0.4 L; 0.2 M → 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL → 0.3 L; 0.3 M → 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from HCl (0.08) and the OH- (0.18) will react.

Wait, but the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, which is a base, and H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Let me think: the OH- will neutralize H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's not as strong as HCl. So perhaps the strong acid will neutralize the OH- first, and then the remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid.

Wait, no, because the H+ comes from both, and OH- is a strong base. So the OH- will react with all available H+.

Wait, but the H+ from HCl is strong, so it will react first. Let me think: the OH- will react with H+ from HCl, and any remaining OH- will react with H+ from CH3COOH.

So first, calculate how much OH- is needed to neutralize HCl.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+. OH- is 0.18 mol. So OH- can neutralize all of the H+ from HCl, and have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH- left.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have excess OH-, any remaining OH- would come from the strong base after neutralizing the H+ from the strong acid. But in addition, the weak acid might contribute some H+.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it's a source of H+ which will react with OH- first. After that, any remaining OH- would react with the weak acid (CH3COOH), but since CH3COOH is weak, perhaps it can't donate as much H+. Or wait, the OH- might deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So let me calculate:

Total H+ from strong acid (HCl): 0.08 mol.

Total OH-: 0.18 mol.

So, all the H+ from HCl (0.08) will react with 0.08 mol of OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, that 0.10 mol of OH- will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when OH- is added, it will deprotonate it. So the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. How much CH3COOH do we have? 0.05 mol.

So, the OH- is 0.10 mol. So the OH- can react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH. Because CH3COOH is only 0.05 mol.

So after that, the OH- will have reacted with all of the CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when we add OH-, it will deprotonate it, but only as much as possible. So if OH- is in excess after neutralizing the HCl, then it will also consume the CH3COOH.

So the total OH- after neutralizing everything will be 0.18 (from Ba(OH)2) minus 0.08 (HCl) = 0.10, but then that 0.10 reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), meaning all CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 mol of OH- remains.

Wait, but wait: the initial OH- is 0.18. It neutralizes 0.08 H+ from HCl → 0.10 left. Then, this 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), consuming all CH3COOH and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the net is 0.05 mol OH- in the solution.

Wait, but what about the total volume of the solution? Because all the solutions are mixed together. The total volume is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approximately 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait. No, because the solution is now a mixture of all three, and the OH- is in excess. So the solution is basic because OH- is left.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure.

So the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. OH- neutralizes H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol H+ neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Then OH- reacts with CH3COOH: CH3COOH (0.05 mol) is neutralized, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the total moles of OH- in solution is 0.05.

Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but that would make the pH around 12.62, which is option A. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

CH3COOH: 0.1 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol OH-.

So when mixed, H+ and OH- combine.

H+ from HCl: 0.08.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

They neutralize each other: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH- → 0.08 H2O.

Remaining OH-: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then this OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, which can neutralize 0.05 OH-.

So after that, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So total OH- is 0.05 in 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 → option A.

But wait, another thought: after the OH- neutralizes the HCl and the CH3COOH, is there any excess H+ left?

Because if any H+ remains after OH- is consumed, the solution would be acidic. But in this case, all OH- was used up, and perhaps there's more H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, no. Because the OH- neutralizes some of the CH3COOH, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So when you add OH- to CH3COOH, it converts some of it into its conjugate base (acetate ion).

Wait, but in this case, the OH- is 0.05 mol, same as CH3COOH. So all the CH3COOH is converted into acetate, and all the OH- is consumed.

So the solution would have no excess H+ or OH-, except what's left from the strong base and strong acid.

Wait, but in this case, the OH- was in excess after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH. So the solution is basic.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and total OH- after considering all reactions.

Wait, let me think in terms of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: strong acid → 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: weak acid → let's say it contributes 'x' mol H+.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol.

So the reaction is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.08 + x, and the OH- is 0.18.

They will react:

min(0.08 + x, 0.18) will neutralize, and the excess will determine the pH.

But x is the H+ from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid.

Wait, but in this scenario, the total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) plus whatever CH3COOH can provide. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't release much H+ unless it's in solution.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, the OH- would deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct: OH- neutralizes the strong acid's H+, then deprotonates the weak acid.

So, after step 1: OH- neutralizes HCl → 0.08 H+ neutralized, 0.10 OH- left.

Then, step 2: OH- neutralizes CH3COOH → 0.05 OH- used, 0.05 OH- left.

So the remaining OH- is 0.05 in 1.2 L → [OH-] = 0.0417 M.

pOH ≈ 1.38 → pH ≈ 12.62 → option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 12.62. That makes sense.

But another angle: perhaps I should consider that the solution after mixing contains both Ba^2+ and acetate ions, which might form a buffer, but I don't think so because the Ba(OH)2 is in excess.

Wait, no, wait. The Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^-.

But in the solution, after reactions, if there's excess OH-, then the solution is basic, and the pH is determined by the excess OH- concentration.

Thus, the correct pH is 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is a strong acid, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **CH₃COOH:**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     CH₃COOH is a weak acid and will only partially dissociate, but its contribution to H⁺ is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl.

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**  
   The strong acid (HCl) reacts with the strong base (Ba(OH)₂) in a 1:1 molar ratio:  
   \[
   \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]  
   - Total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Total OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
     After neutralization, \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
   \[
   \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
   \]  
   - Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     All \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \) is neutralized, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

4. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**  
   The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
   \[
   [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of OH}^-}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**  
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to option A.
