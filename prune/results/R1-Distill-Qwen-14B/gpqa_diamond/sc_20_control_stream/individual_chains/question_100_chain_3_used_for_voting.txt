Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about a series of organic reactions, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products. Let's break it down.

Starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, that's usually a sign of an addition reaction, which makes me think it's propene. Because cyclopropane is more likely to undergo substitution reactions, but I'm not entirely sure. So, if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3), then bromination in CCl4 would add bromine across the double bond. So that would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene has the double bond between C1 and C2, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you have two adjacent bromine atoms, elimination would form an alkene. The reaction would produce propene again, but wait, where's the hydrogen coming from? Oh, wait, it's dehydrohalogenation. So, when we eliminate HBr twice, we get back propene. So compound C is propene.

Next, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube. I think that's a dehydrogenation reaction, where propene is converted into propyne. Because heating alkenes with iron usually causes dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So compound D is propyne (HC≡CCH3).

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here. Two strong acids, maybe sulfuric and nitric? Or perhaps it's something else. Wait, another possibility is that propyne undergoes hydration. But when I think about the products, if D is propyne, adding H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst (like H2SO4) would give ketone. Wait, no, propyne (HC≡CCH3) would upon hydration (with HgSO4 and H2SO4) give acetone (propan-2-one). So compound E would be acetone.

Now, compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl usually produce H2 gas. But in the presence of an acid and iron, maybe it's a reduction reaction. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. If we treat it with HCl and Fe, perhaps it's a Birch reduction or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is reduced. Wait, another thought: when ketones react with HCl and Fe, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3) after reduction. Alternatively, if it's a different reaction, I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: perhaps iron is acting as a reducing agent. If E is acetone, then maybe it's being reduced to propanol? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, wait, another option: maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation. No, that wouldn't make sense because E is a ketone. Or perhaps it's a Grignard reaction? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe E is reacting in a different way. Let me think again. E is acetone. Iron and HCl together might not directly react with acetone. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a different type of reaction. Oh! Maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for arenes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves diols. Wait, perhaps E is a ketone, and the reaction is something else. Maybe it's a reduction. Oh! The question says "compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F." So, if E is acetone, maybe it's being reduced to propane. Because the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) under cold, acidic conditions. But wait, nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts. But if F is propane, which is an alkane, I don't think it would react with nitrous acid. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe F is something else. Let me retrace my steps.

Wait, perhaps when E is treated with iron and HCl, it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a hydroboration or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. But propyne is an alkyne, so perhaps with H2SO4 and another acid, it would form something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydration. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would add water to form acetone (propan-2-one) as E. So that part seems right.

Then E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is converted into an alcohol. Oh wait, no. Wait, under certain conditions, maybe the ketone is being reduced. So perhaps F is propanol? But propanol has an -OH group. How would that reaction proceed? Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for a different type of reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is undergoing a different kind of reaction when reacted with Fe and HCl. Wait, perhaps it's reacting with HCl to form an acid derivative. Or maybe it's a halogenation. Wait, maybe it's not a reduction. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit because E is a ketone, not an alkyne. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think again.

Wait, when D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Another thought: perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but in a different way. Wait, propyne would typically give acetone upon catalytic hydration. But if it's a different acid, perhaps it would give a different product. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydration with H2O and H+ to form the ketone. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Oh! Wait a second. Maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is being converted into a secondary alcohol. But how? Iron and HCl usually don't reduce ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroformylation? No, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a Birch reduction. But Birch reduces aromatic rings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Maybe D is reacting with two strong acids to form something else. Another possibility: when propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacts with H2SO4 and another acid, maybe it's adding H2O across the triple bond. So that would give propanol. But wait, that's for hydration. So E would be propan-1-ol or propan-2-ol? Propyne hydrating would give either prop-1-en-2-ol (allyl alcohol) or maybe the more substituted one, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe propyne is treated with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3. Wait, that could be for nitrating or sulfonating, but for a triple bond, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but for alkynes, dihydroxylation would give a vicinal diol. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would form HOCH2CH2OH? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, when propyne is treated with acid, perhaps it's adding two H+ and two OH groups. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed further and see what comes next. Let's assume E is acetone, and F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But propane is an alkane, and I don't think it reacts with nitrous acid. So this suggests that I might have made an error earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps F is something else. Let's think again. If E is acetone and I'm treating it with Fe and HCl, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, though. So maybe it's being reduced to propane. So F would be propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So that would be a problem because the next step requires F to react with nitrous acid to form G.

Wait, perhaps F is a primary amine. Because nitrous acid reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. But if F is a primary amine, how did it come from E (a ketone) and Fe/HCl? That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe F is an aldehyde. Wait, acetone can't be directly converted into an aldehyde via Fe and HCl as far as I know.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

Starting over: A is C3H6, which is propene. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's elimination, so it should form an alkene. Wait, but when you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form propene again. So C is propene.

Then, propene passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's dehydrogenation to form propyne (D). Then, D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Wait, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3. What reaction occurs when an alkyne is treated with concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids? Maybe it's a nitrating agent. But propyne is an alkyne, and nitrating an alkyne would give a nitro compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration reaction to form a ketone, which would be acetone.

Assuming E is acetone, then E is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. If it's the Clemmensen reduction, F would be propane. Then F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. But propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So that would be impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe D is not propyne. Let me think again. If A is propene, bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then elimination gives propene (C). Then, through a red-hot iron, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, propene + heat with Fe could be a dehydrohalogenation again, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form another diene or something else. Or perhaps the process is forming something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Let me think differently. Maybe compound C is another product. Let's see, after elimination of B (1,2-dibromopropane) with alcoholic KOH, you get propene as C. Then, passing through red-hot iron might not form an alkyne but a diene. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Dehydrogenation would take away two H's to form an alkyne (propyne). So D is propyne.

So then, D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Let's say H2SO4 and another, perhaps HNO3. Nitrating propyne might add a nitro group. But I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration to form acetone (E).

Then, E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl to form F. If it's a reduction, F would be propane. But then, F (propane) doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps when propyne is treated with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Like adding H2O across the triple bond under acidic conditions. So propyne would become propanol. But which alcohol? Propyne is HC≡CCH3; adding H2O would give either 1-propanol or 2-propanol. Wait, in acid, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) would typically give 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol), because the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The addition of water would form (CH3)2CHOH, which is 2-propanol.

So E would be 2-propanol. Then, E (2-propanol) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm, what's that reaction? If 2-propanol is treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but 2-propanol doesn't have a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction. But 2-propanol is already an alcohol; perhaps it's being oxidized. Wait, but Fe and HCl don't typically oxidize alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but that would require H2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the next step. E is 2-propanol, and F is formed. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts, but if F is not an amine, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, if F is a secondary amine, but then nitrous acid would form N-nitrous compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to look at the options to see if any hint is there. The options are about the products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Well, if F is propane, that's unlikely. Propane is a gas, not used for dyes. So if A is incorrect, then F must be something else. Alternatively, if F is something like aniline or a compound used in dyes, then A would be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride in solution is used for the benzidine test for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would cause the solution to turn yellow. So if H is phenol, then B is correct. But I don't know yet.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne, which has a structure of HC≡CCH3. The protons on the triple bond (if any) would be a singlet, but wait, propyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, propyne is HC≡C-CH3? No, wait, propyne is actually CH3-C≡CH, right? So the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the CH3 group is on one end, and the H is on the other.

In the NMR, the protons on CH3 and the H on the other end. The CH3 group would be a triplet? No, wait. The triple bond in propyne is between C2 and C3. Wait, no, propyne is HC≡C-CH3? No, actually, prop-1-yne is HC≡C-CH3. So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. So the CH3 and the CH (the H) are on either end of the triple bond.

In that structure, the CH3 protons are all equivalent and would be a singlet. The H on the other end is also a singlet because it's connected to a triple bond. So in the 1H NMR, you'd have two singlets: one from the CH3 and one from the H. Therefore, option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at standard conditions. Propene is indeed a flammable gas, so D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that's not true. Let's see.

If I go back, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let's try to figure out all the compounds again.

A: C3H6 is propene (CH2=CHCH3)

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)

C: propene (CH2=CHCH3) after elimination (since B was 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr twice forms propene again)

D: propyne (CH3-C≡CH), as formed by dehydrogenation of propene with red-hot iron.

E: when propyne (D) reacts with two strong acids, let's think. Let's say it's H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a nitration reaction. Propyne is an alkyne; nitrating it would substitute a nitro group. But where? The triple bond is between C1 and C2. So the possible product would be nitropropyne. So E would be CH3-C≡C-NO2? Or perhaps the nitro group attaches to one end.

Wait, but nitrating an alkyne is not as straightforward as nitrating an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, as I thought before, via hydration.

If E is acetone (propan-2-one), then F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3) via Clemmensen reduction. Then, F is propane. But then how does F react with nitrous acid to form G? Propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So this suggests an error in my earlier steps.

Wait, another thought: maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a hydration to form E. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl (maybe in a different setup) to form F. If E is acetone, and the reaction is with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. So F would be propane.

Then, F is propane. Propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the sequence is incorrect, and I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps when propyne is treated with two strong acids, it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne is an alkyne, and hydrohalogenation would require HX, like HCl. But in this case, it's a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and HCl. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps propyne is undergoing a hydration to form E as 2-propanol.

Wait, let's think. If E is 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3), then when it's treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But 2-propanol's hydroxyl group isn't a good leaving group under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's oxidized. But HCl and Fe don't typically oxidize alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction. Wait, 2-propanol can't be reduced further. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is propionaldehyde. How? If D is propyne, and it undergoes some kind of oxidation. Wait, strong acids may cause oxidation. Maybe E is propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO). Then, F would come from reacting propionaldehyde with Fe and HCl. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reactions again.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about G and H. G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is propane, it can't react with nitrous acid, which suggests that F must be something else. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about E.

Wait, maybe E is propanaldehyde. How? Let's think. If D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne would add HCl to form CH2Cl-C≡CH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihalogenation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely wrong about D. Maybe D is something else. Let's think again. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? I thought it's dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. But maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility: propene might undergo a cracking reaction, but that would break it into smaller molecules, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, that's not correct. Propane isn't used for dyes. But if F is something else, like aniline, then A would be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. That suggests H is phenol, which would indicate that F reacted with nitrous acid to form something that upon treating with NaOH gives phenol. Not sure.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. As I thought earlier, D is propyne (CH3-C≡CH), so two singlets. So C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be either A or B. Let me think about F and G again.

If E is acetone, F is propane. Then, F can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps E is not acetone. Maybe E is something else.

Wait, perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Let's say, for example, the acid is H2SO4 and another acid like HNO3. Maybe D is reacting to form a nitro compound. So E could be CH3-C≡C-NO2. Then, E would be nitropropyne.

Then, E (nitropropyne) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm, perhaps a reduction. Fe and HCl might reduce the nitro group. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So F would be CH3-C≡C-NH2, which is propylidene amine or something. Then, F is an alkyne with an amine group.

Then, F (CH3-C≡C-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. So G would be the diazonium salt of F. Then, G reacts with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenol or other products, depending on conditions.

Wait, but if F is CH3-C≡C-NH2, then G would be the diazonium chloride. When G is treated with NaOH, the diazonium group could hydrolyze to a hydroxyl group. So H would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But wait, that's an alkyne with a hydroxyl group, which is a terminal alkyne alcohol.

But would H give a yellow color with FeCl3? FeCl3 reacts with phenolic OH groups to give a yellow color. So if H is CH3-C≡C-OH, it's not a phenol. So H wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a color. Thus, option B would be incorrect. So option B would be the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me go back. If E is nitropropyne, then F is an amine. Then, G is the diazonium salt. Then, H is the product after treatment with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, in aqueous solution, they can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids or phenols if the amine was aromatic. But F's amine is not aromatic, so H would not be a phenol. So option B is incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in this line of reasoning.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's think about each product and the options.

If F is propane, then option A is incorrect because propane isn't used for dye synthesis. But if F is something else, like benzyl chloride or another compound used in dyes, then A is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe E is benzaldehyde. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to list all the compounds again:

A: propene → B: 1,2-dibromopropane → C: propene → D: propyne → E: acetone → F: propane → G: ? → H: ?

Wait, if F is propane and can't react with nitrous acid, this sequence is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in E and F.

Another possibility: Maybe E is propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO). So after D (propyne) is treated with something to form E as aldehyde. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F as propane. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is propyl chloride. But I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe E is 1-propanol. Then, F could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is different. Let me think about the reactions again.

Wait, when propyne (HC≡CCH3) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and another acid, maybe it's a hydration to form propylene oxide? No, that's more for epoxidation, which usually requires peracids.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne would add HCl to form CH2Cl-C≡CH. Then, E would be CH2Cl-C≡CH. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe it's a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I might not get all the steps right and focus on the options. Let's see.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3, implying H is a phenol. But if H is CH3-C≡C-OH (from earlier), it's an alkyne alcohol, not a phenol. So option B would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if H is a phenol, then option B is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the last step. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If G is a diazonium salt, and H is phenol, then perhaps in the reaction, the diazonium group is replaced by OH. But that would require the amine to be aromatic. For example, aniline (benzenamine) would form a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would give phenol. So if F is aniline, then G is the diazonium salt, and H is phenol. Thus, option B would be correct because phenol gives a yellow color with FeCl3.

But how would F be aniline? Let's see.

If E is benzene, then F could be aniline. But how would E become benzene? Let's retrace.

Wait, E again. D is propyne, which upon reaction with two strong acids could form benzene? Unlikely. So perhaps E is benzaldehyde, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off track. Maybe the reaction sequence is different. For example, perhaps the initial bromination is not addition but substitution. If A is cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4 would give bromocyclopropane. Then, elimination would form something else. But this is getting too speculative.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the incorrect statement is option B, because H is not a phenol, hence doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with compound A, identified as propene (C3H6). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of HBr, regenerating propene (compound C). Passing propene through a red-hot iron tube dehydrogenates it to form propyne (compound D). 

When propyne reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, hydration occurs to form acetone (compound E). Treatment of acetone with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid reduces it via the Clemmensen reduction to propane (compound F). Propane, however, does not react with nitrous acid, creating a conflict in the sequence. Assuming the reaction sequence is correct, the subsequent steps involve F reacting with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacting with sodium hydroxide to form H.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect, as propane is not used for dye synthesis. However, if F were a different compound (e.g., aniline), this could be correct.  
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This implies H is a phenol. However, based on the reaction sequence, H is unlikely to be phenol, as no aromatic ring is introduced in the steps.  
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. Propyne (CH3-C≡CH) has two distinct sets of protons: the CH3 group and the terminal H, both appearing as singlets in the NMR spectrum. This is correct.  
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. Propene (C) is a flammable gas, making this correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as H is not a phenol and does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride. 

Answer: B

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about a series of organic reactions, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products. Let's break it down.

Starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But since the next reaction is bromination in CCl4, that's usually a sign of an addition reaction, which makes me think it's propene. Because cyclopropane is more likely to undergo substitution reactions, but I'm not entirely sure. So, if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3), then bromination in CCl4 would add bromine across the double bond. So that would form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene has the double bond between C1 and C2, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you have two adjacent bromine atoms, elimination would form an alkene. The reaction would produce propene again, but wait, where's the hydrogen coming from? Oh, wait, it's dehydrohalogenation. So, when we eliminate HBr twice, we get back propene. So compound C is propene.

Next, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube. I think that's a dehydrogenation reaction, where propene is converted into propyne. Because heating alkenes with iron usually causes dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. So compound D is propyne (HC≡CCH3).

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here. Two strong acids, maybe sulfuric and nitric? Or perhaps it's something else. Wait, another possibility is that propyne undergoes hydration. But when I think about the products, if D is propyne, adding H2O in the presence of an acid catalyst (like H2SO4) would give ketone. Wait, no, propyne (HC≡CCH3) would upon hydration (with HgSO4 and H2SO4) give acetone (propan-2-one). So compound E would be acetone.

Now, compound E reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl usually produce H2 gas. But in the presence of an acid and iron, maybe it's a reduction reaction. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. If we treat it with HCl and Fe, perhaps it's a Birch reduction or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is reduced. Wait, another thought: when ketones react with HCl and Fe, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3) after reduction. Alternatively, if it's a different reaction, I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility: perhaps iron is acting as a reducing agent. If E is acetone, then maybe it's being reduced to propanol? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, wait, another option: maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation. No, that wouldn't make sense because E is a ketone. Or perhaps it's a Grignard reaction? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe E is reacting in a different way. Let me think again. E is acetone. Iron and HCl together might not directly react with acetone. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a different type of reaction. Oh! Maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for arenes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves diols. Wait, perhaps E is a ketone, and the reaction is something else. Maybe it's a reduction. Oh! The question says "compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms compound F." So, if E is acetone, maybe it's being reduced to propane. Because the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes. So F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Then, compound F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) under cold, acidic conditions. But wait, nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts. But if F is propane, which is an alkane, I don't think it would react with nitrous acid. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe F is something else. Let me retrace my steps.

Wait, perhaps when E is treated with iron and HCl, it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a hydroboration or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

Wait, maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. But propyne is an alkyne, so perhaps with H2SO4 and another acid, it would form something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydration. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would add water to form acetone (propan-2-one) as E. So that part seems right.

Then E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is converted into an alcohol. Oh wait, no. Wait, under certain conditions, maybe the ketone is being reduced. So perhaps F is propanol? But propanol has an -OH group. How would that reaction proceed? Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for a different type of reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps E is undergoing a different kind of reaction when reacted with Fe and HCl. Wait, perhaps it's reacting with HCl to form an acid derivative. Or maybe it's a halogenation. Wait, maybe it's not a reduction. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but that doesn't fit because E is a ketone, not an alkyne. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think again.

Wait, when D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Another thought: perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but in a different way. Wait, propyne would typically give acetone upon catalytic hydration. But if it's a different acid, perhaps it would give a different product. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydration with H2O and H+ to form the ketone. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl to form F. Oh! Wait a second. Maybe it's a reaction where the ketone is being converted into a secondary alcohol. But how? Iron and HCl usually don't reduce ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroformylation? No, that's for alkenes. Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's a Birch reduction. But Birch reduces aromatic rings. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Maybe D is reacting with two strong acids to form something else. Another possibility: when propyne (HC≡CCH3) reacts with H2SO4 and another acid, maybe it's adding H2O across the triple bond. So that would give propanol. But wait, that's for hydration. So E would be propan-1-ol or propan-2-ol? Propyne hydrating would give either prop-1-en-2-ol (allyl alcohol) or maybe the more substituted one, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe propyne is treated with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3. Wait, that could be for nitrating or sulfonating, but for a triple bond, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but for alkynes, dihydroxylation would give a vicinal diol. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would form HOCH2CH2OH? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, when propyne is treated with acid, perhaps it's adding two H+ and two OH groups. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed further and see what comes next. Let's assume E is acetone, and F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But propane is an alkane, and I don't think it reacts with nitrous acid. So this suggests that I might have made an error earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps F is something else. Let's think again. If E is acetone and I'm treating it with Fe and HCl, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, though. So maybe it's being reduced to propane. So F would be propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So that would be a problem because the next step requires F to react with nitrous acid to form G.

Wait, perhaps F is a primary amine. Because nitrous acid reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. But if F is a primary amine, how did it come from E (a ketone) and Fe/HCl? That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe F is an aldehyde. Wait, acetone can't be directly converted into an aldehyde via Fe and HCl as far as I know.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

Starting over: A is C3H6, which is propene. Bromination in CCl4 gives 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's elimination, so it should form an alkene. Wait, but when you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form propene again. So C is propene.

Then, propene passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's dehydrogenation to form propyne (D). Then, D reacts with two strong acids to form E. Wait, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3. What reaction occurs when an alkyne is treated with concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids? Maybe it's a nitrating agent. But propyne is an alkyne, and nitrating an alkyne would give a nitro compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration reaction to form a ketone, which would be acetone.

Assuming E is acetone, then E is treated with Fe and HCl to form F. If it's the Clemmensen reduction, F would be propane. Then F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. But propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So that would be impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe D is not propyne. Let me think again. If A is propene, bromination gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Then elimination gives propene (C). Then, through a red-hot iron, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, propene + heat with Fe could be a dehydrohalogenation again, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form another diene or something else. Or perhaps the process is forming something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Let me think differently. Maybe compound C is another product. Let's see, after elimination of B (1,2-dibromopropane) with alcoholic KOH, you get propene as C. Then, passing through red-hot iron might not form an alkyne but a diene. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Dehydrogenation would take away two H's to form an alkyne (propyne). So D is propyne.

So then, D is propyne. Reacting with two strong acids. Let's say H2SO4 and another, perhaps HNO3. Nitrating propyne might add a nitro group. But I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration to form acetone (E).

Then, E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl to form F. If it's a reduction, F would be propane. But then, F (propane) doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps when propyne is treated with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Like adding H2O across the triple bond under acidic conditions. So propyne would become propanol. But which alcohol? Propyne is HC≡CCH3; adding H2O would give either 1-propanol or 2-propanol. Wait, in acid, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) would typically give 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol), because the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The addition of water would form (CH3)2CHOH, which is 2-propanol.

So E would be 2-propanol. Then, E (2-propanol) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm, what's that reaction? If 2-propanol is treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, but 2-propanol doesn't have a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction. But 2-propanol is already an alcohol; perhaps it's being oxidized. Wait, but Fe and HCl don't typically oxidize alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but that would require H2.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the next step. E is 2-propanol, and F is formed. Then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts, but if F is not an amine, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, if F is a secondary amine, but then nitrous acid would form N-nitrous compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me try to look at the options to see if any hint is there. The options are about the products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Well, if F is propane, that's unlikely. Propane is a gas, not used for dyes. So if A is incorrect, then F must be something else. Alternatively, if F is something like aniline or a compound used in dyes, then A would be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride in solution is used for the benzidine test for phenols. If H is a phenol, it would cause the solution to turn yellow. So if H is phenol, then B is correct. But I don't know yet.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne, which has a structure of HC≡CCH3. The protons on the triple bond (if any) would be a singlet, but wait, propyne has a triple bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, propyne is HC≡C-CH3? No, wait, propyne is actually CH3-C≡CH, right? So the structure is CH3-C≡C-H. So the CH3 group is on one end, and the H is on the other.

In the NMR, the protons on CH3 and the H on the other end. The CH3 group would be a triplet? No, wait. The triple bond in propyne is between C2 and C3. Wait, no, propyne is HC≡C-CH3? No, actually, prop-1-yne is HC≡C-CH3. So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. So the CH3 and the CH (the H) are on either end of the triple bond.

In that structure, the CH3 protons are all equivalent and would be a singlet. The H on the other end is also a singlet because it's connected to a triple bond. So in the 1H NMR, you'd have two singlets: one from the CH3 and one from the H. Therefore, option C says D gives two singlets, which would be correct. So option C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at standard conditions. Propene is indeed a flammable gas, so D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that's not true. Let's see.

If I go back, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let's try to figure out all the compounds again.

A: C3H6 is propene (CH2=CHCH3)

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3)

C: propene (CH2=CHCH3) after elimination (since B was 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr twice forms propene again)

D: propyne (CH3-C≡CH), as formed by dehydrogenation of propene with red-hot iron.

E: when propyne (D) reacts with two strong acids, let's think. Let's say it's H2SO4 and HNO3. Maybe it's a nitration reaction. Propyne is an alkyne; nitrating it would substitute a nitro group. But where? The triple bond is between C1 and C2. So the possible product would be nitropropyne. So E would be CH3-C≡C-NO2? Or perhaps the nitro group attaches to one end.

Wait, but nitrating an alkyne is not as straightforward as nitrating an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, as I thought before, via hydration.

If E is acetone (propan-2-one), then F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3) via Clemmensen reduction. Then, F is propane. But then how does F react with nitrous acid to form G? Propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So this suggests an error in my earlier steps.

Wait, another thought: maybe when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a hydration to form E. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl (maybe in a different setup) to form F. If E is acetone, and the reaction is with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. So F would be propane.

Then, F is propane. Propane doesn't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps the sequence is incorrect, and I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps when propyne is treated with two strong acids, it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne is an alkyne, and hydrohalogenation would require HX, like HCl. But in this case, it's a mixture of two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and HCl. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps propyne is undergoing a hydration to form E as 2-propanol.

Wait, let's think. If E is 2-propanol (CH3CHOHCH3), then when it's treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. But 2-propanol's hydroxyl group isn't a good leaving group under those conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's oxidized. But HCl and Fe don't typically oxidize alcohols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction. Wait, 2-propanol can't be reduced further. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is propionaldehyde. How? If D is propyne, and it undergoes some kind of oxidation. Wait, strong acids may cause oxidation. Maybe E is propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO). Then, F would come from reacting propionaldehyde with Fe and HCl. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reactions again.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about G and H. G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If F is propane, it can't react with nitrous acid, which suggests that F must be something else. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about E.

Wait, maybe E is propanaldehyde. How? Let's think. If D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne would add HCl to form CH2Cl-C≡CH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihalogenation, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm completely wrong about D. Maybe D is something else. Let's think again. When propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? I thought it's dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. But maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility: propene might undergo a cracking reaction, but that would break it into smaller molecules, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, that's not correct. Propane isn't used for dyes. But if F is something else, like aniline, then A would be correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. That suggests H is phenol, which would indicate that F reacted with nitrous acid to form something that upon treating with NaOH gives phenol. Not sure.

Option C: D gives two singlets in NMR. As I thought earlier, D is propyne (CH3-C≡CH), so two singlets. So C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So, the incorrect statement would be either A or B. Let me think about F and G again.

If E is acetone, F is propane. Then, F can't react with nitrous acid. So perhaps E is not acetone. Maybe E is something else.

Wait, perhaps when D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids, it's a different reaction. Let's say, for example, the acid is H2SO4 and another acid like HNO3. Maybe D is reacting to form a nitro compound. So E could be CH3-C≡C-NO2. Then, E would be nitropropyne.

Then, E (nitropropyne) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm, perhaps a reduction. Fe and HCl might reduce the nitro group. Nitro groups can be reduced to amines. So F would be CH3-C≡C-NH2, which is propylidene amine or something. Then, F is an alkyne with an amine group.

Then, F (CH3-C≡C-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts. So G would be the diazonium salt of F. Then, G reacts with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenol or other products, depending on conditions.

Wait, but if F is CH3-C≡C-NH2, then G would be the diazonium chloride. When G is treated with NaOH, the diazonium group could hydrolyze to a hydroxyl group. So H would be CH3-C≡C-OH. But wait, that's an alkyne with a hydroxyl group, which is a terminal alkyne alcohol.

But would H give a yellow color with FeCl3? FeCl3 reacts with phenolic OH groups to give a yellow color. So if H is CH3-C≡C-OH, it's not a phenol. So H wouldn't react with FeCl3 to give a color. Thus, option B would be incorrect. So option B would be the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me go back. If E is nitropropyne, then F is an amine. Then, G is the diazonium salt. Then, H is the product after treatment with NaOH. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions. For example, in aqueous solution, they can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids or phenols if the amine was aromatic. But F's amine is not aromatic, so H would not be a phenol. So option B is incorrect because H doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in this line of reasoning.

Alternatively, another approach: Let's think about each product and the options.

If F is propane, then option A is incorrect because propane isn't used for dye synthesis. But if F is something else, like benzyl chloride or another compound used in dyes, then A is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe E is benzaldehyde. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to list all the compounds again:

A: propene → B: 1,2-dibromopropane → C: propene → D: propyne → E: acetone → F: propane → G: ? → H: ?

Wait, if F is propane and can't react with nitrous acid, this sequence is impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in E and F.

Another possibility: Maybe E is propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO). So after D (propyne) is treated with something to form E as aldehyde. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F as propane. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is propyl chloride. But I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe E is 1-propanol. Then, F could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction after E is different. Let me think about the reactions again.

Wait, when propyne (HC≡CCH3) is treated with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and another acid, maybe it's a hydration to form propylene oxide? No, that's more for epoxidation, which usually requires peracids.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation. But propyne would add HCl to form CH2Cl-C≡CH. Then, E would be CH2Cl-C≡CH. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe it's a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I might not get all the steps right and focus on the options. Let's see.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3, implying H is a phenol. But if H is CH3-C≡C-OH (from earlier), it's an alkyne alcohol, not a phenol. So option B would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if H is a phenol, then option B is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the last step. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

If G is a diazonium salt, and H is phenol, then perhaps in the reaction, the diazonium group is replaced by OH. But that would require the amine to be aromatic. For example, aniline (benzenamine) would form a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would give phenol. So if F is aniline, then G is the diazonium salt, and H is phenol. Thus, option B would be correct because phenol gives a yellow color with FeCl3.

But how would F be aniline? Let's see.

If E is benzene, then F could be aniline. But how would E become benzene? Let's retrace.

Wait, E again. D is propyne, which upon reaction with two strong acids could form benzene? Unlikely. So perhaps E is benzaldehyde, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off track. Maybe the reaction sequence is different. For example, perhaps the initial bromination is not addition but substitution. If A is cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4 would give bromocyclopropane. Then, elimination would form something else. But this is getting too speculative.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps the incorrect statement is option B, because H is not a phenol, hence doesn't give a yellow color with FeCl3.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A, identified as propene (C3H6). Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (compound B). Reaction of B with alcoholic KOH leads to elimination of HBr, regenerating propene (compound C). Passing propene through a red-hot iron tube dehydrogenates it to form propyne (compound D). 

When propyne reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, hydration occurs to form acetone (compound E). Treatment of acetone with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid reduces it via the Clemmensen reduction to propane (compound F). Propane, however, does not react with nitrous acid, creating a conflict in the sequence. Assuming the reaction sequence is correct, the subsequent steps involve F reacting with nitrous acid to form G, and G reacting with sodium hydroxide to form H.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this is incorrect, as propane is not used for dye synthesis. However, if F were a different compound (e.g., aniline), this could be correct.  
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This implies H is a phenol. However, based on the reaction sequence, H is unlikely to be phenol, as no aromatic ring is introduced in the steps.  
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. Propyne (CH3-C≡CH) has two distinct sets of protons: the CH3 group and the terminal H, both appearing as singlets in the NMR spectrum. This is correct.  
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. Propene (C) is a flammable gas, making this correct.

The incorrect statement is **Option B**, as H is not a phenol and does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride. 

Answer: B
