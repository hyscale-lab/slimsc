Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to the area of their event horizon. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3), where A is the area of the event horizon, right? But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the constants. Let me think.

The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy, so I should probably start by finding the radius of the event horizon first.

Oh wait, the event horizon's radius R is related to the Schwarzschild radius, which is R = 2GM/c². But for the purpose of finding the area, maybe I can find R using the angular size.

Angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the object (R) to the distance (d). So θ ≈ R/d. Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

Right, to convert degrees to radians, the formula is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17 * 3.1416)/(180). Let me calculate that. 3.1416/180 is about 0.0174533, so 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ R/d. Therefore, R = θ_rad * d. Wait, but d is in parsecs. I need to convert that to meters because all the other units (like R) should be in meters for the entropy formula.

One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d = (1.74533e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m). Let me compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = approximately (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, 0.086*1.745 is about 0.15, so total around 5.385. So 5.385e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.4e7 meters.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.74533 * 3.086) * 1e(26-19) = (5.385) * 1e7 = 5.385e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.385e7 m.

Now the area A of the event horizon is 4π R². Let me compute R squared: (5.385e7)^2 = (5.385)^2 * 1e14 = approximately 29.0 *1e14 = 2.9e15 m².

So A = 4 * π * 2.9e15 = 4 * 3.1416 * 2.9e15 ≈ 12.566 * 2.9e15 ≈ 36.44e15 m². Or about 3.644e16 m².

Now, the entropy S is (k * A) / (4ħ c^3). Let me recall the constants:

k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So let's plug them in:

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3.644e16 m²) / (4 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (3e8 m/s)^3 )

Let me compute denominator first: 4 * ħ * c³.

c³ = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So denominator: 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25) = 4 * (2.847e-9) = 1.1388e-8.

So denominator is 1.1388e-8 J·s * m³/s³. Wait, let me check the units. J is kg·m²/s². So denominator is (kg·m²/s²·s) * m³/s³) → kg·m^5/s^5.

The numerator is J/K * m². J is kg·m²/s², so numerator is kg·m²/s² * m² / K = kg·m^4/s² K.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

So numerator is 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = (1.38 *3.644) e(-23+16) = 5.056e-7.

So S = (5.056e-7) / (1.1388e-8) ) ≈ (5.056 / 1.1388) * 1e1 ≈ approximately 4.436 * 10 = 44.36.

Wait, that can't be right because 44 is way too small; the options are all around 1e59 or 1e65. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's recompute:

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = 1.38 * 3.644 = approximately 5.056, and exponents: 1e-23 * 1e16 = 1e-7. So 5.056e-7 J·m²/(K·s·m³/s³) ? Hmm, perhaps I need to recompute the denominator correctly.

Wait, let me re-express the formula properly:

S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3)

k=1.38e-23 J/K

A=3.644e16 m²

So:

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = 1.38 * 3.644 = ~5.056, exponents: -23 +16 = -7 → 5.056e-7 J·m²/K.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * c^3.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

Multiply all: 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25.

Calculate 4 * 1.05457e-34 = 4.218e-34.

Multiply by 2.7e25: 4.218e-34 * 2.7e25 = (4.218 * 2.7) * 1e-9 ≈ 11.39e-9 = 1.139e-8.

So denominator is 1.139e-8 J·s * m³/s³ → J·m³/s².

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So denominator has units kg·m²/s² * m³/s² → kg·m^5/s^4.

Wait, perhaps I should just focus on the numerical calculation.

So S = (5.056e-7) / (1.139e-8) = (5.056 / 1.139) * 1e( -7 +8 ) = approx 4.436 * 10^1 = ~44.36.

That can't be right because the answer options are way larger. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Did I mix up R and θ? Or perhaps the formula for entropy is different?

Wait, wait. Wait a second, the entropy formula is S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), or something involving G, the gravitational constant. Oh! Wait, I think I forgot the gravitational constant G in the entropy formula.

Let me check: The correct formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k A )/(4 ħ G) ) * c^4? Or perhaps more accurately, S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G) )? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the area term is A = 16 π (G M c^-2)^2. So the entropy formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I need to include G in the denominator.

Let me think again. The correct formula is S = (k A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(something?))... Alternatively, I might have mixed up the formula.

Wait, another approach: The event horizon area is A = 16 π (G M / c² )². So M = (R_s c² )/(2 G ), where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (R = 2 G M / c² → M = R c²/(2 G )).

The formula for entropy is S = (A k c^3 )/(4 ħ G). So plugging A into the formula:

S = (16 π (G M / c² )²) * k c^3 / (4 ħ G )

Simplify:

S = (16 π G² M² / c^4 ) * k c^3 / (4 ħ G )

Simplify that:

16/4 =4.
G² / G = G.
c^3 / c^4 = 1/c.

So:

S = (4 π G M² k )/( ħ c )

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to use the original approach but correct the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should get the correct expression. Let me think, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:

S = (A k c^3 )/(4 ħ G ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Ah, yes, that's the correct formula. So I missed the c^3 and G in the denominator. So my earlier mistake was not including G. I see that now.

So the formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G )

So let's plug the correct values into this formula.

So, A is 3.644e16 m².

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m^3/(kg·s²).

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k * c^3 * A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 * 3.644e16.

Compute each part:

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 * 2.7 = ~3.726 → 3.726e2.

Multiply by 3.644e16: 3.726e2 * 3.644e16 = (3.726 *3.644 )e(2+16) → approx (13.58) *1e18 → 1.358e19.

So numerator is 1.358e19 J·m²/s^3.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11.

Compute 4 * 1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 * 6.6743e-11 ≈ (4.21828 *6.6743) e(-34-11) → 28.17e-45 → 2.817e-44.

So denominator is 2.817e-44 J·s·m^3/(kg·s²) ) → Wait, the units are getting complicated here, but perhaps I should focus on the numerical value.

So the entropy S = numerator / denominator = 1.358e19 / 2.817e-44 = (1.358 /2.817) * 1e(19 +44) → 0.4816 * 1e63 → approx 4.816e62 J/K.

So the entropy is about 1e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any errors.

Wait, earlier I found A = 3.644e16 m².

Compute numerator: k c^3 A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 * 3.644e16.

Calculating step by step:

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3:

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 =2.7e25.

1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 =3.726 → 3.726e2.

Now multiply by A (3.644e16):

3.726e2 * 3.644e16 = (3.726 *3.644) *1e18.

3.726 *3.644: let's compute that.

3 *3.644=10.932, 0.726 *3.644 ≈2.647. So total is about 13.579.

So 13.579e18 → 1.3579e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

4 *1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.21828 *6.6743) e(-34-11).

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.166.

So 28.166e-45 → 2.8166e-44.

So S = 1.3579e19 / 2.8166e-44 = (1.3579 /2.8166) * 1e(19 +44).

1.3579 /2.8166 ≈ ~0.4819.

So 0.4819e63 = 4.819e62 J/K.

Which is roughly 1e62 J/K, so the order of magnitude is 10^62. Looking at the options, option A is 10^62 J/K.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the entropy of the black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where:
- \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( A \) is the area of the event horizon,
- \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (reduced Planck constant),
- \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2) \) (gravitational constant).

### Step 1: Calculate the radius \( R \) of the event horizon
The angular size \( \theta \) is related to the radius \( R \) and distance \( d \) by:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{R}{d}
\]

Given \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \) and \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), we first convert \( \theta \) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \times \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

Next, convert \( d \) to meters:

\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, calculate \( R \):

\[
R = \theta_{\text{rad}} \times d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \times (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.385 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area \( A \) of the event horizon
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

First, calculate \( R^2 \):

\[
R^2 = (5.385 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 2.90 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Now, calculate \( A \):

\[
A = 4 \pi (2.90 \times 10^{15}) \approx 4 \times 3.1416 \times 2.90 \times 10^{15} \approx 3.644 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \( S \)
Substitute \( A = 3.644 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator \( k c^3 A \):

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 \times (3.644 \times 10^{16}).
\]

Compute \( c^3 \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3.
\]

Now, compute \( k c^3 A \):

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \times (3.644 \times 10^{16}) \approx 1.358 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator \( 4 \hbar G \):

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \times (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.817 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{J·s·m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2).
\]

Finally, calculate \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1.358 \times 10^{19}}{2.817 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.819 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \( 4.819 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), so the order of magnitude is \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**A) \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \)**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to the area of their event horizon. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3), where A is the area of the event horizon, right? But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the constants. Let me think.

The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy, so I should probably start by finding the radius of the event horizon first.

Oh wait, the event horizon's radius R is related to the Schwarzschild radius, which is R = 2GM/c². But for the purpose of finding the area, maybe I can find R using the angular size.

Angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the object (R) to the distance (d). So θ ≈ R/d. Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

Right, to convert degrees to radians, the formula is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17 * 3.1416)/(180). Let me calculate that. 3.1416/180 is about 0.0174533, so 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ R/d. Therefore, R = θ_rad * d. Wait, but d is in parsecs. I need to convert that to meters because all the other units (like R) should be in meters for the entropy formula.

One parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d = (1.74533e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m). Let me compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = approximately (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, 0.086*1.745 is about 0.15, so total around 5.385. So 5.385e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.4e7 meters.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.74533 * 3.086) * 1e(26-19) = (5.385) * 1e7 = 5.385e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.385e7 m.

Now the area A of the event horizon is 4π R². Let me compute R squared: (5.385e7)^2 = (5.385)^2 * 1e14 = approximately 29.0 *1e14 = 2.9e15 m².

So A = 4 * π * 2.9e15 = 4 * 3.1416 * 2.9e15 ≈ 12.566 * 2.9e15 ≈ 36.44e15 m². Or about 3.644e16 m².

Now, the entropy S is (k * A) / (4ħ c^3). Let me recall the constants:

k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So let's plug them in:

S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3.644e16 m²) / (4 * 1.0545718e-34 J·s * (3e8 m/s)^3 )

Let me compute denominator first: 4 * ħ * c³.

c³ = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So denominator: 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25) = 4 * (2.847e-9) = 1.1388e-8.

So denominator is 1.1388e-8 J·s * m³/s³. Wait, let me check the units. J is kg·m²/s². So denominator is (kg·m²/s²·s) * m³/s³) → kg·m^5/s^5.

The numerator is J/K * m². J is kg·m²/s², so numerator is kg·m²/s² * m² / K = kg·m^4/s² K.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the calculation.

So numerator is 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = (1.38 *3.644) e(-23+16) = 5.056e-7.

So S = (5.056e-7) / (1.1388e-8) ) ≈ (5.056 / 1.1388) * 1e1 ≈ approximately 4.436 * 10 = 44.36.

Wait, that can't be right because 44 is way too small; the options are all around 1e59 or 1e65. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's recompute:

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = 1.38 * 3.644 = approximately 5.056, and exponents: 1e-23 * 1e16 = 1e-7. So 5.056e-7 J·m²/(K·s·m³/s³) ? Hmm, perhaps I need to recompute the denominator correctly.

Wait, let me re-express the formula properly:

S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3)

k=1.38e-23 J/K

A=3.644e16 m²

So:

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.644e16 = 1.38 * 3.644 = ~5.056, exponents: -23 +16 = -7 → 5.056e-7 J·m²/K.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * c^3.

ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

Multiply all: 4 * 1.05457e-34 * 2.7e25.

Calculate 4 * 1.05457e-34 = 4.218e-34.

Multiply by 2.7e25: 4.218e-34 * 2.7e25 = (4.218 * 2.7) * 1e-9 ≈ 11.39e-9 = 1.139e-8.

So denominator is 1.139e-8 J·s * m³/s³ → J·m³/s².

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So denominator has units kg·m²/s² * m³/s² → kg·m^5/s^4.

Wait, perhaps I should just focus on the numerical calculation.

So S = (5.056e-7) / (1.139e-8) = (5.056 / 1.139) * 1e( -7 +8 ) = approx 4.436 * 10^1 = ~44.36.

That can't be right because the answer options are way larger. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Did I mix up R and θ? Or perhaps the formula for entropy is different?

Wait, wait. Wait a second, the entropy formula is S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), or something involving G, the gravitational constant. Oh! Wait, I think I forgot the gravitational constant G in the entropy formula.

Let me check: The correct formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k A )/(4 ħ G) ) * c^4? Or perhaps more accurately, S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G) )? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the area term is A = 16 π (G M c^-2)^2. So the entropy formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G). Hmm, perhaps I need to include G in the denominator.

Let me think again. The correct formula is S = (k A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (1/(something?))... Alternatively, I might have mixed up the formula.

Wait, another approach: The event horizon area is A = 16 π (G M / c² )². So M = (R_s c² )/(2 G ), where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius (R = 2 G M / c² → M = R c²/(2 G )).

The formula for entropy is S = (A k c^3 )/(4 ħ G). So plugging A into the formula:

S = (16 π (G M / c² )²) * k c^3 / (4 ħ G )

Simplify:

S = (16 π G² M² / c^4 ) * k c^3 / (4 ħ G )

Simplify that:

16/4 =4.
G² / G = G.
c^3 / c^4 = 1/c.

So:

S = (4 π G M² k )/( ħ c )

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to use the original approach but correct the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should get the correct expression. Let me think, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:

S = (A k c^3 )/(4 ħ G ), where A is the area of the event horizon.

Ah, yes, that's the correct formula. So I missed the c^3 and G in the denominator. So my earlier mistake was not including G. I see that now.

So the formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G )

So let's plug the correct values into this formula.

So, A is 3.644e16 m².

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

c = 3e8 m/s.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m^3/(kg·s²).

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: k * c^3 * A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 * 3.644e16.

Compute each part:

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25.

So 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 * 2.7 = ~3.726 → 3.726e2.

Multiply by 3.644e16: 3.726e2 * 3.644e16 = (3.726 *3.644 )e(2+16) → approx (13.58) *1e18 → 1.358e19.

So numerator is 1.358e19 J·m²/s^3.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 * 1.05457e-34 * 6.6743e-11.

Compute 4 * 1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 * 6.6743e-11 ≈ (4.21828 *6.6743) e(-34-11) → 28.17e-45 → 2.817e-44.

So denominator is 2.817e-44 J·s·m^3/(kg·s²) ) → Wait, the units are getting complicated here, but perhaps I should focus on the numerical value.

So the entropy S = numerator / denominator = 1.358e19 / 2.817e-44 = (1.358 /2.817) * 1e(19 +44) → 0.4816 * 1e63 → approx 4.816e62 J/K.

So the entropy is about 1e62 J/K. Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any errors.

Wait, earlier I found A = 3.644e16 m².

Compute numerator: k c^3 A = 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3 * 3.644e16.

Calculating step by step:

1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3:

(3e8)^3 = 27e24 =2.7e25.

1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 =3.726 → 3.726e2.

Now multiply by A (3.644e16):

3.726e2 * 3.644e16 = (3.726 *3.644) *1e18.

3.726 *3.644: let's compute that.

3 *3.644=10.932, 0.726 *3.644 ≈2.647. So total is about 13.579.

So 13.579e18 → 1.3579e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

4 *1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.21828 *6.6743) e(-34-11).

4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.166.

So 28.166e-45 → 2.8166e-44.

So S = 1.3579e19 / 2.8166e-44 = (1.3579 /2.8166) * 1e(19 +44).

1.3579 /2.8166 ≈ ~0.4819.

So 0.4819e63 = 4.819e62 J/K.

Which is roughly 1e62 J/K, so the order of magnitude is 10^62. Looking at the options, option A is 10^62 J/K.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the entropy of the black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where:
- \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) (Boltzmann constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( A \) is the area of the event horizon,
- \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (reduced Planck constant),
- \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2) \) (gravitational constant).

### Step 1: Calculate the radius \( R \) of the event horizon
The angular size \( \theta \) is related to the radius \( R \) and distance \( d \) by:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{R}{d}
\]

Given \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \) and \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \), we first convert \( \theta \) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \times \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

Next, convert \( d \) to meters:

\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, calculate \( R \):

\[
R = \theta_{\text{rad}} \times d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \times (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.385 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area \( A \) of the event horizon
The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

First, calculate \( R^2 \):

\[
R^2 = (5.385 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 2.90 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Now, calculate \( A \):

\[
A = 4 \pi (2.90 \times 10^{15}) \approx 4 \times 3.1416 \times 2.90 \times 10^{15} \approx 3.644 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy \( S \)
Substitute \( A = 3.644 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator \( k c^3 A \):

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (3 \times 10^8)^3 \times (3.644 \times 10^{16}).
\]

Compute \( c^3 \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3.
\]

Now, compute \( k c^3 A \):

\[
k c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \times (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \times (3.644 \times 10^{16}) \approx 1.358 \times 10^{19} \, \text{J·m}^2/\text{s}^3.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator \( 4 \hbar G \):

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \times (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.817 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{J·s·m}^3/(\text{kg·s}^2).
\]

Finally, calculate \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1.358 \times 10^{19}}{2.817 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.819 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \( 4.819 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), so the order of magnitude is \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**A) \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \)**.
