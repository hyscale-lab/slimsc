Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1. But wait, the wave function given here seems a bit odd. It has a real part and an imaginary part. Oh wait, no, the wave function is complex, so the correct probability density is the modulus squared, which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let's write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + (-0.5i). The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) + 0.5i. So the product ψψ* is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you multiply (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but wait, no, wait. Let me think. (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b². Because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² - (bi)^2 = a² - (-b²) = a² + b². So in this case, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and b is 0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that would make the probability density |ψ|² = [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

Now, since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, the wave function isn't zero, but the probability of finding the particle outside x=1 and x=3 is zero. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x = -infinity to 1 must be zero, and same from 3 to +infinity. That would imply that |ψ(x)|² is zero outside 1 to 3, which suggests that the wave function is zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that can't be zero except if a/sqrt(1+x) is zero, which isn't possible unless a is zero, which can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The wave function is given in the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but that's not what the question says. The question says that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is given by this expression. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1.

So |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25, as I thought earlier. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [(a²)/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2, because (a + b i)(a - b i) = a² + b², right? So a is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5, so [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Now, integrating this from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

So let's set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

a² * Integral from 1 to 3 of 1/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. Let's calculate ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's compute that.

√0.7213 ≈ 0.849. So approximately 0.85.

Wait, the options are 1.1, 0.85, 0.35, 0.6. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that right? Let me double-check.

Let me re-express the integral calculations.

Integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is indeed ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So that part is correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct.

So equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849.

So the correct value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another way to think: The wave function's modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Then integrating from 1 to 3.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) for \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and the probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since all particles are found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Substituting these results into the equation:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Because (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² - (bi)^2 = a² - (-b²) = a² + b². So in this case, a is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and b is 0.5. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that would make the probability density |ψ|² = [ (a²)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

Now, since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, the wave function isn't zero, but the probability of finding the particle outside x=1 and x=3 is zero.

So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Now, integrating this from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

So let's set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts:

a² * Integral from 1 to 3 of 1/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that. Let's calculate ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of 0.7213. Let's compute that.

√0.7213 ≈ 0.849. So approximately 0.85.

Wait, the options are 1.1, 0.85, 0.35, 0.6. So option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that right? Let me double-check.

Let me re-express the integral calculations.

Integral of 1/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is indeed ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). So that part is correct.

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5. Correct.

So equation: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5)/ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ 0.849.

So the correct value of a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another way to think: The wave function's modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. Then integrating from 1 to 3.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) for \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), and the probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since all particles are found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
   \]

Substituting these results into the equation:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
