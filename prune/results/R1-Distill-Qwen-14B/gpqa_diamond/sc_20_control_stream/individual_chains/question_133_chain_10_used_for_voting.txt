Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The problem says there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, I think. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters.

Wait, so first I need to find out how many moles of each of these compounds are present. Because when they dissolve, they'll dissociate into ions. Then, I can figure out the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, and from that, maybe use some equilibrium expressions to find PO4^3-.

Let me start with the moles. For KH2PO4: 1.00 g divided by 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 / 136.09 is approximately 0.007338 mol. So about 0.007338 moles of KH2PO4.

Then for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1 divided by 178 is roughly 0.005618 mol. So about 0.005618 moles of that.

Now, when these salts dissolve, they dissociate. Let's think about each:

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ + H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. Wait, but in solution, the water is just the solvent, so the important ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we'll have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from the sodium hydrogen phosphate.

The concentrations of these ions will affect the speciation of phosphate in solution. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, it can donate three protons, but the relevant ones here are the first and second deprotonations.

The phosphate species in solution will be H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- based on pH. The problem gives us the Ka values: Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, but how does this help? Well, the solution is a buffer because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Specifically, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (the first dissociation), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be useful here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa for the second dissociation is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208. Hmm, wait, wait, no: wait, H2PO4^- is the acid, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH of the solution would be around pKa2 of H2PO4^- because we have both the acid and its conjugate base in solution.

So first, calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 L.

Moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007338 mol.
Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005618 mol.

Wait, but the solution volume is 0.2 L, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 / 0.2 = 0.03669 M.
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
pH = pKa2 + log ([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

So pKa2 is the pKa of the second dissociation, which is log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that: log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 0.792 - 8 = -7.208. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 6.2e-8. So pKa is about 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log (0.02809 / 0.03669)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02809 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is about -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Because the phosphate can dissociate further. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is about 11.74.

At pH 7.09, which is lower than pKa3, so the concentration of PO4^3- will be low.

The expression for this is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Wait, but [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.09, so [H+] is 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So let's plug the numbers.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.23e-8)

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 ≈ 5.056e-14.

Denominator: 8.23e-8.

So 5.056e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approx (5.056 / 8.23) * 1e-6.

5.056 /8.23 ≈ 0.614.

So 0.614e-6 = 6.14e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close.

Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate the ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch more precisely.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 / 0.2 = 0.03669 M.

Ratio: 0.02809 / 0.03669 = let me compute that.

0.02809 ÷ 0.03669 ≈ 0.766.

Taking log(0.766). Let me compute it more accurately.

Log(0.766) → since 10^−0.114 ≈ 0.775, so perhaps it's about -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 -0.114 ≈7.094.

Then [H+] is 10^-7.094. Let me compute that.

7.094 is 7 + 0.094, so 10^0.094 ≈ 1.24 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.258, so 0.094 is a bit less, say 1.23).

So [H+]≈ 1.23e-7 M.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.23e-8, but that must be incorrect. Wait, no, if pH is 7.094, then [H+] is 10^-7.094, which is about 8.23e-8?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, 10^-7 is 1e-7, which is 0.1e-6.

At pH 7.094, the [H+] is 10^-7.094.

Using a calculator, 10^0.094 is approximately 1.238. So 10^-7.094 = (10^-7) * (10^-0.094) = 1e-7 / 1.238 ≈ 8.076e-8.

Ah, so [H+] ≈8.076e-8 M.

So going back to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M.

So numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = let me compute that.

1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator: 8.076e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (5.0562e-14) / (8.076e-8) ) = (5.0562 / 8.076) * 1e-6.

5.0562 ÷8.076 ≈ ~0.626.

So 0.626e-6 = 6.26e-7 M.

Wait, that's approximately 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is really close.

But wait, let me think again. Did I consider all the ions correctly?

Wait, another approach: the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

In such a buffer, the concentrations of these two ions are determined by the amounts from the salts.

But when we add both, is there any precipitation or reaction between them? Well, KH2PO4 is a weak acid, and Na2HPO4 is the conjugate base, so they form a buffer.

In this case, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.03669 M.

Now, the PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

The equation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

So the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the second and third dissociations.

Wait, but wait: HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

But in this case, the pH is around 7.09, which is below the pKa3. So the concentration of PO4^3- is minimal.

So the approach I took earlier should be correct.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Let me recalculate the Henderson-Hasselbalch.

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → exact calculation:

Ka2 =6.2e-8 → pKa2 =-log(6.2e-8).

log(6.2)=0.7923 → 0.7923 -8 =-7.2077? Wait, wait no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka).

So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.2079.

Now, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03669.

Compute that ratio: 0.02809 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.7662.

log(0.7662) = ln(0.7662)/ln(10) → ln(0.7662) ≈-0.267. So -0.267/2.3026 ≈-0.116.

So pH =7.2079 - 0.116 ≈7.0919.

So pH ≈7.0919.

[H+] = 10^-7.0919 ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

Now, using Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M.

[H+] =8.08e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.08e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 = 5.0562e-14.

Denominator:8.08e-8.

So 5.0562e-14 /8.08e-8 = (5.0562 /8.08) * 1e-6.

5.0562 ÷8.08 ≈ 0.626.

So 0.626e-6 =6.26e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check if I considered all the dissociations correctly.

Wait, another thing: the total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in solution, H3PO4 is negligible because it's a weak acid and the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa1 (≈2.12; since pKa1 is -log(7.5e-3)= ~2.12). So H3PO4 is mostly deprotonated to H2PO4^-.

So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the concentration based on the buffer solution and the third dissociation.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the buffer solution is at a certain pH, which affects the distribution of phosphate species.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations using the given Ka values and the pH.

But I think my approach was correct. So the answer should be around 6.26e-7, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the dissociation of the given salts and using the equilibrium constants provided.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Dissociates into \( \text{K}^+ + \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \).  
  Contribution to \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] \): \( 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Dissociates into \( 2\text{Na}^+ + \text{HPO}_4^{2-} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
  Contribution to \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] \): \( 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in solution
The total volume of the solution is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2000 \, \text{L} \).

- \( [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007338 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} = 0.03669 \, \text{M} \).  
- \( [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.2000 \, \text{L}} = 0.02809 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The solution is a buffer between \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base). The relevant \( \text{pKa} \) is \( \text{pKa}_2 \), where:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right).
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02809}{0.03669} \right).
\]

Calculate the ratio:  
\[
\frac{0.02809}{0.03669} \approx 0.766.
\]

\[
\log(0.766) \approx -0.114.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \) using \( \text{Ka}_3 \)
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{PO}_4^{3-} + \text{H}^+.
\]

The equilibrium constant is \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \), and \( \text{pKa}_3 = -\log(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.74 \).

At \( \text{pH} = 7.094 \), the concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) is:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]

Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]

Calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809) \approx 5.056 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Divide by the denominator:  
\[
\frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
