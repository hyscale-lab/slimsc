Okay, so I have this problem where an electron is in a spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the spin state of an electron is a two-component vector, like a spinor. In this case, the state is given as (3i, 4), which I think means the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So the state vector χ is [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation, right? So the expectation value of S_y would be χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix. Oh wait, σ_y is given here as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So I need to compute χ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by χ.

Let me write out the steps. First, χ is a column vector, so χ† would be a row vector [3i, 4] conjugated. Wait, wait—the components are 3i and 4. So the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 stays 4. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Next, I multiply χ† by σ_y. So that's a 1x2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute each element:

The first element would be ( -3i * 0 ) + ( 4 * i ), which is 4i. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The matrix multiplication would be:

χ† σ_y = [ -3i , 4 ] multiplied by σ_y.

So each element in the resulting row vector is the sum of products of the first row of χ† and each column of σ_y.

So let's compute each element:

First element: (-3i)*(0) + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*(0) = (3i^2) + 0. But i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now I need to multiply this by χ. So that's [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

Wait, no—matrix multiplication is row times column. So it's (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Let's compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Then, (-3)*4 = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, that's the product of χ† σ_y χ? So the expectation value is -24 times ħ/2? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues plus or minus ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So σ_y multiplied by ħ/2 gives the actual operator.

Wait, no, wait. The operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So when we compute the expectation value, it's (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So the expectation value of σ_y would be (χ† σ_y χ) which I calculated as -24. Then S_y's expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, wait, wait. That can't be right. Because the options don't have -12 ħ; looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me go back step by step.

So χ is [3i; 4]. χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Then χ† σ_y is [ (-3i)*0 + 4*i, (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 ].

Wait, let me recompute that. The σ_y matrix is:

First row: 0, -i

Second row: i, 0.

Wait, no, the σ_y matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0.

So when I multiply χ† (which is [a, b]) by σ_y, the resulting row vector is [ a*0 + b*i , a*(-i) + b*0 ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication:

χ† is [a, b], σ_y is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So the product χ† σ_y is [ a*0 + b*i , a*(-i) + b*0 ].

So a is -3i, b is 4.

So first element: (-3i)*0 +4*i = 4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) = 3*(-1) = -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Then, now multiply this by χ, which is [3i; 4].

So [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

So 4i *3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value of σ_y is -24. Then S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option A: -12 ħ/25. So where did I go wrong?

Wait another thought: perhaps the way the spinor is normalized. Because the expectation value requires the state to be normalized. Oh right, I forgot to normalize the state. Because the state might not be normalized. So I need to compute the expectation value as (χ† σ_y χ) / (χ† χ) multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value of S_y is (⟨χ| σ_y |χ⟩) (ħ/2) divided by the norm squared?

Wait, the expectation value is (⟨χ| σ_y |χ⟩) multiplied by ħ/2, and then if the state is normalized, it's just that. But if the state is not normalized, we have to divide by the inner product ⟨χ|χ⟩ to get the normalized expectation value.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩, but only if χ is normalized. If not, the expectation value is (⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩) * (ħ/2) divided by ⟨χ | χ⟩.

Wait, actually, the expectation value for an operator O is ⟨O⟩ = (⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩) / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, assuming ψ is not normalized. So I think I made a mistake in not normalizing the state.

So first, I should compute the norm of χ. The norm squared is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = (9*(-i^2)) +16. Wait, i^2 is -1, so 9*(-(-1))=9*1=9, plus 16, so 25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5.

So the normalized state is χ_normalized = χ / 5.

So when computing ⟨σ_y⟩, it's (⟨χ| σ_y |χ⟩ ) / (⟨χ|χ⟩).

Which is (-24) /25.

So the expectation value of S_y would be (ħ/2) * (-24/25) ) = (-12 ħ) /25.

Ah, that makes sense. So the answer would be option A: -12 hbar/25.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

χ is [3i;4], so χ† is [ -3i,4 ].

Compute χ† σ_y χ:

σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

So σ_y multiplied by χ is:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, χ† multiplied by this: [ -3i,4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

So (-3i)*(-4i) +4*(-3) = (12 i^2) + (-12).

i^2 is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

-12 + (-12) = -24.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ is (-24)/(25) because the norm is 5, so 25.

So S_y expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator and Pauli Matrix**:  
   The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli y-matrix:  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle}{\langle \chi | \chi \rangle},
   \]  
   where \( \langle \chi | \chi \rangle \) ensures normalization of the state.

3. **Compute \( \langle \chi | \chi \rangle \)**:  
   The norm of the state \( \chi \) is:  
   \[
   \langle \chi | \chi \rangle = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9(-i^2) + 16 = 9(1) + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is \( \chi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\chi}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{\chi}{5} \).

4. **Compute \( \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle \)**:  
   First, calculate \( \sigma_y | \chi \rangle \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \cdot 3i + (-i) \cdot 4 \\ i \cdot 3i + 0 \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, compute \( \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle \):  
   \[
   \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Perform the multiplication:  
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

5. **Normalize and Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)**:  
   The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle}{\langle \chi | \chi \rangle} = \frac{-24}{25}.
   \]  
   Therefore, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:  
   **A) -12*hbar/25**.
