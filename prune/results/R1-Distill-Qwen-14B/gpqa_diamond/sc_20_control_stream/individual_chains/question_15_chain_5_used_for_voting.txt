Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two exoplanets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me try to break this down.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. So, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) squared over (a_planet squared), but wait, I think the actual formula is more about the relative size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. Or wait, is it (R_star / a_planet) squared? Or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet) over a_planet, but since planets are much smaller than stars, it's approximately R_star/a_planet. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet)^2.

Wait, another thought: the exact formula for transit probability is P_transit = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. But I'm not entirely sure if the exact formula is that or if it's squared. Let me think again. I think the probability is higher when the star is larger or the planet's orbital distance is smaller. Because if the planet is closer, the disk is more likely to be aligned edge-on.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else? Or is it (R_star / a_planet) squared? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_star / a_planet). Because the area of the star is πR_star², and the area of the planet's orbital disk is πa_planet². So the probability would be (R_star / a_planet)². Because the chance of the planet passing in front is proportional to the area ratio. Oh, okay, so P_transit is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Got it.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. So larger R_star and smaller a_planet both increase the probability.

In this problem, we have two planets: 1 and 2.

Let me note down the given data:

- Both have same mass. But I don't think mass affects transit probability, which depends on size and orbital parameters.

- Orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3 divided by M_star. The exact formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a^3. Since planet masses are much smaller than stars, M_star ≈ M_star.

So, for each planet, P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G M_star). So, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4π²).

So, a is proportional to (M_star P²)^(1/3).

Let me compute a for each planet.

But wait, the question says that both planets have the same mass. Oh, but the host stars are different. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, but the host stars have the same radii as the question states: both host stars have same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same R.

So R1 = R2.

So P1 is shorter, so P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

For each planet, a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (something). So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

So a1 proportional to (M1 * P1^2)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3).

But wait, I think I should express a1 in terms of a2.

Wait, let's write the ratio of a1 to a2.

a1/a2 = [(M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2)]^(1/3)

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

[(2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )]^(1/3)

Simplify the P terms: (P2^2 / 9) / P2^2 = 1/9.

So inside the brackets: 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) / (3^2)^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3).

Which can be written as (2/3^2)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that numerically. 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is around 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but wait, a1 is the semi-major axis for planet 1, which has a shorter period. So that makes sense because closer in, shorter period.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63.

Now, transit probability is (R_star/a)^2.

R1 = R2, as given. So P1's transit prob is (R/(a1))^2, and P2's is (R/(a2))^2.

So P1's probability is (R/(0.63 a2))^2 = (1/(0.63)^2) * (R/a2)^2.

Since P2's probability is (R/a2)^2.

So the ratio P1 / P2 = (1/(0.63)^2) = 1/(0.3969) ≈ 2.52.

Wait, that would mean P1 is about 2.52 times more probable than P2. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but that's if a1 is smaller, so R/a is larger, leading to higher probability. So yes, P1 has higher probability.

Wait, but let me compute the exact ratio more carefully.

Compute (a1 / a2) = (2/(9))^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

But to compute (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So (R/a1)/(R/a2) = (a2/a1) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So the transit probability for planet 1 is (R/a1)^2 = [ (R/a2) * (a2/a1) ]^2 = (R/a2)^2 * (a2/a1)^2.

So P1 = P2 * (a2/a1)^2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

What's a2/a1?

a2/a1 = [ ( (M2 P2^2 ) ) / ( (M1 P1^2) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, M1=2M2, P1 = P2/3.

So M1 = 2 M2, P1^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So a2/a1 = [ ( M2 P2^2 ) / ( 2 M2 * (P2^2)/9 ) ) ]^(1/3) = [ (1) / (2/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 = 2.72.

So Planet_1 has about 2.72 times higher probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

But let me make sure.

Wait, a1 is smaller than a2 because it's closer. So (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So transit probability for P1 is larger.

Wait, the transit probability is (R/a)^2. So yes, P1 has higher probability.

So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3).

Compute 9/2: 4.5. 4.5^(2/3).

What's 4.5^(1/3) is approximately 1.65, so squared is about 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.7 times more probable than P2, so the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, Option D says Planet_1 is preferred with ~2.7 times higher probability. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}\right)^2
\]

Here, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a_{\text{planet}}\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are hosted by stars with the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)), the transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the semi-major axes (\(a_1\) and \(a_2\)).

### Step 1: Relating orbital periods and semi-major axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period and the mass of the host star:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.63
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.63a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}\right)^2\). Since \(R_1 = R_2\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

From Step 1, \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65\). Squaring this:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(1.65\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a probability 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.

Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two exoplanets, and I need to figure out which one has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me try to break this down.

Oh wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_star / a_planet). Because the area of the star is πR_star², and the area of the planet's orbital disk is πa_planet². So the probability would be (R_star / a_planet)². Because the chance of the planet passing in front is proportional to the area ratio. Oh, okay, so P_transit is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Got it.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet)^2. So larger R_star and smaller a_planet both increase the probability.

In this problem, we have two planets: 1 and 2.

Let me note down the given data:

- Both have same mass. But I don't think mass affects transit probability, which depends on size and orbital parameters.

- Orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that P^2 is proportional to a^3 divided by M_star. The exact formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a^3. Since planet masses are much smaller than stars, M_star ≈ M_star.

So, for each planet, P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G M_star). So, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4π²).

So, a is proportional to (M_star P²)^(1/3).

Let me compute a for each planet.

But wait, the question says that both planets have the same mass. Oh, but the host stars are different. Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

Wait, but the host stars have the same radii as the question states: both host stars have same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same R.

So R1 = R2.

So P1 is shorter, so P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

For each planet, a^3 = (G M_star P^2) / (something). So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3).

So a1 proportional to (M1 * P1^2)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3).

But wait, I think I should express a1 in terms of a2.

Wait, let's write the ratio of a1 to a2.

a1/a2 = [(M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2)]^(1/3)

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

[(2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2^2 )]^(1/3)

Simplify the P terms: (P2^2 / 9) / P2^2 = 1/9.

So inside the brackets: 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) / (3^2)^(1/3) ) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3).

Which can be written as (2/3^2)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that numerically. 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root is around 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, but wait, a1 is the semi-major axis for planet 1, which has a shorter period. So that makes sense because closer in, shorter period.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63.

Now, transit probability is (R_star/a)^2.

R1 = R2, as given. So P1's transit prob is (R/(a1))^2, and P2's is (R/(a2))^2.

So P1's probability is (R/(0.63 a2))^2 = (1/(0.63)^2) * (R/a2)^2.

Since P2's probability is (R/a2)^2.

So the ratio P1 / P2 = (1/(0.63)^2) = 1/(0.3969) ≈ 2.52.

Wait, that would mean P1 is about 2.52 times more probable than P2. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

Wait, but that's if a1 is smaller, so R/a is larger, leading to higher probability. So yes, P1 has higher probability.

Wait, but let me compute the exact ratio more carefully.

Compute (a1 / a2) = (2/(9))^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

But to compute (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So (R/a1)/(R/a2) = (a2/a1) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So the transit probability for planet 1 is (R/a1)^2 = [ (R/a2) * (a2/a1) ]^2 = (R/a2)^2 * (a2/a1)^2.

So P1 = P2 * (a2/a1)^2.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

What's a2/a1?

a2/a1 = [ ( (M2 P2^2 ) ) / ( (M1 P1^2) ) ]^(1/3) )

Wait, M1=2M2, P1 = P2/3.

So M1 = 2 M2, P1^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So a2/a1 = [ ( M2 P2^2 ) / ( 2 M2 * (P2^2)/9 ) ) ]^(1/3) = [ (1) / (2/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (9/2)^(1/3).

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1/P2 = 2.72.

So Planet_1 has about 2.72 times higher probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

But let me make sure.

Wait, a1 is smaller than a2 because it's closer. So (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2). So transit probability for P1 is larger.

Wait, the transit probability is (R/a)^2. So yes, P1 has higher probability.

So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3).

Compute 9/2: 4.5. 4.5^(2/3).

What's 4.5^(1/3) is approximately 1.65, so squared is about 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.7 times more probable than P2, so the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options, Option D says Planet_1 is preferred with ~2.7 times higher probability. So the correct answer should be D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}\right)^2
\]

Here, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a_{\text{planet}}\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are hosted by stars with the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)), the transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the semi-major axes (\(a_1\) and \(a_2\)).

### Step 1: Relating orbital periods and semi-major axes
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period and the mass of the host star:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.63
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.63a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Comparing transit probabilities
The transit probability is proportional to \(\left(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_{\text{planet}}}\right)^2\). Since \(R_1 = R_2\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

From Step 1, \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65\). Squaring this:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(1.65\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a probability 1.65 times higher.
- **Option D**: Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability.

### Final Answer
The researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.

**Answer: D**
