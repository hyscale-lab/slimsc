Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, what's a Schrödinger cat state? Oh right, it's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite amplitudes, creating a state that's macroscopically distinct. These are non-Gaussian states because they're not Gaussian distributions in phase space.

The non-Gaussianity here is measured using relative entropy. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, wait. So the non-Gaussianity (nG) is the relative entropy between the state and the reference Gaussian. If the state is already Gaussian, the entropy should be zero, right? Because they'd be the same.

But wait, is this state a Gaussian state? Well, the state here is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the nG shouldn't be zero. So option D is probably not the answer.

But wait, I should think more carefully. What is the reference Gaussian state tau here? Oh, I think the reference is usually the closest Gaussian state to rho. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps for this specific case, the state might be Gaussian, but I don't think so.

Wait, let me compute the state for the given parameters. phi is -pi/4, so let's compute cos(phi) and sin(phi). Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.707.

So the state becomes [0.707 |alpha> -0.707 | - alpha> ] / N. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Compute sin(2phi): 2 phi = -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the term inside the sqrt is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but how does this state look? It's a superposition of coherent states with opposite amplitudes. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, but their superposition isn't Gaussian.

Now, the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho (the state's density matrix) and the reference Gaussian state tau.

Wait, but relative entropy is usually defined between two states, and it's the difference in their entropies. So for del_b, it's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

But wait, the reference Gaussian state tau might be the one that is closest in some sense to rho. Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the reference is the thermal state or another Gaussian. Hmm. Alternatively, sometimes the reference is the state with the same first and second moments as rho but Gaussian. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the state |psi> is a pure state, then rho would be a pure state density matrix. The von Neumann entropy S(rho) would be zero because rho is a projector. But tau is a Gaussian state; I don't know if it's pure or mixed.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let's think about this. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is a pure state. The von Neumann entropy of rho is zero. What about tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps it's also a pure state. Then S(tau) would be zero, making del_b zero. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian, so nG shouldn't be zero.

Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state, which is mixed. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being calculated between the non-Gaussian state and the closest Gaussian state. In that case, the non-Gaussian state is not Gaussian, so the relative entropy would be positive.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should think about the properties of the state. For a Schrödinger cat state, it's highly non-Gaussian. So the relative entropy should be a positive value. But the options include 2.48, 0.25, 1.38, and zero.

Wait, but the question says, "Calculate the nG for phi = -pi/4 and alpha =0.5." So I need to compute this del_b.

But how?

Wait, the problem is about calculating the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and a Gaussian reference state. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the vacuum state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state and the best (closest) Gaussian approximation. The minimal relative entropy with a Gaussian state.

But calculating that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is being compared to a specific Gaussian state, such as a squeezed state or a coherent state.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps the state is Gaussian, which would make the del_b zero. But wait, earlier I thought the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, let me think again. The state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian. But their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy should be non-zero.

But wait, is there any case where the superposition of two coherent states is Gaussian? I don't think so.

Wait, what if the parameters phi and alpha are such that the state becomes Gaussian? For example, if the superposition is symmetric in some way, maybe it becomes a squeezed state.

Hmm, another thought: if the state is a squeezed vacuum state, it's Gaussian. But I'm not sure if |psi> as given can be expressed as a squeezed state.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is a Gaussian state for certain phi and alpha values. Let me check.

Wait, when phi is such that the coefficients in the superposition are equal and opposite, perhaps the state becomes a two-mode squeezed state or something else. But I'm not certain.

Let me think of the density matrix rho. For the state |psi>, rho is |psi><psi|. Since it's a pure state, rho is a projector. The density matrix of a Gaussian state would have specific properties, like their Wigner functions being Gaussian distributions.

But to compute the relative entropy, I'd need to compute the von Neumann entropy of rho and of tau.

Wait, rho is pure, so S(rho) = 0. What about tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, when is it pure? Only if it's a coherent state, squeezed state, or perhaps a Fock state (but Fock states are non-Gaussian except for n=0 and n=1, I think). Wait, coherent states are Gaussian and pure. So if tau is a coherent state, then S(tau)=0, so del_b would be zero. But that would imply the state is Gaussian, which I don't think it is.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is being considered between the state and a specific Gaussian state, like the vacuum or a coherent state. Let's think: if the state is a superposition, and the reference is the vacuum, then perhaps the relative entropy would be non-zero.

But I'm not sure about the exact approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a trick where the state is actually Gaussian, making nG zero. But earlier I thought that was unlikely.

Wait, maybe the state |psi> is a Gaussian state. Let me think about this.

Coherent states |alpha> are Gaussian. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Superpositions of Gaussian states are not Gaussian unless the coefficients are such that the state remains Gaussian.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the case where phi is pi/4. Then cos(phi) and sin(phi) are both sqrt(2)/2, so the state is (|alpha> + |-alpha>)/sqrt{2}, up to the normalization N. But in that case, is the state Gaussian?

Alternatively, perhaps when the phase phi is pi/2 or -pi/2, the state becomes something else.

Wait, but for phi = -pi/4, as in the problem, let's compute the state.

So in this case, the coefficients are cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.707. So the state is [0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 | -0.5> ] / N.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state is a symmetric superposition, so it's a coherent state as well. But I don't think so. Coherent states have |alpha>, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. A superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> would have a density matrix that's a mixture of these, but it's not a coherent state itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be expressed as a displaced squeezed vacuum state. Displaced squeezed states are Gaussian, so if the state |psi> can be written that way, then it would be Gaussian, making nG zero.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think of a displaced squeezed state. The general form is alpha (e^{r} |0> + e^{-r} |0> ) / sqrt{2 sinh(r)}, which is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, but perhaps for a single mode?

No, wait, a displaced squeezed state would be something like D(alpha) S(rho) |0>, where S is the squeezing operator. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be rewritten in terms of a displacement and squeezing.

Let me try to compute the density matrix. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. So rho = |psi><psi|.

The density matrices of Gaussian states have certain properties, like their Wigner functions being Gaussian, and their moments can be expressed in terms of normally ordered terms.

But I'm not sure how to proceed with computing the relative entropy here. Maybe the problem is designed so that the state is actually a Gaussian state, leading to del_b being zero.

Wait, let's think about the case when phi is such that sin(2phi) is zero. Then N becomes 1, because the sqrt term is 1. That would make the state (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / 1.

But sin(2phi) is zero when phi is 0, pi/2, etc. For phi =0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. For phi=pi/2, the state becomes | -alpha>, which is also Gaussian. So in those cases, |psi> is Gaussian, and nG is zero.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with opposite signs.

Wait, but could this be a Gaussian state? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, let me think about the quadrature variances. For a squeezed state, the variances of the position and momentum quadratures are squeezed (one is below the vacuum level, the other above). For a coherent state, both are at the vacuum level. For a cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the quadrature variances can be close to the vacuum level, but the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, maybe the state |psi> is a squeezed state, making it Gaussian. Let's think about the density matrix for |psi>.

Wait, the state |alpha> is a coherent state: |alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n/sqrt{n!}) |n>. Similarly, |-alpha> is another coherent state.

The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. So rho = |psi><psi| would involve terms like |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha> < -alpha|, and cross terms like |alpha><-alpha| and |-alpha><alpha|.

The cross terms would involve factors like e^{i(alpha + alpha^*)} or something. Wait, perhaps I can write the density matrix explicitly.

The state is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. So,

rho = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |-alpha><alpha| ]

Since N is the normalization factor, N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Now, what's the density matrix of a Gaussian state? Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Their density matrices have specific structures. For instance, the density matrix of a squeezed vacuum state can be written in terms of the squeeze parameter.

But in any case, the question is whether rho is a Gaussian state. For a Gaussian state, the Wigner function must be Gaussian, and the density matrix can be expressed in terms of normally ordered operators, like a a† terms.

Hmm, perhaps for this particular state, when phi is -pi/4 and alpha =0.5, the state becomes a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. If so, then nG would be zero.

Wait, let's think: for a squeezed vacuum state, the density matrix is |0><0| after squeezing, so it's pure. But in our case, the state |psi> is a superposition of coherent states, so it's a mixed state if N isn't 1.

Wait, wait. No, the state |psi> is a pure state, because it's a normalized superposition of two states. So rho is a pure state, and if |psi> is Gaussian, then its von Neumann entropy would be zero. But if tau is a Gaussian state, what is its entropy?

Wait, if tau is a Gaussian state, it could be pure or mixed. For example, a coherent state is pure, so S(tau) would be zero. But if the state |psi> is also Gaussian (like a squeezed state), then S(rho)=0 and S(tau)=0, so del_b would be zero.

But if the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, then tau would be a Gaussian state, perhaps the closest one, and del_b would be positive.

But I'm not sure whether the state is Gaussian or not in this specific case.

Another approach: perhaps the state is a coherent state. A coherent state is a single coherent state, not a superposition. So our state isn't a coherent state, so it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, but what if the superposition happens to form another coherent state? For example, |alpha> + |-alpha> could be something else. Let me compute that.

Wait, |alpha> + |-alpha> = e^{alpha a† - alpha a} |0> + e^{-alpha a† + alpha a} |0> .

I'm not sure if that simplifies to another coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the combination of the coefficients and the alpha leads to a Gaussian state. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state |psi> can be rewritten as a displaced squeezed vacuum state.

But I'm not confident about this. Maybe it's easier to compute the density matrix and check if it's Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the state's density matrix is Gaussian because it's a pure state, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: the state is a superposition of two coherent states. The Wigner function of a coherent state is a Gaussian centered at (alpha,0) in phase space. The Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states would have interference terms, leading to a non-Gaussian shape, like a cat state.

So the Wigner function of |psi> is non-Gaussian, meaning the state is non-Gaussian, so nG should be positive.

But the problem is asking for the numerical value of nG. Without knowing the exact formula for del_b, it's hard to compute.

Wait, maybe the relative entropy between the state and a reference Gaussian state tau is zero. But that would only happen if the state is Gaussian, which I don't think it is.

Alternatively, maybe the state is actually a Gaussian state in this case, making the relative entropy zero. How?

Wait, let me think about the specific parameters: phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So the normalization N is sqrt(1 + (-1) exp( -2*(0.5)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Compute 1 - exp(-0.5): exp(-0.5)≈0.6065, so 1-0.6065≈0.3935. So N≈0.6275.

So the state is (0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 | -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Hmm, maybe this is a squeezed vacuum state. Let me think about the squeezed vacuum state.

A squeezed vacuum state is generated by the squeezing operator S(r) acting on the vacuum. The squeezing operator is usually parameterized by r, which is real. The density matrix for the squeezed vacuum state is |0><0| after squeezing. So, it's a pure Gaussian state.

But how does that compare to our state |psi>? Our state is a superposition of two coherent states. I don't think that's the same as the squeezed vacuum state.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the density matrix of |psi> and see if it's Gaussian.

The density matrix rho = |psi><psi|.

Expanding rho, it's a combination of |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, and |-alpha><alpha|.

Each |alpha><alpha| is a Gaussian density matrix (since |alpha> is a coherent state, a Gaussian state). The cross terms, like |alpha><-alpha|, would have terms like e^{i( alpha * alpha^* )} or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the cross terms in rho would involve terms like |alpha><-alpha|, which would correspond to the density matrix of a squeezed thermal state perhaps? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms have a different structure. Let me think: the term |alpha><-alpha| can be written as |alpha><alpha| e^{i 2 Re(alpha) a† }, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms contribute to non-Gaussian features, like negative regions in the Wigner function. So, the presence of these terms would make the state non-Gaussian.

Thus, the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy nG would be positive.

But how do I compute the relative entropy without knowing the specific reference Gaussian state?

Hmm, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. Let me consider that possibility.

If tau is the vacuum state, its density matrix is |0><0|. The von Neumann entropy of the vacuum is zero.

The state rho is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero. Then del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but no. Wait, the relative entropy is between rho and tau. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). If tau is the vacuum, S(tau)=0. But rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, so del_b=0. But that would imply the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state isn't the vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. In that case, the relative entropy would be the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian rho and the closest Gaussian tau.

But calculating the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state would require optimization, which is beyond my current knowledge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity del_b is zero. Looking at the options, option D is zero. But I thought the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, maybe the state is actually Gaussian in this specific case. Let me think again.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5, let me compute the state more carefully.

The state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / N.

Which simplifies to [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / N.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(-pi/2) exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

So N is approximately sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [ (0.707)|0.5> - 0.707 | -0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, perhaps this is a squeezed vacuum state. Let me recall that a squeezed vacuum state can be written as a superposition of |n> with coefficients that depend on the squeeze parameter. But a coherent state is a superposition of |n> with coefficients e^{-|alpha|^2/2} (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)).

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> can be rewritten in terms of a squeezing operator applied to the vacuum.

Wait, but I'm not confident in this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a thermal state, which is Gaussian. But no, a thermal state is a mixed state, while |psi> is a pure state.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the density matrix and see if it's Gaussian.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi| = [ (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) (cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ) ] / N^2.

Expanding this, rho = [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) | - alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / N^2.

This can be written as (1/N^2) [ |alpha><alpha| (cos^2 phi) + |-alpha><-alpha| sin^2 phi + ... ].

But for a Gaussian state, the density matrix must be expressible in terms of normally ordered operators. Coherent states have density matrices that are Gaussian, but I'm not sure about the cross terms.

Wait, perhaps the cross terms can be expressed in terms of a displacement operator. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a squeezed vacuum state. The squeezed vacuum state is |0> after applying the squeezing operator S(r), where r is real. The density matrix is |0><0|, which is Gaussian.

But I don't think our state |psi> is a squeezed vacuum state because it's a superposition of two coherent states.

Wait, perhaps the cross terms in rho are zero. Let me compute the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>.

The inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2 - | - alpha |^2 + alpha (-alpha)^*} = e^{-2 |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2} = e^{- |alpha|^2}.

So it's not zero, which means the cross terms in rho are non-zero.

In this case, the density matrix rho has terms that mix |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the off-diagonal terms are non-zero and involve terms like e^{-|alpha|^2}.

I think this implies that the state is non-Gaussian because Gaussian states have density matrices that are mixtures of Gaussian distributions, without interference terms that would cause non-Gaussian features.

Therefore, the relative entropy should be non-zero, so the nG is not zero. So option D is incorrect.

Now, I'm stuck because I don't know how to compute the relative entropy without more information. The problem gives the relative entropy formula, but I don't know the specific reference Gaussian state.

Wait, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum. Let me think: if tau is the vacuum, then its density matrix is |0><0|, and its entropy is zero. The state rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. So del_b would be zero. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian state. But calculating that would require more advanced methods.

Alternatively, perhaps for this specific case, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But I don't see why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state |psi> is actually a Gaussian state because the cross terms in rho are such that the Wigner function remains Gaussian. For example, if the cross terms result in terms that preserve Gaussianity, like in a squeezed state.

Wait, the Wigner function of a squeezed vacuum state is Gaussian because it's a minimum uncertainty state, but the Wigner function of a superposition of coherent states (like a cat state) has a non-Gaussian shape, such as two-peak structure.

So, the Wigner function of |psi> in this case would be non-Gaussian, meaning the state is non-Gaussian.

Therefore, the relative entropy should be a positive value, so nG is non-zero. Looking at the options, options A, B, and C are positive.

But how to compute the exact value?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trick where the state is actually Gaussian, leading to nG zero.

Wait, maybe the state can be rewritten as a displaced thermal state or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state |psi> is a squeezed vacuum state, making it Gaussian and thus nG = 0, which is option D.

But I'm not certain about this. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, another angle: Gaussian states have a density matrix that can be written in terms of the number operator and displacement operator. Let me think if rho can be written that way.

The density matrix rho has terms involving |alpha><alpha|, etc. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a coherent state displaced in phase space, which would make it Gaussian. But no, it's a superposition of two different coherent states.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the state |psi> is a squeezed state.

Wait, a squeezed state can be written as S(r) D(alpha) |0>, where S is the squeezing operator and D is the displacement operator. For a squeezed vacuum state, alpha is zero.

But I don't know if |psi> can be expressed in this form.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be expressed as a squeezed state. Let me see.

The squeezing operator S(r) acts on the vacuum to produce a squeezed vacuum state. The density matrix is |0><0| after squeezing, which is pure.

But our state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which seems different.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain values of alpha and phi, the state |psi> becomes a squeezed state. Let me think about this.

Wait, when alpha is real and positive, and phi is -pi/4, perhaps the state can be expressed as a squeezed state.

But I'm not sure. I think without more specific knowledge, I can't proceed further.

Given the options, and the fact that the problem is multiple-choice, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state.

Wait, think about the expectation values. Gaussian states have all even moments and their correlation functions follow certain properties. Let me think about the expectation value of a^2, which may be zero for a Gaussian state, but perhaps not for a non-Gaussian one.

Wait, coherent states have <a^2> = alpha^2. The state |psi> is a superposition, so <a^2> would be [cos^2(phi) <alpha|a^2|alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a^2 | - alpha> + cross terms].

Since <alpha|a^2|alpha> = alpha^2, similarly < - alpha | a^2 | - alpha> = (-alpha)^2 = alpha^2.

So the expectation value would be [cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)] alpha^2 = alpha^2.

Which is the same as for a coherent state. So this doesn't distinguish between Gaussian and non-Gaussian.

Hmm, maybe higher-order moments would show the non-Gaussianity.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state, making nG zero. But I can't be sure.

Another thought: perhaps the state can be written as a product state, implying it's Gaussian. But a superposition of coherent states isn't a product state.

I'm really stuck here. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the state is non-Gaussian, and the answer is one of the other options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2.48

B) 0.25

C) 1.38

D) 0

If the state is Gaussian, the answer is D) 0. But if it's non-Gaussian, the answer is non-zero.

But earlier, I thought the state is non-Gaussian, so the nG should be non-zero. So the answer is not D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: when phi is -pi/4, sin(2phi)= -1. So the normalization N is sqrt(1 - exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, for alpha=0.5, 2 alpha^2 =0.5, so exp(-0.5)=0.6065. So N= sqrt(0.3935)= approx 0.6275.

So the state is (0.707 |0.5> -0.707 | -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, perhaps this is a squeezed state. Let's think about the quadrature variances. For a squeezed state, the variance in one quadrature is lower than the vacuum, and higher in the other.

The coherent state |alpha> has quadrature variances equal to the vacuum. The state |psi> is a superposition, so its variances might be lower, like in a squeezed state.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the state's density matrix can be written in terms of a squeezing operator.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, so nG is positive.

But without being able to compute the relative entropy, I can't know the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the state is actually Gaussian when phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5. So the answer is D) 0.

But I don't know. Another approach: perhaps the state is a thermal state, which is Gaussian. But a thermal state is mixed, while |psi> is a pure state. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, but that's a two-mode state, not single mode.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, so non-zero nG. But I can't compute the exact value.

Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 1.38. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, making nG zero. But I can't confirm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the state's Wigner function. If it's a cat state, the Wigner function would have negative regions, indicating non-Gaussianity. But without knowing the exact form, I can't be certain.

Given that the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite amplitudes, I think it's a non-Gaussian state. Hence, the nG should be non-zero.

The options are A:2.48, B:0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

But without being able to compute the exact value, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm really not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, the state becomes a squeezed vacuum state, making it Gaussian, so nG=0.

But I don't remember the exact form of a squeezed state. 

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state, but that's only true when phi is 0, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since I'm not confident, perhaps the answer is D) 0. But I'm not certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \), and the parameters are \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The relative entropy is given by:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the State**:  
   The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian. This suggests that \(|\psi\rangle\) is likely a non-Gaussian state.

2. **Normalization Constant**:  
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

3. **Density Matrix**:  
   The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) expands into terms involving \(|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha|\), \(|-\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha|\), and cross terms like \(|\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha|\). These cross terms suggest interference effects, which are typically associated with non-Gaussian states.

4. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian**:  
   Gaussian states, such as coherent or squeezed states, have density matrices that can be expressed in terms of normally ordered operators, and their Wigner functions are Gaussian. The given state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of coherent states, which generally results in a non-Gaussian Wigner function. This implies that \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian.

5. **Relative Entropy**:  
   The relative entropy \(\text{del}_b\) measures the difference in von Neumann entropies between \(\rho\) and \(\tau\), where \(\tau\) is a reference Gaussian state. Since \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian, \(\text{del}_b\) is expected to be positive, indicating non-zero non-Gaussianity.

6. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This is a positive value, consistent with a non-Gaussian state. However, the exact computation of \(\text{del}_b\) is not performed, so this value cannot be confirmed directly.  
   - **Option B (0.25)**: Another positive value, but similarly, the exact computation is not performed.  
   - **Option C (1.38)**: A positive value that could represent the relative entropy for a non-Gaussian state.  
   - **Option D (0)**: This would imply that the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the analysis of the state as a superposition of coherent states.

### Conclusion:
The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian, and the relative entropy \(\text{del}_b\) is expected to be positive. However, without explicit computation of \(\text{del}_b\), the exact value cannot be determined. Based on the reasoning provided, the most plausible answer is **D) 0**, as it might suggest that the state simplifies to a Gaussian form under the given parameters. This conclusion is made with some uncertainty.
