Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, which is S_y. The options are given as A to D. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, where A is the operator. So for spin along y, the operator is S_y.

I think the spin operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times each of these matrices. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix given in the problem.

Looking at the σ_y matrix, it's given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. That makes sense.

The electron's spin state is given as (3i, 4). I think this is a column vector in the spinor form. So the state |ψ⟩ is [3i; 4], which can be written as a vector with components ψ₁ and ψ₂.

Wait, so to compute the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ, right? Because the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by S_y, multiplied by ψ.

Wait, but S_y is a matrix, so let me get the steps right. Let me write down each part.

First, ψ is the state vector [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3 (since 3i conjugated is -3i?), wait no, the conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no: 3i is a purely imaginary number. The conjugate would be -3i, right? So ψ† would be a row vector with entries -3i and 4*, which is 4, since it's real.

Wait, wait a second. The state is (3i,4). So ψ is a column vector: [3i; 4]. So the conjugate transpose, ψ†, would be [ 3i*, 4* ] as a row vector. Since 3i is a complex number, its conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the original vector is (3i,4). So each component is 3i and 4. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is still 4. So ψ† is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. So let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix is:

[ [0, -i*(ħ/2)],
  [i*(ħ/2), 0] ]

Wait, no. Because σ_y is the matrix, so S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. So S_y is:

(ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Which becomes:

[ [0, (-i)(ħ/2) ],
  [ (i)(ħ/2), 0 ] ]

So the matrix S_y is:

Row 1: 0, (-iħ/2)
Row 2: (iħ/2), 0

Now, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute S_y * ψ. ψ is [3i; 4], so let's multiply S_y by ψ.

Multiplying each element:

First element (top row of S_y times ψ):
0*(3i) + (-iħ/2)*4
= 0 + (-i *4 * ħ/2)
= (-4i ħ)/2
= -2i ħ.

Second element (bottom row of S_y times ψ):
(iħ/2)*3i + 0*4
= (iħ/2)(3i) + 0
= (3i² ħ)/2
But i² is -1, so this becomes (3*(-1) ħ)/2 = (-3 ħ)/2.

So S_y * ψ = [ -2i ħ; (-3 ħ)/2 ]

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so we need to multiply ψ† by S_y * ψ.

So ψ† (S_y ψ) = (-3i)(-2i ħ) + (4)( (-3 ħ/2) )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ)
Multiply the coefficients: (-3i) * (-2i) = (6 i²) = 6*(-1) = -6. So the first term is (-6 ħ).

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ/2) = (4 * (-3/2)) * ħ = (-12/2) * ħ = (-6 ħ).

So adding both terms: (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = (-12 ħ).

Wait, but wait, I'm forgetting the S_y is multiplied by ħ/2, so in the calculation above, perhaps I should include that factor correctly.

Wait, let me retrace. Oh wait, wait no. Because in S_y, we included the (ħ/2) already. So the matrix elements are (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix.

Wait, but wait, how did I compute S_y times ψ? Let me recheck that.

Wait no, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recompute S_y times ψ.

Wait, S_y is:

[ [ 0, (-iħ/2) ],
  [ (iħ/2), 0 ] ]

So when I multiply S_y with ψ, which is [3i;4], I get:

Top component: (0)(3i) + (-i ħ/2)(4)
= 0 + [ (-i)(4) * ħ/2 ]
= (-4i ħ)/2
= -2i ħ.

Bottom component: (i ħ/2)(3i) + 0*(4)
= (i *3i ) * (ħ/2)
= (3 i²) * (ħ/2)
= 3*(-1) * ħ/2
= (-3 ħ)/2.

So that part is correct.

Then, ψ† (which is [ -3i, 4 ]) multiplied by S_y ψ ([ -2i ħ; (-3 ħ)/2 ]).

So the first term is (-3i) * (-2i ħ) 

= (-3i) * (-2i ħ) 

Multiply the terms:

(-3i)*(-2i) = 6 i² = 6*(-1) = -6.

So term1 = (-6) * ħ.

Second term: 4 * [ (-3 ħ)/2 ] = (4 * (-3/2 )) * ħ = (-12/2) * ħ = -6 ħ.

So total expectation value is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but wait, the expectation value is in units of ħ/2, because S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. Or no, wait no, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so when you compute the expectation value, you're using that operator.

Wait, but in my calculation above, when I multiplied the matrices, I included the (ħ/2) factor in S_y, so the result should already account for that. So the expectation value I found is -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, option B is 12 ħ/25.

Hmm, my result here is -12 ħ, but none of the options have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations step by step.

First, the state ψ is [3i;4]. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y is:

[ [0, (-i)(ħ/2)],
  [i*(ħ/2), 0] ]

Now, compute S_y * ψ:

ψ is [3i;4].

S_y ψ:

Top component: 0 * 3i + (-iħ/2) *4 = 0 + (-i *4 * ħ/2) = (-4i * ħ)/2 = -2i ħ.

Bottom component: (i ħ/2)*3i + 0*4 = (i*3i * ħ/2) + 0 = 3 i² * ħ/2 = 3*(-1) * ħ/2 = -3 ħ/2.

So S_y ψ is [ -2i ħ; (-3 ħ/2) ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Compute ψ† S_y ψ: (-3i)(-2i ħ) + 4*(-3 ħ/2).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-2i ħ) = (6 i²) ħ = 6*(-1) ħ = -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3 ħ/2) = (4 * (-3)/2 ) ħ = (-12/2) ħ = -6 ħ.

Adding both: -6 ħ + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I messed up the state vector's components. Are the components 3i and 4, or is the state (3i,4) in another form?

Wait, perhaps the state is given as (3i, 4), which is a row vector. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are column vectors. So ψ is [3i;4], which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be using ψ as a row vector, but no, because in expectation value calculations, it's ψ† times operator times ψ.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should normalize the state vector. Oh wait, the given state is (3i,4). So the norm would be |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized, because sqrt(25)=5. So when I calculate the expectation value, I should perhaps normalize the state. Or does that affect the result?

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), because the state isn't normalized. Or no— wait, wait.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value formula is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state. However, if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, the formula would be ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

But since the problem statement gives the state as (3i,4), perhaps it's assumed to be normalized. Let me check: |3i|^2 = 9, |4|^2 =16. Sum is 25, so the square root is 5. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized. So in the expectation value calculation, I should normalize it.

Wait, but when you compute the expectation value, the formula without normalization is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ). Because in that case, the state is not normalized. So perhaps I missed this step.

Oh! I think that's where I went wrong. Because I didn't normalize the state, the expectation value I computed is not correct. So I need to compute ⟨S_y⟩ as (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

So let's compute ψ† ψ first.

ψ is [3i;4]. So ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

ψ† ψ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = (-3i)(3i) + 16.

Compute (-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9 (-1) = 9.

So ψ† ψ = 9 +16 =25.

So the normalization factor is 25, so the norm is 5, but in the denominator, it's 25.

So now, the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ).

Earlier, I got ψ† S_y ψ = -12 ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, no: earlier, I computed ψ† S_y ψ as (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ. But that was without considering the normalization. So the correct expectation value is (-12 ħ) divided by 25.

Wait, because (ψ† S_y ψ) is -12 ħ, and (ψ† ψ) is 25, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, which matches.

Wait, but why is the expectation value negative? Let me think. The spin state is (3i,4), so let me think about what that implies. But perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should have considered the expectation value as (ψ† S_y ψ) without normalization, but I'm not sure. But the formula for expectation value when the state isn't normalized is ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩)).

So yes, I should have divided by 25.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ) / 25, which is option A.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I didn't divide by 25. Let me recalculate that.

Earlier, when I computed ψ† S_y ψ, I got -12 ħ.

But since the state is not normalized, the correct expectation value is (-12 ħ) /25.

Looking at the options:

Option A is -12 ħ/25.

So the answer should be option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger S_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
\]

### Step 1: Define the operator \( S_y \)
The spin operator along the y-direction is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) as:

\[
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
\]
where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \). Substituting, we get:

\[
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\hbar/2 \\ i\hbar/2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) for normalization
The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Its conjugate transpose is:

\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\psi^\dagger \psi = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( \psi^\dagger \psi = 25 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( S_y \psi \)
We calculate \( S_y \psi \) as:

\[
S_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\hbar/2 \\ i\hbar/2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

- Top component:
\[
0 \cdot (3i) + \left(-\frac{i\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot 4 = -\frac{4i\hbar}{2} = -2i\hbar.
\]

- Bottom component:
\[
\left(\frac{i\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot (3i) + 0 \cdot 4 = \frac{3i^2\hbar}{2} = \frac{3(-1)\hbar}{2} = -\frac{3\hbar}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
S_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -2i\hbar \\ -\frac{3\hbar}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \psi^\dagger S_y \psi \)
Now, calculate \( \psi^\dagger S_y \psi \):

\[
\psi^\dagger S_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -2i\hbar \\ -\frac{3\hbar}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

- First term:
\[
(-3i)(-2i\hbar) = 6i^2\hbar = 6(-1)\hbar = -6\hbar.
\]

- Second term:
\[
4 \cdot \left(-\frac{3\hbar}{2}\right) = -6\hbar.
\]

Adding these:

\[
\psi^\dagger S_y \psi = -6\hbar + (-6\hbar) = -12\hbar.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the expectation value
The expectation value is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger S_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
