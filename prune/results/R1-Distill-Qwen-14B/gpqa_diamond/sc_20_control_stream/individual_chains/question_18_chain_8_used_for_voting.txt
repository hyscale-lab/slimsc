Alright, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the mass might not directly come into play for this particular problem. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres based on their elemental abundances. 

From the data given, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex. Hmm, I remember that these brackets represent logarithmic abundance ratios. The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7.

So, the goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute the ratio.

Wait, how do these abundance ratios work? The notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance relative to the Sun. 

Let me jot down the given data for clarity.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

And the Sun's values:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio (Star_1's [Si/H] divided by Star_2's [Si/H]) and convert that back to a number ratio.

Let me think about Star_1 first. 

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^(-4.5).

And [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that's log10((nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun) ) = 0.3. 

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Which means (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I know (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * 10^0 = same as Sun. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to Sun. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe)_sun * (nH)_1 / (nH)_sun. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the overall metallicity (Fe abundance) is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH = same as Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. The [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So 0.3 = log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) )

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), the equation simplifies to 0.3 = log( nSi_1 / nSi_sun ). So (nSi_1 / nSi_sun) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi_1 = 2 * nSi_sun.

Wait, wait, but nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun. So (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Therefore, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1: 

[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H. So nFe_1 = same as Sun's nFe.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0, then nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Let me compute nSi_1 in terms of nH.

nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun. So nSi_sun = (nFe_sun) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = but wait, perhaps I should find [Si/H]_1.

We can express [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun / nH_sun).

But how to get nSi_1/nH_1?

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

Let me think about the ratios:

From Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), then nSi_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3 = nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So the ratio nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3) / nH_1.

But the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5-12= -4.5. Wait, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). So nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [Si/H]_1.

[Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

We can express nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1 / nH_1).

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

So nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * 10^(-4.5).

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, we have nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nSi_sun/nFe_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun, which is the solar ratio. So let's compute that. 

nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi/nH_sun) / (nFe/nH_sun) ) = (nSi/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nFe) ) = (nSi/nH) * (nH/nFe) ) = (nSi/nFe) = [Si/Fe]_sun + log(10^12)? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is given by log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). Wait, no, the [X/Y] for the Sun is zero because it's the reference. So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0. So, nSi_sun/nFe_sun = nSun's ratio, which is 10^0=1.

Wait, that's not correct. Because [X/Y] is measured relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]=0, so log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = 0 → log(nX/nY) = log(nX_sun/nY_sun) → nX/nY = nX_sun / nY_sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → nSi_sun / nFe_sun =1 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

Wait, that can't be right because the Sun's atmosphere isn't primarily silicon. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not zero. Oh wait, no, because [X/Y] is defined relative to the Sun. So for the Sun itself, [X/Y] is zero because it's the reference. So, for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → so nSi_sun/nFe_sun = 1 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

Wait, but that would mean that in the Sun, the number of Si atoms equals the number of Fe atoms, which I'm not sure is accurate, but perhaps that's how the problem is set up.

So in the Sun, nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 = 1 * 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun → which is nFe_sun = (nFe/nH_sun)_sun * nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Wait, nH_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. But how does that compare to the Sun's hydrogen?

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (10^([Fe/H]_1)) ) = nFe_sun * 10^0 = nFe_sun.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3 = nFe_sun * 1 * 10^0.3 = nFe_sun * 2.0.

Now, to find nSi_1/nH_1: 

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nFe_sun * 2.0) / nH_1.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → which is 10^(-4.5).

So, nFe_sun = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I should express nH_1 in terms of the Sun's. Let's think about the metallicity.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So if the Sun's Fe/H is 10^(-4.5), then Star_1's Fe/H is also 10^(-4.5). So nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

But since nFe_1 is also nFe_sun, which is 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun, then:

nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) * nH_sun = nFe_1 =10^(-4.5)*nH_1 → So,

nH_1 = nH_sun * (nFe_sun / nFe_1) ) → Wait, nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun, so nH_1 = nH_sun.

Wait, that can't be right because the stars might have different total H, but perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen is the same? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps nH_1 can be expressed as nH_sun multiplied by some factor, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Since [Fe/H]_1 =0, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Wait, that's a useful relationship! Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]. Since Y is Fe in this case. So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's see.

Star_2's data: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

We need to find [Si/H]_2.

Again, using [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

If I take Y as Mg, then [Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2.

But wait, [Si/Mg] is the negative of [Mg/Si], because [Mg/Si] = 0.3 implies [Si/Mg] = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = (−0.3) + 0 = −0.3.

Wait, so:

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 0.3
Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3

That's a neat way to find their [Si/H] values.

Now, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

But [Si/H] is log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log10(nSi/nH / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)).

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → 10^(0.3) = nSi_1/(nH_1) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun).

Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio as (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) = (nSi_1/nSi_2) * (nH_2/nH_1).

But I don't know the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, but perhaps the ratio of nSi_1/nSi_2 can be found using their [Si/H] values relative to the Sun.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log10(nSi_2/nH_2) = -0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Because when you take the ratio, the logs subtract. So [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6 → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.98, so option A is ~3.9.

Wait, but wait. Because [Si/H] is measured relative to the Sun, perhaps the ratio of (nSi_1/nH_1) to (nSi_2/nH_2) is 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

But let me make sure. Let me compute:

(nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (10^{[Si/H]_1}) / (10^{[Si/H]_2}) ) = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Given [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, the difference is 0.6. So 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

Wait, but wait. The Sun's [Si/H] is given as 12 + log10(nSi/nH) =7. So log10(nSi/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nSi/nH =1e-5.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10(nSi_1/nH_1 / (1e-5)) )=0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 1e-5 * 10^0.3 ≈ 1e-5 * 2 ≈ 2e-5.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = 1e-5 * 10^{-0.3} ≈ 1e-5 * 0.5 ≈ 5e-6.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (2e-5) / (5e-6) )= 4. So the ratio is 4. Which aligns with option A.

Thus, the answer should be A) ~3.9.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1
The abundance ratio [Si/H] is defined as:
\[
[\text{Si/H}] = [\text{Si/Fe}] + [\text{Fe/H}]
\]
For Star_1:
\[
[\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 + [\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2, we first note that [Si/Mg] is the negative of [Mg/Si]:
\[
[\text{Si/Mg}]_2 = -[\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = -0.3
\]
Using the relationship:
\[
[\text{Si/H}] = [\text{Si/Mg}] + [\text{Mg/H}]
\]
For Star_2:
\[
[\text{Si/H}]_2 = [\text{Si/Mg}]_2 + [\text{Mg/H}]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**

Alright, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

Let me jot down the given data for clarity.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

And the Sun's values:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio (Star_1's [Si/H] divided by Star_2's [Si/H]) and convert that back to a number ratio.

Let me think about Star_1 first. 

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^(-4.5).

And [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So that's log10((nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun) ) = 0.3. 

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Which means (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But I know (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * 10^0 = same as Sun. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to Sun. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe_1 = (nFe)_sun * (nH)_1 / (nH)_sun. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the overall metallicity (Fe abundance) is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH = same as Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. The [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So 0.3 = log( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) )

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), the equation simplifies to 0.3 = log( nSi_1 / nSi_sun ). So (nSi_1 / nSi_sun) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi_1 = 2 * nSi_sun.

Wait, wait, but nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun. So (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Therefore, nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1: 

[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H. So nFe_1 = same as Sun's nFe.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun, because [Fe/H]_1=0, then nSi_1 = nFe_sun * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Let me compute nSi_1 in terms of nH.

nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun. So nSi_sun = (nFe_sun) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = but wait, perhaps I should find [Si/H]_1.

We can express [Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun / nH_sun).

But how to get nSi_1/nH_1?

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1=0.

Let me think about the ratios:

From Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe_1 = nFe_sun (because [Fe/H]_1=0), then nSi_1 = (nFe_sun) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3 = nSi_sun * 10^0.3.

So the ratio nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_sun * 10^0.3) / nH_1.

But the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5-12= -4.5. Wait, nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). So nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Similarly, nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I should compute [Si/H]_1.

[Si/H]_1 = log10(nSi_1/nH_1) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

We can express nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1 / nH_1).

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

So nSi_1/nH_1 = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * 10^(-4.5).

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, we have nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nSi_sun/nFe_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun, which is the solar ratio. So let's compute that. 

nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi/nH_sun) / (nFe/nH_sun) ) = (nSi/nH_sun) * (nH_sun/nFe) ) = (nSi/nH) * (nH/nFe) ) = (nSi/nFe) = [Si/Fe]_sun + log(10^12)? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is given by log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). Wait, no, the [X/Y] for the Sun is zero because it's the reference. So [Si/Fe]_sun = 0. So, nSi_sun/nFe_sun = nSun's ratio, which is 10^0=1.

Wait, that's not correct. Because [X/Y] is measured relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]=0, so log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = 0 → log(nX/nY) = log(nX_sun/nY_sun) → nX/nY = nX_sun / nY_sun.

So, [Si/Fe]_sun =0 → nSi_sun / nFe_sun =1 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

Wait, that can't be right because the Sun's atmosphere isn't primarily silicon. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is not zero. Oh wait, no, because [X/Y] is defined relative to the Sun. So for the Sun itself, [X/Y] is zero because it's the reference. So, for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → so nSi_sun/nFe_sun = 1 → nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

Wait, but that would mean that in the Sun, the number of Si atoms equals the number of Fe atoms, which I'm not sure is accurate, but perhaps that's how the problem is set up.

So in the Sun, nSi_sun = nFe_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*10^0.3 = 1 * 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 = nFe_sun → which is nFe_sun = (nFe/nH_sun)_sun * nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Wait, nH_1 is the hydrogen in Star_1. But how does that compare to the Sun's hydrogen?

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of the Sun's abundances.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (10^([Fe/H]_1)) ) = nFe_sun * 10^0 = nFe_sun.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) * 10^0.3 = nFe_sun * 1 * 10^0.3 = nFe_sun * 2.0.

Now, to find nSi_1/nH_1: 

nSi_1/nH_1 = (nFe_sun * 2.0) / nH_1.

But [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → which is 10^(-4.5).

So, nFe_sun = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps I should express nH_1 in terms of the Sun's. Let's think about the metallicity.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So if the Sun's Fe/H is 10^(-4.5), then Star_1's Fe/H is also 10^(-4.5). So nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

But since nFe_1 is also nFe_sun, which is 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun, then:

nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) * nH_sun = nFe_1 =10^(-4.5)*nH_1 → So,

nH_1 = nH_sun * (nFe_sun / nFe_1) ) → Wait, nFe_1 is same as nFe_sun, so nH_1 = nH_sun.

Wait, that can't be right because the stars might have different total H, but perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen is the same? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps nH_1 can be expressed as nH_sun multiplied by some factor, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express [Si/H]_1 in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Since [Fe/H]_1 =0, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Wait, that's a useful relationship! Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]. Since Y is Fe in this case. So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, let's see.

Star_2's data: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

We need to find [Si/H]_2.

Again, using [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H].

If I take Y as Mg, then [Si/H]_2 = [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2.

But wait, [Si/Mg] is the negative of [Mg/Si], because [Mg/Si] = 0.3 implies [Si/Mg] = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = (−0.3) + 0 = −0.3.

Wait, so:

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = 0.3
Star_2: [Si/H]_2 = -0.3

That's a neat way to find their [Si/H] values.

Now, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2).

But [Si/H] is log10(nSi/nH) - log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun) = log10(nSi/nH / (nSi_sun/nH_sun)).

So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → 10^(0.3) = nSi_1/(nH_1) * (nH_sun/nSi_sun).

Wait, perhaps I should express the ratio as (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) = (nSi_1/nSi_2) * (nH_2/nH_1).

But I don't know the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm, but perhaps the ratio of nSi_1/nSi_2 can be found using their [Si/H] values relative to the Sun.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → log10(nSi_1/nH_1) = 0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → log10(nSi_2/nH_2) = -0.3 + log10(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So, the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Because when you take the ratio, the logs subtract. So [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6 → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 3.98, so option A is ~3.9.

Wait, but wait. Because [Si/H] is measured relative to the Sun, perhaps the ratio of (nSi_1/nH_1) to (nSi_2/nH_2) is 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

But let me make sure. Let me compute:

(nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (10^{[Si/H]_1}) / (10^{[Si/H]_2}) ) = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Given [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, the difference is 0.6. So 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is option A: ~3.9.

Wait, but wait. The Sun's [Si/H] is given as 12 + log10(nSi/nH) =7. So log10(nSi/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nSi/nH =1e-5.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → which is log10(nSi_1/nH_1 / (1e-5)) )=0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 1e-5 * 10^0.3 ≈ 1e-5 * 2 ≈ 2e-5.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → nSi_2/nH_2 = 1e-5 * 10^{-0.3} ≈ 1e-5 * 0.5 ≈ 5e-6.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) = (2e-5) / (5e-6) )= 4. So the ratio is 4. Which aligns with option A.

Thus, the answer should be A) ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1
The abundance ratio [Si/H] is defined as:
\[
[\text{Si/H}] = [\text{Si/Fe}] + [\text{Fe/H}]
\]
For Star_1:
\[
[\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 + [\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2, we first note that [Si/Mg] is the negative of [Mg/Si]:
\[
[\text{Si/Mg}]_2 = -[\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = -0.3
\]
Using the relationship:
\[
[\text{Si/H}] = [\text{Si/Mg}] + [\text{Mg/H}]
\]
For Star_2:
\[
[\text{Si/H}]_2 = [\text{Si/Mg}]_2 + [\text{Mg/H}]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{[\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
