Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to work through it.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step.

First, the first step: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. This would form an alkene. So, the product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is in excess and heated, it's likely an elimination to form 1,3-cycloaddition or maybe a different structure. But wait, wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, right? Because in adamantane, the structure is diamond-like, so the positions are such that 1 and 3 are adjacent.

So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, I think. Or maybe between C1 and C3. Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Because in E2, the H and Br are removed from adjacent carbons. Wait, no, E2 is between adjacent carbons. So if the bromines are on 1 and 3, but are they adjacent? Hmm, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is bonded to three others, forming a diamond lattice. So the positions 1 and 3 might be two bonds apart. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br are on carbons that are not adjacent. Then elimination would not be possible via E2 because the two leaving groups are on non-adjacent carbons. Wait, but maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if they're not adjacent, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe they're on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and each carbon is connected in a way that's tetrahedral. So the 1 and 3 positions are diagonally opposite on a face, maybe not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the bromines are on adjacent carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination, but maybe a substitution. Oh wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Maybe it's undergoing a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would require adjacent leaving groups, which I don't think it has. So maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide or something else. Wait, but the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region consistent with an alcohol or maybe an ether, but wait, another possibility is an epoxide. But wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's an elimination forming an alkene, which upon reaction with KOH would give an epoxide? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom, possibly an ether, or maybe an epoxide. Or maybe it's a diol. Wait, but the product is made by heating with KOH, which is a base. If product 1 has 2H at 4.79, perhaps it's an epoxide. Because epoxide protons tend to be around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a more deshielded environment. Alternatively, another possibility is a geminal diol, but that's less likely. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a base like KOH, they can form an alkene via elimination. However, if the base is in excess and the reaction is done under specific conditions, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diol. But no, KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile; substitution would require a good leaving group. Wait, but the product after KOH is product 1, which has an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong absorption, which could correspond to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution to form a diol. But wait, substitution with KOH would require two substitution steps, but that would form a diol. But then, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 doesn't fit a diol. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with excess KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, forming an alkane with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. No, that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl peak. So perhaps product 1 is an ester or a ketone. So how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually involves ketones and introduces an oxygen. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution forming a ketone. But wait, that would require a good leaving group and the formation of a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to coupling. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, which could cause a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Then, in presence of more KOH, perhaps the alkene undergoes epoxidation. But KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation; that's more done with peracids.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. So, if elimination forms an epoxide, the NMR would show a triplet or something else around 4 ppm. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the epoxide isn't the right product.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O. That would be an epoxide's structure. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. If the reaction forms a ketone, the IR would show a strong peak at around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the data. So how would a dihalide form a ketone with KOH?

Hmm, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then perhaps some further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Or maybe a nucleophilic substitution where the base removes the bromide, and then another substitution, but that would form a diol if the hydroxide attacks both carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a double substitution forming a diol. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH. Each Br is replaced by OH, forming 1,3-diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually broad around 3300 cm^-1. But the given IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the product is not a diol but a ketone. How? Well, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the structure rearranges. Wait, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, maybe elimination forms an alkene, and then the alkene undergoes some reaction to form a carbonyl. But under what conditions? Maybe ozonolysis, but that's a later step in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, and then maybe another reaction, but in the presence of KOH, perhaps it's more about elimination than addition. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because when dihalides are treated with a base, especially in a specific way, they can form epoxides. Wait, but I thought epoxides form from alkenes with peracids. Oh wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of an epoxide. But I'm not entirely sure about that mechanism. Let me think: vicinal dihalides can form epoxides under certain conditions, like with a base. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, forms an epoxide. So product 1 would be adamantane epoxide.

In that case, the NMR would show the protons on the epoxide. Epoxide protons are typically deshielded and appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm, maybe as a triplet or another pattern. But in the given data, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H. That might correspond to the epoxide's CH2 group, but wait, epoxides are usually three-membered rings, so each carbon has two substituents. But in adamantane, the epoxide would be a bridge, perhaps. So the structure would have each oxygen connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between two CH groups.

Wait, the NMR in product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a doublet. Wait, no, in the question, it's written as 4.79(2H), so probably a doublet or triplet. But without knowing the splitting, it's a bit hard.

But moving on, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I thought was a carbonyl. So maybe that's not an epoxide. Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a ketone, formed via elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ring. Let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form a ring. So in the adamantane structure, the elimination would form a bridge, leading to a bicyclic structure with a double bond.

But then, what would be the product? Maybe a bicyclo structure with a double bond, but how would that lead to a carbonyl in the IR?

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, but that doesn't seem to fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a geminal diol, but that's unlikely because KOH isn't a strong enough acid for that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is a ketone. So in the IR, 1720 cm^-1 is a ketone. So how would that form? Let's think of a possible mechanism. Maybe each bromide is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then some kind of elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require a neighboring group effect, which might not be feasible in adamantane's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to a substitution where one Br is replaced by OH, and then another elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl. But that seems a bit forced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the two Br atoms are replaced by an oxygen, leading to a ketone. Wait, but how? If two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and gain an O, that could form a carbonyl group. Let me imagine: if two CH2Br groups become CH(O) groups, but that would require the two oxygens to be adjacent, which would form a carbonyl. So perhaps the dihalide, upon treatment with KOH, forms a diketone? But that doesn't seem right because two carbonyls adjacent would likely form an enone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a single substitution. If one Br is replaced by OH, and the other by something else, but that's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the second step and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in alkylation or acylation reactions. Alternatively, it's used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but I'm not sure what's happening here.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might facilitate some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without knowing what product 1 is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might cause ring-opening. But under what conditions? Acidic conditions would open epoxides, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can act as a catalyst in such reactions.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

But wait, the third product's NMR is the target, and the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So let's think, after ozonolysis, we would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The most deshielded proton would be near the carbonyl group.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and any protons near them would be deshielded.

Wait, but ozonolysis usually cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups on each fragment. So if the starting material (product 2) has a double bond, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

So, let me try to piece this together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR 1720 cm^-1, so ketone) via some reaction with KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe AlCl3 is used in Friedel-Crafts, but perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, but perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and heating with Al(OiPr)3 leads to acid-catalyzed ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton, which is not exchanged (so not an -OH proton). So, in product 3, which is after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Let me think about ozonolysis. Suppose the double bond in product 2 is between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would cleave it, and each fragment would have a carbonyl group at the site of cleavage. So if the original alkene was symmetric, the ozonolysis product would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a low temperature, so it's likely controlled conditions, perhaps not leading to overoxidation. Also, the work-up is with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a mild reductant, so it might prevent further oxidation and just break the ozonides into carbonyls.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR would show protons near these groups, which are deshielded.

Now, considering the coupling patterns. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The splitting would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps each proton in the CH2 would couple with the neighboring group.

But wait, let's think about a specific structure. Suppose product 2 has a trans double bond, and after ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. Let's say each fragment has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CHO. Wait, no. Alternatively, each fragment might have a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two separate carbonyl compounds. But without knowing the exact structure of product 2, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about each step and possible structures.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Given the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH? One possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group, and then elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. But that would require adjacent OH groups, which could then eliminate to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on non-adjacent carbons, so their substitution would lead to 1,3-diol. Then, perhaps the diol undergoes elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but elimination typically requires adjacent leaving groups, which a diol doesn't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes an elimination reaction to form a carbene or something else, but that's getting into more complex territory.

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of a carbene, which then forms a ketone. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is subjected to a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons, which they're not in this case.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is not the right structure. Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon elimination, a double bond is formed, and then further reaction forms a ketone. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH induces a substitution to form a primary alcohol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how? That would require two substitutions, which is unlikely with KOH.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 2H at 4.79 ppm suggests a CH2 group in an environment that's deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. The 10H in the 2.41-2.23 range could be from CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps within the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

If the IR shows a carbonyl, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But that's not feasible because each substitution would require a good leaving group, but the ketone is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon elimination with KOH, two HBr molecules are removed, forming a double bond. But since the Brs are on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent in the structure, forming a double bond would require rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a bridge structure with a double bond.

But then, after elimination, product 1 would be a diene or an alkene. However, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps another reaction occurs. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide (product 1), and then the IR peak is due to the epoxide's C-O-C stretching. But I don't think epoxides have a strong carbonyl peak. Wait, the C-O-C in epoxides is around 1250 cm^-1, so that doesn't match 1720. So that can't be it.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the IR peak is from something else. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But how? That would require each Br to be replaced by a carbonyl group, which is unlikely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a coupling reaction to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a carbonyl formed via elimination. Let me imagine that elimination forms a double bond, and then some other reaction forms a ketone. But I'm not seeing the pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, and the IR peak isn't from a carbonyl but from something else. But that's conflicting with the IR data.

I'm still stuck on the first step. Maybe I should accept that product 1 is a ketone and move forward.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation, but if the substrate is a ketone, what reaction would occur? Maybe it's involved in an enolate formation or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via an acid-catalyzed dehydration. Alternatively, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, Al(OiPr)3 could induce some ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a geminal dihalide, which upon treatment with KOH forms a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it.

Wait, let's say product 1 is an epoxide. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, it could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the ring could open. But in such a case, the product would be an alcohol or a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enolate. Then, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond would break, forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → (elimination with KOH) → forms an enol ether or a ketone.

Wait, no, product 1 is the first product after KOH.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it rearranges or something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some rearrangement.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging. Let's proceed.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, perhaps between two carbons adjacent to a carbonyl group. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, producing two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl. Let's imagine a structure like R-CO-CH2-CHO. The protons on the CH2 next to the ketone would be deshielded. Each of those protons would be next to the carbonyl group and perhaps coupled to neighboring protons.

Assuming the structure is something like CH2(CO)-CH2-CO-R, but it's more likely a simpler structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and after ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes or ketones.

But given the starting material is adamantane-based, the product after ozonolysis would likely have a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, making a diketone.

Let's say product 2 is cyclohexene with a ketone substituent. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have protons next to the carbonyl, which would be deshielded.

In such a scenario, the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet. Wait, why a triplet? Because each H is coupled with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO, the CH2 group would have each H coupled with the adjacent CH2 and the CHO group. Hmm, but the exact splitting depends on the neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, the CH2 groups would each have neighboring Hs. The Hs on the CH2 next to CO would each have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the CH2 groups would each have neighboring Hs. The Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps it's a geminal diol after ozonolysis, but that's not likely as ozonolysis typically doesn't form that.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis produces a compound with a conjugated system, the splitting could be different.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupled with two Hs from another CH2 group. So each H would see two neighboring Hs, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is coupled with two Hs on adjacent groups, perhaps it's a triplet. Alternatively, if there's coupling with two different sets of Hs, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's think about a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an enone, like a conjugated dienone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, leading to a diketone. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones. Hmm, but the exact structure is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two carbonyls. So the structure would be O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two Hs. The Hs on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. So in the NMR, the most deshielded Hs (those next to the carbonyls) would be triplets.

Alternatively, if each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be coupled with two Hs, giving a triplet.

Wait, but the option given is a triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent group, it's a triplet. But if there are more couplings, like another set, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and another two from a different adjacent group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of doublets.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another angle: the most deshielded H is likely to be adjacent to a carbonyl group. If that H is in a CH2 group, and each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, under what coupling constants would that occur? For vicinal coupling (J ~ 6-8 Hz), each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, and so on.

So, perhaps the answer is a triplet (option A), but I'm not entirely sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) after ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm signal suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, consistent with a ketone structure.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is likely a ketone formed via elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or further reaction, forming product 2. Given the nature of Al(OiPr)₃, product 2 may involve the formation of a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group, creating an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone).

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS).  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would exhibit coupling with neighboring hydrogens, leading to a specific splitting pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.  
   - The coupling constant (J) for vicinal hydrogens (~6-8 Hz) supports this interpretation.

### Conclusion:  
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to work through it.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each step.

First, the first step: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism. This would form an alkene. So, the product 1 should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is in excess and heated, it's likely an elimination to form 1,3-cycloaddition or maybe a different structure. But wait, wait, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, right? Because in adamantane, the structure is diamond-like, so the positions are such that 1 and 3 are adjacent.

So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, I think. Or maybe between C1 and C3. Wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Because in E2, the H and Br are removed from adjacent carbons. Wait, no, E2 is between adjacent carbons. So if the bromines are on 1 and 3, but are they adjacent? Hmm, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is bonded to three others, forming a diamond lattice. So the positions 1 and 3 might be two bonds apart. So in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br are on carbons that are not adjacent. Then elimination would not be possible via E2 because the two leaving groups are on non-adjacent carbons. Wait, but maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if they're not adjacent, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe they're on adjacent positions in the adamantane structure. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and each carbon is connected in a way that's tetrahedral. So the 1 and 3 positions are diagonally opposite on a face, maybe not adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the bromines are on adjacent carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination, but maybe a substitution. Oh wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. Maybe it's undergoing a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would require adjacent leaving groups, which I don't think it has. So maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide or something else. Wait, but the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a region consistent with an alcohol or maybe an ether, but wait, another possibility is an epoxide. But wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Hmm, wait, perhaps it's an elimination forming an alkene, which upon reaction with KOH would give an epoxide? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the NMR data.

The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen atom, possibly an ether, or maybe an epoxide. Or maybe it's a diol. Wait, but the product is made by heating with KOH, which is a base. If product 1 has 2H at 4.79, perhaps it's an epoxide. Because epoxide protons tend to be around 3-4 ppm, but maybe in a more deshielded environment. Alternatively, another possibility is a geminal diol, but that's less likely. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides react with a base like KOH, they can form an alkene via elimination. However, if the base is in excess and the reaction is done under specific conditions, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a diol. But no, KOH is a base and a strong nucleophile; substitution would require a good leaving group. Wait, but the product after KOH is product 1, which has an IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong absorption, which could correspond to a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe the initial reaction is not elimination but oxidation. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution to form a diol. But wait, substitution with KOH would require two substitution steps, but that would form a diol. But then, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 doesn't fit a diol. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon heating with excess KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, forming an alkane with two adjacent hydroxyl groups. No, that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl peak. So perhaps product 1 is an ester or a ketone. So how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that usually involves ketones and introduces an oxygen. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution forming a ketone. But wait, that would require a good leaving group and the formation of a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to coupling. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, which could cause a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Then, in presence of more KOH, perhaps the alkene undergoes epoxidation. But KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation; that's more done with peracids.

Alternatively, maybe the initial product is an epoxide. So, if elimination forms an epoxide, the NMR would show a triplet or something else around 4 ppm. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the epoxide isn't the right product.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O. That would be an epoxide's structure. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. If the reaction forms a ketone, the IR would show a strong peak at around 1720 cm^-1, which matches the data. So how would a dihalide form a ketone with KOH?

Hmm, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then perhaps some further reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. Or maybe a nucleophilic substitution where the base removes the bromide, and then another substitution, but that would form a diol if the hydroxide attacks both carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a double substitution forming a diol. Let's think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with excess KOH. Each Br is replaced by OH, forming 1,3-diol. But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually broad around 3300 cm^-1. But the given IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the product is not a diol but a ketone. How? Well, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH, but then the structure rearranges. Wait, but that's stretching it. Alternatively, maybe elimination forms an alkene, and then the alkene undergoes some reaction to form a carbonyl. But under what conditions? Maybe ozonolysis, but that's a later step in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, and then maybe another reaction, but in the presence of KOH, perhaps it's more about elimination than addition. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Because when dihalides are treated with a base, especially in a specific way, they can form epoxides. Wait, but I thought epoxides form from alkenes with peracids. Oh wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a base, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of an epoxide. But I'm not entirely sure about that mechanism. Let me think: vicinal dihalides can form epoxides under certain conditions, like with a base. So maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, forms an epoxide. So product 1 would be adamantane epoxide.

In that case, the NMR would show the protons on the epoxide. Epoxide protons are typically deshielded and appear around 3.5-4.5 ppm, maybe as a triplet or another pattern. But in the given data, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H. That might correspond to the epoxide's CH2 group, but wait, epoxides are usually three-membered rings, so each carbon has two substituents. But in adamantane, the epoxide would be a bridge, perhaps. So the structure would have each oxygen connected to two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between two CH groups.

Wait, the NMR in product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a doublet. Wait, no, in the question, it's written as 4.79(2H), so probably a doublet or triplet. But without knowing the splitting, it's a bit hard.

But moving on, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I thought was a carbonyl. So maybe that's not an epoxide. Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a ketone, formed via elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ring. Let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form a ring. So in the adamantane structure, the elimination would form a bridge, leading to a bicyclic structure with a double bond.

But then, what would be the product? Maybe a bicyclo structure with a double bond, but how would that lead to a carbonyl in the IR?

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution, but that doesn't seem to fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a geminal diol, but that's unlikely because KOH isn't a strong enough acid for that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH is a ketone. So in the IR, 1720 cm^-1 is a ketone. So how would that form? Let's think of a possible mechanism. Maybe each bromide is replaced by a hydroxyl group, and then some kind of elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that would require a neighboring group effect, which might not be feasible in adamantane's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to a substitution where one Br is replaced by OH, and then another elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl. But that seems a bit forced.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the two Br atoms are replaced by an oxygen, leading to a ketone. Wait, but how? If two adjacent carbons each lose a Br and gain an O, that could form a carbonyl group. Let me imagine: if two CH2Br groups become CH(O) groups, but that would require the two oxygens to be adjacent, which would form a carbonyl. So perhaps the dihalide, upon treatment with KOH, forms a diketone? But that doesn't seem right because two carbonyls adjacent would likely form an enone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a single substitution. If one Br is replaced by OH, and the other by something else, but that's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the second step and see if that gives any clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in alkylation or acylation reactions. Alternatively, it's used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but I'm not sure what's happening here.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, then treating it with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might facilitate some kind of acylation or alkylation. But without knowing what product 1 is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, heating with Al(OiPr)3 might cause ring-opening. But under what conditions? Acidic conditions would open epoxides, but Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can act as a catalyst in such reactions.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the third step. Product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into fragments.

But wait, the third product's NMR is the target, and the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So let's think, after ozonolysis, we would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. The most deshielded proton would be near the carbonyl group.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups, and any protons near them would be deshielded.

Wait, but ozonolysis usually cleaves the double bond and forms carbonyl groups on each fragment. So if the starting material (product 2) has a double bond, product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds.

So, let me try to piece this together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with IR 1720 cm^-1, so ketone) via some reaction with KOH.

2. Product 1 → product 2 by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe AlCl3 is used in Friedel-Crafts, but perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, but perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, heating with Al(OiPr)3 could lead to some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and heating with Al(OiPr)3 leads to acid-catalyzed ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. But I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton, which is not exchanged (so not an -OH proton). So, in product 3, which is after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Let me think about ozonolysis. Suppose the double bond in product 2 is between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would cleave it, and each fragment would have a carbonyl group at the site of cleavage. So if the original alkene was symmetric, the ozonolysis product would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but the ozonolysis is done at -78°C, which is a low temperature, so it's likely controlled conditions, perhaps not leading to overoxidation. Also, the work-up is with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is a mild reductant, so it might prevent further oxidation and just break the ozonides into carbonyls.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR would show protons near these groups, which are deshielded.

Now, considering the coupling patterns. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The splitting would depend on the neighboring protons.

For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps each proton in the CH2 would couple with the neighboring group.

But wait, let's think about a specific structure. Suppose product 2 has a trans double bond, and after ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. Let's say each fragment has a structure like R-CO-CH2-CHO. Wait, no. Alternatively, each fragment might have a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two separate carbonyl compounds. But without knowing the exact structure of product 2, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about each step and possible structures.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

Given the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

So, how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH? One possibility is that each Br is replaced by an OH group, and then elimination occurs to form a carbonyl. But that would require adjacent OH groups, which could then eliminate to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on non-adjacent carbons, so their substitution would lead to 1,3-diol. Then, perhaps the diol undergoes elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but elimination typically requires adjacent leaving groups, which a diol doesn't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes an elimination reaction to form a carbene or something else, but that's getting into more complex territory.

Wait, another possibility: the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to the formation of a carbene, which then forms a ketone. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is subjected to a double dehydrohalogenation, but that would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons, which they're not in this case.

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is not the right structure. Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon elimination, a double bond is formed, and then further reaction forms a ketone. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH induces a substitution to form a primary alcohol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how? That would require two substitutions, which is unlikely with KOH.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 2H at 4.79 ppm suggests a CH2 group in an environment that's deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. The 10H in the 2.41-2.23 range could be from CH2 groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps within the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

If the IR shows a carbonyl, product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps each Br is replaced by a ketone group. But that's not feasible because each substitution would require a good leaving group, but the ketone is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Upon elimination with KOH, two HBr molecules are removed, forming a double bond. But since the Brs are on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent in the structure, forming a double bond would require rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a bridge structure with a double bond.

But then, after elimination, product 1 would be a diene or an alkene. However, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps another reaction occurs. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide (product 1), and then the IR peak is due to the epoxide's C-O-C stretching. But I don't think epoxides have a strong carbonyl peak. Wait, the C-O-C in epoxides is around 1250 cm^-1, so that doesn't match 1720. So that can't be it.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a diol, and the IR peak is from something else. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But how? That would require each Br to be replaced by a carbonyl group, which is unlikely with KOH.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a coupling reaction to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product is a carbonyl formed via elimination. Let me imagine that elimination forms a double bond, and then some other reaction forms a ketone. But I'm not seeing the pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, and the IR peak isn't from a carbonyl but from something else. But that's conflicting with the IR data.

I'm still stuck on the first step. Maybe I should accept that product 1 is a ketone and move forward.

So, product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation, but if the substrate is a ketone, what reaction would occur? Maybe it's involved in an enolate formation or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via an acid-catalyzed dehydration. Alternatively, if product 1 is a cyclic ketone, Al(OiPr)3 could induce some ring-opening or rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a geminal dihalide, which upon treatment with KOH forms a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to open it.

Wait, let's say product 1 is an epoxide. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, it could protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the ring could open. But in such a case, the product would be an alcohol or a diol, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Hmm, maybe product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enolate. Then, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond would break, forming two carbonyl groups.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me outline:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → (elimination with KOH) → forms an enol ether or a ketone.

Wait, no, product 1 is the first product after KOH.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it rearranges or something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed via some rearrangement.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging. Let's proceed.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, perhaps between two carbons adjacent to a carbonyl group. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, producing two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be near a carbonyl. Let's imagine a structure like R-CO-CH2-CHO. The protons on the CH2 next to the ketone would be deshielded. Each of those protons would be next to the carbonyl group and perhaps coupled to neighboring protons.

Assuming the structure is something like CH2(CO)-CH2-CO-R, but it's more likely a simpler structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and after ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes or ketones.

But given the starting material is adamantane-based, the product after ozonolysis would likely have a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic ketone with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, making a diketone.

Let's say product 2 is cyclohexene with a ketone substituent. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, giving two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have protons next to the carbonyl, which would be deshielded.

In such a scenario, the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be a triplet. Wait, why a triplet? Because each H is coupled with two neighboring Hs.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CHO, the CH2 group would have each H coupled with the adjacent CH2 and the CHO group. Hmm, but the exact splitting depends on the neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, the CH2 groups would each have neighboring Hs. The Hs on the CH2 next to CO would each have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O, then the CH2 groups would each have neighboring Hs. The Hs on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, perhaps it's a geminal diol after ozonolysis, but that's not likely as ozonolysis typically doesn't form that.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis produces a compound with a conjugated system, the splitting could be different.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H in that CH2 is coupled with two Hs from another CH2 group. So each H would see two neighboring Hs, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is coupled with two Hs on adjacent groups, perhaps it's a triplet. Alternatively, if there's coupling with two different sets of Hs, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let's think about a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an enone, like a conjugated dienone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, leading to a diketone. For example, if product 2 is cyclohexenone, ozonolysis would break it into two ketones. Hmm, but the exact structure is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two carbonyls. So the structure would be O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O. The CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two Hs. The Hs on each CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2's Hs, leading to a triplet for each.

But wait, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet. So in the NMR, the most deshielded Hs (those next to the carbonyls) would be triplets.

Alternatively, if each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be coupled with two Hs, giving a triplet.

Wait, but the option given is a triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent group, it's a triplet. But if there are more couplings, like another set, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and another two from a different adjacent group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is coupled with two Hs on one side and one H on the other, leading to a triplet of doublets.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Another angle: the most deshielded H is likely to be adjacent to a carbonyl group. If that H is in a CH2 group, and each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, under what coupling constants would that occur? For vicinal coupling (J ~ 6-8 Hz), each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, and so on.

So, perhaps the answer is a triplet (option A), but I'm not entirely sure.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) after ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm signal suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, consistent with a ketone structure.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is likely a ketone formed via elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Aluminum Isopropoxide**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates a rearrangement or further reaction, forming product 2. Given the nature of Al(OiPr)₃, product 2 may involve the formation of a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group, creating an enone (α,β-unsaturated ketone).

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS).  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3, which contains carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would exhibit coupling with neighboring hydrogens, leading to a specific splitting pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern.  
   - The coupling constant (J) for vicinal hydrogens (~6-8 Hz) supports this interpretation.

### Conclusion:  
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

ANSWER: A
