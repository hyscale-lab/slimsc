Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, they turn off that field and turn on another one pointing in the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which affects its spin direction. The energy levels of the spin in a magnetic field are quantized, leading to transitions when the field changes.

Wait, the particle is spin-1/2, so its spin can be either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 along any chosen axis. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma multiplied by Sz, where Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = gamma * Sz.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. Since the magnetic moment is aligned with B, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz. The energy of the system is given by E = -mu · B. So in this initial state, the particle has a definite Sz value.

But when the field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along +Y, the situation changes. I think this is a problem involving the time evolution of a quantum state when the Hamiltonian changes.

Wait, so the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y, right? Because the energy now depends on the spin component along Y: E = - mu · B, which would be -gamma * S_y * B.

So the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Since S_y and Sz don't commute, the initial state is not an eigenstate of H. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz>.

To find the oscillation frequency, I think we need to find the time dependence of <Sz>. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between the states, which in quantum mechanics is E = ħω, so ω = E/ħ.

Wait, let me think again. The time evolution of the expectation value can be found using the time-dependent perturbation theory or by solving the Schrödinger equation. But perhaps a simpler approach is to note that when the system is subjected to a Hamiltonian proportional to S_y, the spin precesses around the Y-axis, causing the expectation values of the spin components to oscillate.

The time evolution of the expectation value of Sz can be found by considering the transition probabilities between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

Let me model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2.

The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because energy is E = -mu · B, so H = -mu_y B = -gamma S_y B.

Wait, no, let's get that right. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is E = -mu · B. Since B is along Y, E = -gamma S_y B.

So H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, S_y is an operator, so H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of H will be the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>.

The initial state is |+z>. So we can express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

I remember that the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think. The standard expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

No, wait: actually, if I'm not mistaken, the correct expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think about the rotation. To get from Sz to Sy, you rotate around the x-axis by 90 degrees.

The rotation operator is R_x(theta) = exp(-i theta S_x / ħ). For theta = pi/2, R_x(pi/2) would take Sz to Sy.

The matrix for R_x(pi/2) is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying this to |+z>, which is [1; 0], gives [0; i], which is i|−z>.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write the matrices.

The spin-up state in Sz basis is |+z> = (1, 0)^T.

The rotation matrix R_x(theta) is:

[cos(theta/2) -i sin(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)],
[i sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), cos(theta/2) + i sin(theta/2)]

Wait, no, the correct rotation matrix for spin-1/2 is:

R_x(theta) = [[cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2)],
              [-i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2)]]

So for theta = pi/2,

cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707.

So R_x(pi/2) is:

[ sqrt(2)/2 , -i sqrt(2)/2 ]
[ -i sqrt(2)/2 , sqrt(2)/2 ]

So when we apply R_x(pi/2) to |+z> = [1; 0], we get:

( sqrt(2)/2 , -i sqrt(2)/2 )^T.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -i)^T.

So the state becomes (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) = |+y> ?

Wait, no, because the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>. The rotation takes |+z> into |+y>?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

So when we apply R_x(pi/2) to |+z>, we get (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2), which is |-y>, right?

Wait, no, because when you rotate around x by 90 degrees, you take z to y, but I'm getting confused about the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state |+z> is expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute it.

We have |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
and |-y> = (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2).

Adding |+y> and |-y> gives (|+z> + i|−z> + |+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) )= (2|+z>)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Hmm, that's correct.

So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B)( ħ/2 ), and E_- = (-gamma B)( -ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ /2.

Wait, because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> ?

Wait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Thus, H |+y> = (-gamma B) (S_y |+y> ) = (-gamma B) ( (ħ/2) |+y> ) = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (- ħ/2 ) |−y> = (gamma B ħ/2) |−y>.

Wait, but wait, the actual energy would be E = -mu · B. So mu = gamma S, so mu · B (along Y) is gamma S_y B. So the energy is -gamma S_y B. Hence H = -gamma B S_y.

So, the energies are E_+y = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_-y = (-gamma B) (-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ /2.

Now, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = (|+y> e^{-i E_+ y t/ħ} + |-y> e^{-i E_- y t/ħ}) ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+y and E_-y:

E_+y = (- gamma B ħ ) / 2
E_-y = (gamma B ħ ) / 2

So the exponents become:

e^{-i (- gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } = e^{i gamma B t / 2 }

And for E_-y:

e^{-i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } = e^{-i gamma B t / 2 }

So the state becomes:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t / 2 } + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we want to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = gamma^{-1} <mu_z>.

Wait, no, mu_z is gamma * Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

But the question asks about the oscillation of the average z-component, so <Sz>.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.

Compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as the sum:

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Wait, no, correction: because in the exponents, the time terms are:

E_+y: (-gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ = - gamma B t / 2, so e^{-i E_+ y t/ħ} = e^{i gamma B t/2 }

Similarly, E_-y: (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ = gamma B t/2, so e^{-i gamma B t/2 }

So |ψ(t)> is:

[ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Now, let me express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

Substituting these into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t/2 } 
           + (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Multiply through:

= [ (|+z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + i|−z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } 
    + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } − i|−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) 
    / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

So the denominator becomes sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.

So:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) 
          + i|−z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So:

= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) 
    + i|−z> (2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2

Simplify each term:

For the |+z> term: 2 cos(...) / 2 = cos(...)

For the |−z> term: i * 2i sin(...) /2 = (i^2) * (2 sin(...))/2 = (-1) sin(...)

So:

|ψ(t)> = [ cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - sin(gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ] / 1

So, |ψ(t)> = cos( (gamma B/2 ) t ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B/2 ) t ) |−z>

Now, the expectation value <Sz> is:

< Sz > = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) >

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

Compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>:

= [ cos^2( (gamma B/2 ) t ) * (ħ/2) ) 
    + sin^2( (gamma B/2 ) t ) * (-ħ/2) ) ]

= ħ/2 [ cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) ] where x = (gamma B/2 ) t.

Using double-angle identity: cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x)

So:

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos( 2x ) 
= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, because 2x = gamma B t.

So <Sz> oscillates as cos(gamma B t). The angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, divided by 2π.

Wait, the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. So the frequency f = omega/(2pi) is gamma B/(2pi). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega (angular frequency) in the expression cos(omega t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options are in terms of gamma B. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) gamma*B/2
B) gamma*B
C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B
D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait. My calculation above gives <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation occurs with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is (angular frequency), so the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but hold on. Because in the time evolution, the phase factors come from the energy differences. Let me think again. The transition frequency between the |+y> and |-y> states is determined by their energy difference.

The energy levels are E_+y = (-gamma B ħ/2 ), E_-y = (gamma B ħ/2 )

The difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency omega is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but looking back, when I computed <Sz>, I found it oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, another approach: the average spin component in z direction is the expectation value. So when the state is expressed as |psi(t)>, the expectation value <Sz> will oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy splitting.

The energy difference between the two states is 2*(gamma B ħ /2) )= gamma B ħ.

So the time period would be T = 2pi / (gamma B).

So the frequency is f = 1/T = gamma B/(2pi), but the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency. The average <Sz> oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.

So the correct answer is B) gamma*B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, $|+z\rangle$, with eigenvalue $\hbar/2$. This is also an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle = (|+z\rangle + i|{-z}\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ and $|-y\rangle = (|+z\rangle - i|{-z}\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$.

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{-iE_{+y}t/\hbar} + |-y\rangle e^{-iE_{-y}t/\hbar} \right),
   \]
   where $E_{+y} = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_{-y} = \gamma B \hbar / 2$.

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: Substituting the time-dependent state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, the expectation value oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$.

5. **Energy Splitting**: The energy difference between the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ states is $\Delta E = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = \gamma B \hbar$. The angular frequency of oscillation is then $\omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The setup is that the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, they turn off that field and turn on another one pointing in the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which affects its spin direction. The energy levels of the spin in a magnetic field are quantized, leading to transitions when the field changes.

Wait, the particle is spin-1/2, so its spin can be either +ħ/2 or -ħ/2 along any chosen axis. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma multiplied by Sz, where Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = gamma * Sz.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. Since the magnetic moment is aligned with B, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz. The energy of the system is given by E = -mu · B. So in this initial state, the particle has a definite Sz value.

But when the field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along +Y, the situation changes. I think this is a problem involving the time evolution of a quantum state when the Hamiltonian changes.

Wait, so the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y, right? Because the energy now depends on the spin component along Y: E = - mu · B, which would be -gamma * S_y * B.

So the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Since S_y and Sz don't commute, the initial state is not an eigenstate of H. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz>.

To find the oscillation frequency, I think we need to find the time dependence of <Sz>. The expectation value of Sz will oscillate with a frequency related to the energy difference between the states, which in quantum mechanics is E = ħω, so ω = E/ħ.

Wait, let me think again. The time evolution of the expectation value can be found using the time-dependent perturbation theory or by solving the Schrödinger equation. But perhaps a simpler approach is to note that when the system is subjected to a Hamiltonian proportional to S_y, the spin precesses around the Y-axis, causing the expectation values of the spin components to oscillate.

The time evolution of the expectation value of Sz can be found by considering the transition probabilities between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

Let me model this. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2.

The new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because energy is E = -mu · B, so H = -mu_y B = -gamma S_y B.

Wait, no, let's get that right. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S. So the energy is E = -mu · B. Since B is along Y, E = -gamma S_y B.

So H = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, S_y is an operator, so H is proportional to S_y. The eigenstates of H will be the eigenstates of S_y, which are |+y> and |-y>.

The initial state is |+z>. So we can express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

I remember that the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think. The standard expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

No, wait: actually, if I'm not mistaken, the correct expressions are:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think about the rotation. To get from Sz to Sy, you rotate around the x-axis by 90 degrees.

The rotation operator is R_x(theta) = exp(-i theta S_x / ħ). For theta = pi/2, R_x(pi/2) would take Sz to Sy.

The matrix for R_x(pi/2) is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Applying this to |+z>, which is [1; 0], gives [0; i], which is i|−z>.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me write the matrices.

The spin-up state in Sz basis is |+z> = (1, 0)^T.

The rotation matrix R_x(theta) is:

[cos(theta/2) -i sin(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)],
[i sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), cos(theta/2) + i sin(theta/2)]

Wait, no, the correct rotation matrix for spin-1/2 is:

R_x(theta) = [[cos(theta/2), -i sin(theta/2)],
              [-i sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2)]]

So for theta = pi/2,

cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707.

So R_x(pi/2) is:

[ sqrt(2)/2 , -i sqrt(2)/2 ]
[ -i sqrt(2)/2 , sqrt(2)/2 ]

So when we apply R_x(pi/2) to |+z> = [1; 0], we get:

( sqrt(2)/2 , -i sqrt(2)/2 )^T.

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -i)^T.

So the state becomes (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) = |+y> ?

Wait, no, because the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>. The rotation takes |+z> into |+y>?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

So when we apply R_x(pi/2) to |+z>, we get (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2), which is |-y>, right?

Wait, no, because when you rotate around x by 90 degrees, you take z to y, but I'm getting confused about the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state |+z> is expressed as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2) ?

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute it.

We have |+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
and |-y> = (|+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2).

Adding |+y> and |-y> gives (|+z> + i|−z> + |+z> - i|−z>)/sqrt(2) )= (2|+z>)/sqrt(2) )= sqrt(2) |+z>.

So |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Hmm, that's correct.

So the initial state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y. Since H is proportional to S_y, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B)( ħ/2 ), and E_- = (-gamma B)( -ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ /2.

Wait, because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y> ?

Wait, no. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H = - gamma B S_y.

Thus, H |+y> = (-gamma B) (S_y |+y> ) = (-gamma B) ( (ħ/2) |+y> ) = (-gamma B ħ/2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, H |-y> = (-gamma B) (- ħ/2 ) |−y> = (gamma B ħ/2) |−y>.

Wait, but wait, the actual energy would be E = -mu · B. So mu = gamma S, so mu · B (along Y) is gamma S_y B. So the energy is -gamma S_y B. Hence H = -gamma B S_y.

So, the energies are E_+y = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_-y = (-gamma B) (-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ /2.

Now, the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = (|+y> e^{-i E_+ y t/ħ} + |-y> e^{-i E_- y t/ħ}) ) / sqrt(2).

Substituting E_+y and E_-y:

E_+y = (- gamma B ħ ) / 2
E_-y = (gamma B ħ ) / 2

So the exponents become:

e^{-i (- gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } = e^{i gamma B t / 2 }

And for E_-y:

e^{-i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } = e^{-i gamma B t / 2 }

So the state becomes:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t / 2 } + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we want to compute the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = gamma^{-1} <mu_z>.

Wait, no, mu_z is gamma * Sz, so <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

But the question asks about the oscillation of the average z-component, so <Sz>.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute <Sz> directly.

Compute <Sz> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>.

Let me write |ψ(t)> as the sum:

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i theta} |+y> + e^{-i theta} |-y> ] / sqrt(2), where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Wait, no, correction: because in the exponents, the time terms are:

E_+y: (-gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ = - gamma B t / 2, so e^{-i E_+ y t/ħ} = e^{i gamma B t/2 }

Similarly, E_-y: (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ = gamma B t/2, so e^{-i gamma B t/2 }

So |ψ(t)> is:

[ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Now, let me express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2)

Substituting these into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ (|+z> + i|−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t/2 } 
           + (|+z> − i|−z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Multiply through:

= [ (|+z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + i|−z> e^{i gamma B t/2 } 
    + |+z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } − i|−z> e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) 
    / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

So the denominator becomes sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.

So:

|ψ(t)> = [ |+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) 
          + i|−z> (e^{i gamma B t/2 } - e^{-i gamma B t/2 }) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So:

= [ |+z> (2 cos(gamma B t/2 )) 
    + i|−z> (2i sin(gamma B t/2 )) ] / 2

Simplify each term:

For the |+z> term: 2 cos(...) / 2 = cos(...)

For the |−z> term: i * 2i sin(...) /2 = (i^2) * (2 sin(...))/2 = (-1) sin(...)

So:

|ψ(t)> = [ cos(gamma B t/2 ) |+z> - sin(gamma B t/2 ) |−z> ] / 1

So, |ψ(t)> = cos( (gamma B/2 ) t ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B/2 ) t ) |−z>

Now, the expectation value <Sz> is:

< Sz > = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t) >

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

Compute <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>:

= [ cos^2( (gamma B/2 ) t ) * (ħ/2) ) 
    + sin^2( (gamma B/2 ) t ) * (-ħ/2) ) ]

= ħ/2 [ cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) ] where x = (gamma B/2 ) t.

Using double-angle identity: cos^2(x) - sin^2(x) = cos(2x)

So:

< Sz > = (ħ/2) cos( 2x ) 
= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, because 2x = gamma B t.

So <Sz> oscillates as cos(gamma B t). The angular frequency is gamma B, so the oscillation frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient of t in the cosine argument, divided by 2π.

Wait, the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. So the frequency f = omega/(2pi) is gamma B/(2pi). But the question is about the oscillation frequency, which is omega (angular frequency) in the expression cos(omega t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options are in terms of gamma B. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) gamma*B/2
B) gamma*B
C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B
D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait. My calculation above gives <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation occurs with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

The question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is (angular frequency), so the answer would be gamma B, which is option B.

Wait, but hold on. Because in the time evolution, the phase factors come from the energy differences. Let me think again. The transition frequency between the |+y> and |-y> states is determined by their energy difference.

The energy levels are E_+y = (-gamma B ħ/2 ), E_-y = (gamma B ħ/2 )

The difference is E_-y - E_+y = gamma B ħ.

The angular frequency omega is (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So yes, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but looking back, when I computed <Sz>, I found it oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, another approach: the average spin component in z direction is the expectation value. So when the state is expressed as |psi(t)>, the expectation value <Sz> will oscillate with a frequency determined by the energy splitting.

The energy difference between the two states is 2*(gamma B ħ /2) )= gamma B ħ.

So the time period would be T = 2pi / (gamma B).

So the frequency is f = 1/T = gamma B/(2pi), but the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency. The average <Sz> oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.

So the correct answer is B) gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction, with the same magnitude $B$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, $|+z\rangle$, with eigenvalue $\hbar/2$. This is also an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_z$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the $+y$ direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle = (|+z\rangle + i|{-z}\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ and $|-y\rangle = (|+z\rangle - i|{-z}\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$.

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$:  
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{-iE_{+y}t/\hbar} + |-y\rangle e^{-iE_{-y}t/\hbar} \right),
   \]
   where $E_{+y} = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_{-y} = \gamma B \hbar / 2$.

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: Substituting the time-dependent state into $\langle S_z \rangle$, the expectation value oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   The oscillation frequency is determined by the angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$.

5. **Energy Splitting**: The energy difference between the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ states is $\Delta E = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = \gamma B \hbar$. The angular frequency of oscillation is then $\omega = \Delta E / \hbar = \gamma B$.

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. This corresponds to **Option B**.
