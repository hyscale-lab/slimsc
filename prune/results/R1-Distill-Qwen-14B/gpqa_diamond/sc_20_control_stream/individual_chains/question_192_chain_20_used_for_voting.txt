Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to process it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. So, the conductor itself is neutral to start with. Inside the cavity, there's a small amount of positive charge +q. Now, the setup is that the conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has a radius r, with r being less than R. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, imagine the conductor is a big sphere, and inside it, a little off-center, there's a smaller sphere-shaped cavity.

The point P in question is outside the conductor, at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The point P's distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. Hmm, so the geometry here is a bit tricky. I think I should visualize this. The point P is somewhere outside, and the centers of the conductor and the cavity are s units apart. 

The question is asking for the electric field E at point P. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

So, thinking about electrostatics and conductors. I remember that in conductors, the charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor is neutral initially, after placing the charge +q inside the cavity, something happens. Wait, but the conductor was uncharged, and the cavity has +q. So, what does that do?

Wait, right! When you have a conductor with a cavity and place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So, the inner surface will have -q. But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out.

So, the conductor's inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q. But wait, the conductor is neutral overall. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the total charge zero. Oh, right, because the conductor started with zero charge. So that's correct.

Now, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, the field should be the same as if all the charge on the conductor were concentrated at its center. Because for a spherical conductor, the external field is as if the charges are at the center. But wait, in this case, the conductor has a total charge of zero, but the outer surface has +q. No, wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q. So the total charge is zero because -q + q = 0.

Wait, if that's the case, then the outer surface has +q. So, the electric field outside the conductor due to the conductor's charges would be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because when you're outside a spherical shell, the field is like a point charge at the center. So, the field outside the conductor would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²), since L is the distance from the center of the conductor (which is where the charge is considered to be).

Wait, but wait. The initial setup says that the conductor is uncharged, and a charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. Hmm, yes. So, the net charge on the conductor is zero. So, the outer surface has +q, so when considering the external field, it's as if that charge is at the center. So the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor, would be due to the +q on the outer surface.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, but the point P is L distance from the center of the conductor. So yes, E would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²).

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So would the answer be B?

Wait, but wait another thing. The point P's position relative to the cavity's center is l, and the angle is theta. Does that affect the electric field outside the conductor?

Hmm. Because the field outside a conductor is only due to the charges on the outer surface, and for a spherical conductor, the outer surface behaves as if all its charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor has a cavity which is not centered at the conductor's center. So, the inner surface has -q, but the outer surface has +q. So the outer surface's charge distribution would adjust due to the presence of the inner -q charge. But in that case, would the outer surface's charge distribution be symmetric?

Wait, no. The inner surface's charge is -q and is not at the center of the conductor. So the inner surface is a non-spherical cavity, but wait, the conductor's inner surface is a sphere? No, wait, the conductor is a spherical shell. So the inner surface is a sphere of radius R, and the cavity is a smaller sphere within it.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. The conductor is a solid sphere, but no, it's a spherical conductor, perhaps a shell. Wait, the question says it's a spherical conductor with a cavity. So, I think it's a conducting shell with a cavity inside. So, it's a hollow sphere, a shell, with a cavity inside it. So, the conductor is a shell, radius R, and the cavity is a smaller sphere at a distance s from the center.

So, when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner surface) will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. Because the conductor was initially neutral.

So the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, and it's symmetric, right? No, wait, no. The inner surface has -q, which is not at the center of the conductor because the cavity is shifted by s.

Wait, in reality, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge distribution that's not uniform because the cavity is off-center. So, the inner surface's charge will be induced in such a way to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But the outer surface's charge will be uniform if the conductor is a sphere, regardless of the inner cavity's position.

Wait, no, wait again. The conductor is a spherical shell, so the outer surface must be symmetric because the external field doesn't know about the inner cavity. So, the outer surface charge will distribute uniformly, regardless of s and the position of the inner cavity. Because the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So, the electric field outside the conductor at any point would be as if the +q is at the center. So, the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, I'm not sure. The field at point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's induced charges should be the only thing contributing. But if the conductor's outer surface is +q, then the field would be as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the point P's position is relative to the cavity's center as l and theta. So maybe that affects the field.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using the concept of image charges or the method of images, but I'm not sure.

Wait, think of the conductor as a spherical shell. The presence of the +q charge inside the cavity induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But the conductor itself is neutral, so it must have a +q on the outer surface.

Now, considering the electric field outside the conductor: the field is due to the charge on the outer surface, which is +q located at the center of the conductor. So, the field at P is just as if that +q were there. So the formula would be k*q / L², where k is 1/(4πε₀).

So, looking at the options, option B says exactly that: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

But wait, what about the position of the cavity and the point P's position relative to the cavity's center? So, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, which is s away from the conductor's center. So, would that affect the calculation?

Hmm. Let me think again. The field outside the conductor is due to the +q on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is a sphere, the field outside depends only on the charge and the distance from the center. Because the outer surface is a sphere, any charge distribution on it will produce a field as if the charge were concentrated at the center.

So, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So, the field should depend only on L, not on l or theta.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it another way. The field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. The field in the cavity is due to the +q and the induced -q on the inner surface. But outside the conductor, the field is due to the +q on the outer surface.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach it using Gauss's Law.

Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a Gaussian surface is Q_enc / ε₀.

Consider a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius larger than R). The enclosed charge is the +q on the outer surface. So the flux is (q) / ε₀. So the electric field at radius L would be E * 4πL² = q / ε₀ → E = q/(4πε₀ L²).

So this supports option B.

So the other options seem incorrect because:

Option A: (l - s cosθ)^2 in the denominator. But l is the distance from the cavity's center to P, but since the conductor is outside, it's the conductor's charge that matters, not the cavity's.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2. Again, seems to relate to the position of the cavity, but the field outside doesn't depend on that.

Option D: 1/(l²), which would be the case if the charge were at the cavity's center. But the charge is +q in the cavity, but the conductor's induced charges create a field outside, which is due to the conductor's outer charge, not the cavity's.

Wait, no. The conductor's outer charge is +q, so the field outside is due to that. So the presence of the cavity's charge inside doesn't affect the external field beyond inducing the conductor's charges.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B: E = (1/(4 π ε₀)) q / L².

The problem involves a neutral spherical conductor with a cavity of radius $r$ inside it, where the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (adjacent to the cavity) will have an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor will then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from the center. For a spherical conductor, the field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the $+q$ charge on the outer surface of the conductor.

3. **Gauss's Law**: Using Gauss's Law, the electric flux through a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius $L$) is proportional to the enclosed charge $+q$. This gives:
   \[
   E \cdot 4\pi L^2 = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} \implies E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of $l$, $s$, and $\theta$**: The distances $l$ and $s$, as well as the angle $\theta$, do not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field depends only on the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ suggests a dependence on the cavity's geometry, which is irrelevant for the external field.
- **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, which depends only on $q$ and $L$.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The denominator $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ also introduces an unnecessary dependence on the cavity's geometry.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. This would imply the field depends on $l$, which is the distance from the cavity's center, rather than the conductor's center.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is given by:
\[
E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]
