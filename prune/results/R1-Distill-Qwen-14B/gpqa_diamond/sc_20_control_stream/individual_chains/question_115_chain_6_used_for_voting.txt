Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are measured to be the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right direction. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, the problem involves relativistic particles colliding and producing photons. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, like an electron and a positron, they produce gamma rays (photons). Since they are moving towards each other, their rest frames might be relevant here. Also, because the photons have the same energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction? Or wait, no, because in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero.

Wait, but in this case, both are moving along the same axis. So their initial momenta must be considered.

Let me think about the initial setup. The electron is moving from the left, so to the right, along the horizontal axis. Its Lorentz factor is 4. The positron is moving from the right, so also to the left (since it's moving along the same axis). Its Lorentz factor is 2.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So from the right, meaning it's moving towards the left? Because if you're on the right side, moving along the horizontal axis, your direction is towards the left. So the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left.

So their velocities are opposite. So I should calculate their momenta.

The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So for each particle, their momentum is gamma * m * v. But since the electron and positron have the same mass, but different gammas and velocities.

Wait, but the electron and positron have the same rest mass, but different velocities. Right.

So, let me denote the electron as particle A and positron as particle B.

Electron (A): moving to the right (positive x-direction), gamma =4.

Positron (B): moving to the left (negative x-direction), gamma =2.

So their momenta are:

p_A = gamma_A * m_e * v_A (in +x direction)
p_B = gamma_B * m_e * v_B (in -x direction)

But wait, since the positron is moving from the right to the left, its velocity is negative. So p_B would be negative.

But perhaps I should calculate the total momentum before annihilation. Because in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, which might help when considering the photons.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the total momentum is not zero. So to find the energies of the photons, I need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum.

But wait, in the problem statement, the photons have the same energy. So their energies are E1 = E2.

And their directions are in upper-right and lower-right, meaning both are moving to the right but in different vertical directions. So their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Wait, but why are they in the upper-right and lower-right directions? That suggests they are moving at some angle above and below the x-axis, both in the right direction.

So, the two photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum (since E=pc for photons), but different directions.

Hmm. So let's think about this in terms of conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, the electron and positron are moving along the x-axis. Their total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies, and their total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

After annihilation, the two photons' energies and momenta must match this.

So, let's compute the initial total energy and momentum.

But since the electron and positron have opposite directions, their momenta may not cancel. Let's compute that.

Wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So its momentum is to the left (negative x). The electron is moving to the right (positive x).

So let's compute their energies and momenta.

For the electron (A):

gamma_A =4, m_e is the electron mass.

E_A = gamma_A * m_e c² =4 m_e c²

p_A = gamma_A * m_e v_A.

But v_A can be found from gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)). So let's solve for v_A.

gamma =4.

So,

gamma² = 16 = 1/(1 - v²/c²)

1 - v²/c² = 1/16
v²/c² = 15/16
v_A = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4 ≈ 0.968 c

Similarly, for the positron (B), gamma_B =2.

E_B = gamma_B * m_e c² = 2 m_e c²

p_B = gamma_B * m_e v_B.

v_B is the speed of the positron.

gamma =2.

gamma² =4=1/(1 - v_B²/c²)

1 - v_B²/c² = 1/4
v_B²/c² = 3/4
v_B = c * sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866 c

But since the positron is moving to the left, v_B is negative. So its momentum is p_B = gamma_B * m_e * v_B = 2 m_e c (sqrt(3)/2) ) * (-1) = - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, let me calculate the exact values.

Wait, for the positron, since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative.

So, v_B = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

Therefore, p_B = gamma_B * m_e * v_B = 2 * m_e * (- sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Similarly, the electron's velocity is + sqrt(15)/4 c, since moving to the right.

p_A = gamma_A * m_e * v_A = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c sqrt(15).

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_A + p_B = (sqrt(15) m_e c) + (- sqrt(3) m_e c) ) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The total initial energy is E_initial = E_A + E_B = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Let's denote them as photon 1 and photon 2.

Each photon has energy E, so E1 = E2 = E.

Their momenta are p1 and p2. Since photons have E=pc, the magnitude of their momenta is E/c.

But their directions are in upper-right and lower-right, so their momentum vectors have x and y components.

Let me denote the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis as theta and -theta, respectively. Because they're symmetric about the x-axis.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, which suggests that both photons are moving to the right, with one having a positive y component and the other a negative y component. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis. So the angle between them would be 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the x-axis.

Wait, no. Because the upper-right is, say, angle theta above the x-axis, and lower-right is theta below, so the angle between them would be 2 theta.

But in this case, the question is, what's the angle between the two photon directions. So if one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between them is 2 theta.

So, let's model this.

Photon 1: direction makes angle theta above x-axis.

Photon 2: direction makes angle theta below x-axis.

Each has momentum magnitude |p|=E/c.

So, for photon 1, momentum components:

p1x = (E/c) cos(theta)
p1y = (E/c) sin(theta)

Photon 2:

p2x = (E/c) cos(theta)
p2y = -(E/c) sin(theta)

So, the total momentum after annihilation is the sum of p1 and p2.

Total px: p1x + p2x = (E/c)(cos(theta) + cos(theta)) = 2 (E/c) cos(theta)
Total py: p1y + p2y = (E/c)(sin(theta) - sin(theta)) )= 0.

But according to conservation of momentum, the total px after must equal initial px.

Initial px was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Multiplying both sides by c:

2 E cos(theta) = m_e c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, what about the energy? The total energy after is the sum of the photons' energies: E + E = 2E.

Conservation of energy says that the initial energy (6 m_e c²) must equal 2E.

So,

2E =6 m_e c² → E=3 m_e c².

So, substituting E=3 m_e c² into the previous equation,

2 * 3 m_e c² * cos(theta) = m_e c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

6 m_e c² cos(theta) = m_e c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c²:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6.

Hmm. Let's compute the value of this.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is approx 1.732.

So numerator is 3.872 - 1.732 = 2.14.

Divide by 6: 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.3567 → theta ≈ arccos(0.3567).

What's arccos(0.3567)? Let's think. Cos(60 degrees)=0.5, cos(70)= ~0.342, so 0.3567 is about 70 degrees.

Wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.

Cos(70 degrees)= approx 0.3420.

0.3567 is a bit higher, so maybe 69 degrees.

But let me compute:

cos(theta)=0.3567.

Using calculator steps:

Let me compute theta in degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute using exact expressions.

But maybe I can find an exact value.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(15) and sqrt(3):

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983
sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872983 -1.7320508 ≈ 2.140932.

Divide by 6: 2.140932 /6 ≈ 0.356822.

So cos(theta)=0.356822.

What angle has cosine 0.356822?

We can compute it as arccos(0.356822). Let me think in terms of known angles.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a known angle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps I can calculate theta:

theta = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 )

But to find the angle between the photons, it's 2 theta.

So, if theta is approximately 69 degrees, then 2 theta is about 138 degrees.

Wait, that would make the angle between the two photons 138 degrees. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

A)74

B)172

C)138

D)96

So 138 is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the setup.

So, the initial setup:

Electron (gamma=4) moving right, positron (gamma=2) moving left.

We calculated that the total initial momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Then, after the collision, the photons have equal energy, so their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in y-components.

Wait, but the photons have the same energy, so same |p|, but their directions are symmetric about x-axis. So their total px is 2 p cos(theta), where p is E/c.

We set this equal to the initial px.

We found E=3 m_e c², from energy conservation.

So, substituting all, we got cos(theta)= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ≈ 0.3568 → theta ≈ 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2*69=138 degrees. So the correct answer is C)138.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation:

Wait, the initial total momentum is p_initial = p_A + p_B.

p_A = gamma_A * m_e v_A.

v_A is sqrt(15)/4 c.

So,

p_A =4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, p_B is gamma_B * m_e v_B.

v_B is sqrt(3)/2 c, but since it's moving left, it's negative.

So p_B =2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So p_initial is sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Yes, that's correct.

Then, after annihilation, total px of photons is 2 p cos(theta), where p=E/c, and E=3 m_e c².

So,

2*(3 m_e c² /c) * cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

(6 m_e c cos(theta) ) = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15)-sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta)= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6.

Which is approximately 0.3568.

So theta is arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

The angle between the photons is 2 theta ≈ 138 degrees.

So the answer is option C)138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Key Setup and Conservation Laws
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor of 4.
   - The positron moves to the left with a Lorentz factor of 2.
   - Both particles have the same rest mass, \( m_e \).

2. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_A m_e c^2 + \gamma_B m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
     \]
   - The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_A m_e v_A + \gamma_B m_e v_B,
     \]
     where \( v_A = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \) (for the electron) and \( v_B = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \) (for the positron). Substituting these values:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = m_e c \left( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \right).
     \]

3. **Photon Properties After Annihilation**:
   - The two photons have equal energy, \( E_1 = E_2 = E \), and their momenta are equal in magnitude (\( p = \frac{E}{c} \)) but symmetric about the x-axis due to the problem's geometry.
   - Let the angles of the photons with respect to the x-axis be \( +\theta \) and \( -\theta \). The total momentum of the photons is:
     \[
     p_{\text{final}} = 2 \frac{E}{c} \cos\theta \, \hat{x}.
     \]

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - Equating the initial and final momenta along the x-axis:
     \[
     2 \frac{E}{c} \cos\theta = m_e c \left( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \right).
     \]

5. **Conservation of Energy**:
   - The total energy after annihilation is the sum of the photons' energies:
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 2E.
     \]
   - Equating the initial and final energies:
     \[
     2E = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
     \]

6. **Solve for \( \cos\theta \)**:
   - Substituting \( E = 3 m_e c^2 \) into the momentum equation:
     \[
     2 \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} \cos\theta = m_e c \left( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \right).
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c \left( \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \right).
     \]
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
     \]

7. **Calculate \( \theta \)**:
   - Using \( \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3568 \), we find:
     \[
     \theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

8. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The photons are symmetric about the x-axis, so the angle between them is \( 2\theta \):
     \[
     2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
