Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's break it down step by step. 

The problem is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities inside a spherical detector. The setup is that when particles collide at the center, new particles are produced. These new particles decay quickly and move at a certain Lorentz factor. 

The given data is that with a Lorentz factor of about 20, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now the question is, what Lorentz factor would be needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead?

Hmm. So I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma such that 2/3 of the particles make it to the detector's walls. 

I remember that the Lorentz factor affects time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be gamma times their proper lifetime. 

Wait, right! The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. 

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so they have to travel a certain distance before decaying. If they decay before reaching the inner walls, they won't be detected. The ones that reach the walls are the ones that live long enough to make the trip. 

So the key here is the time it takes for the particles to reach the wall versus their lifetime. If the lifetime is longer than the travel time, they'll make it. 

The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The speed of the particles is close to the speed of light, so I can approximate their speed as c. Let me note that c is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. 

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by speed. So t = R / (v). Since v is approximately c, t ≈ R/(c). 

The proper lifetime tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees a dilated lifetime, which is gamma * tau. 

The probability that a particle will reach the detector's walls depends on whether its lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. Wait, more accurately, the fraction of particles that decay before reaching the wall is f = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). Because the decay follows an exponential distribution. 

But wait, the problem states that with gamma =20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So the fraction that reach the walls is 1/3. That means the fraction that decay before reaching is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. 

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The fraction that reach the walls is the fraction that do not decay during the time they're traveling. So the survival probability is what matters. 

The survival probability P is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it reaches the wall. So P = e^(-t/(gamma tau)). 

Given that t is R/(v), and v ≈ c, so t ≈ R/(c). 

So, when gamma is 20, P = 1/3. 

So, equation 1: e^(-R/(gamma c tau)) = 1/3. 

But wait, I probably don't know tau. But perhaps I can set up a ratio. Because when I change gamma, everything else remains the same, so I can relate the new gamma to the old one.

Let’s denote gamma1 = 20, and P1 = 1/3. We want to find gamma2 where P2 = 2/3. 

Wait no. Wait, the original problem says that with gamma ~20, one third reach the walls. So P1 is 1/3 when gamma is 20. Now, we need to find gamma where P is 2/3. Because the question is asking for two-thirds reaching the detector walls, so the survival probability is 2/3. 

So the equations are:
P1 = e^(-R/(gamma1 c tau)) = 1/3
P2 = e^(-R/(gamma2 c tau)) = 2/3

We can take the natural log of both sides to solve for the exponents.

For P1:
ln(1/3) = - R/(gamma1 c tau)
=> R/(gamma1 c tau) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)
Similarly, for P2:
ln(2/3) = - R/(gamma2 c tau)
=> R/(gamma2 c tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2)

Wait a second, so the ratio of R/(gamma c tau) between the two cases is ln(3) and ln(3/2). 

Let me write the equation in terms of gamma1 and gamma2.

From the first equation:
R/(gamma1 c tau) = ln(3)

From the second equation:
R/(gamma2 c tau) = ln(3/2)

If I take the ratio of these two equations: (R/(gamma2 c tau)) / (R/(gamma1 c tau)) ) = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln(3) ]

Simplify the left side: (gamma1 / gamma2) = [ ln(3/2) ] / [ ln(3) ]

So, gamma2 = gamma1 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]

Let me compute that. 

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2):

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So the ratio is 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.7088.

So gamma2 ≈ 20 * 2.7088 ≈ 54.176.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. 

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because I might have messed up which gamma is which.

Wait, because when gamma increases, the lifetime in the lab frame increases (gamma*tau), so the particles live longer. That would mean that more of them would reach the walls, because they have more time to make the journey. 

So, if initially with gamma1=20, the survival probability was 1/3. Now, we want a higher gamma, say gamma2, to get a higher survival probability of 2/3. So the calculation I did earlier suggests gamma2 is about 54, which is higher than 20, which makes sense. 

So the answer should be option A) 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The time \( t \) is approximately:

\[
t \approx \frac{R}{c}
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the detector and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Relating survival probabilities
When \( \gamma = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula:

\[
\ln(P_1) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau}
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \gamma_1 = 20 \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{20 c \tau}
\]

\[
\frac{R}{20 c \tau} = \ln(3)
\]

For the desired survival probability \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \), we use:

\[
\ln(P_2) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau}
\]

\[
\frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Relating the two cases
Dividing the equations for \( \frac{R}{\gamma_2 c \tau} \) and \( \frac{R}{\gamma_1 c \tau} \):

\[
\frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)}
\]

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3/2)}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical calculation
Using \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln(3/2) \approx 0.4055 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.7088 \approx 54.176
\]

Thus, the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 = 54 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:
