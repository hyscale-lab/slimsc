Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to think about how to approach this.

Alright, the setup is this: there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I remember that when a conductor is grounded, it allows charges to flow in or out as needed, so the potential on the surface of the conductor is the same as the ground's potential, which is usually taken as zero.

Potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to assemble the charges. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, maybe some induced charges will be involved. Let me think: the charge q would induce charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute themselves.

The conducting sphere can be thought of as having an induced charge. Wait, but because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. So any induced charges would adjust to ensure that.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So, the sphere being grounded would cause the induced charges to adjust. I think the sphere will have an induced charge that's opposite to q, but I'm not sure. Or wait, no. When you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface would have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface would have induced charges depending on whether the sphere is isolated or grounded. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so any excess charge can flow away.

Wait, actually, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, since it's a conductor, the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. The inner surface of the sphere will have an induced charge of -q (if q is positive) because the conducting material's electrons would be attracted to the charge. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge beyond what's induced on the inner surface can flow to the ground. So the outer surface of the sphere would have zero charge because all the induced charges have gone to the ground. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up something. Let me think again. The charge q outside would polarize the conductor. The inner surface of the conductor would have induced charges, but because the conductor is neutral (since it's grounded and can lose or gain charges), the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to make the total charge zero. But wait, no, because if the conductor is initially neutral, the inner surface would have -q (attracted by q), and the outer surface would have +q to cancel, but then the sphere would have a net charge of +q. But that can't happen because it's grounded. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, when a charge q is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have a charge of +q. But wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded, so any excess charge can flow away. So if the inner surface has -q, that would mean that the sphere would have to have a net charge of -q, but since it's grounded, it can lose electrons (negative charges) to the ground, making the external surface have zero charge. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe another approach. The system's potential energy is due to the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But how?

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of a system can be calculated as the work done to bring the charges together. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe the potential at infinity is zero, and the sphere's potential is zero as well.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the center of the sphere. But for a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface and inside. Since it's grounded, the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential at the center due to the charge q and the induced charges must also be zero.

Hmm, maybe I should model the induced charge on the sphere. The conducting sphere, being grounded, will have a net charge of zero, but when the charge q is brought near, charges redistribute. So the inner surface of the sphere will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total zero (because the sphere was neutral to begin with). Wait, wait noâ€” the sphere is grounded, so any excess charge beyond what's induced on the inner and outer surfaces would flow to ground. Wait, perhaps the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has some charge, but the sphere's total charge is zero only if the sum of inner and outer charges is zero. Because the sphere is conducting and neutral, perhaps.

Wait, no. Wait, when you place a charge q outside a conducting sphere, the inner surface of the sphere has an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface has a charge of +q. But if the sphere is grounded, the outer surface charge can be neutralized. Oh, wait, no: when you bring a charge near the conducting sphere, it induces charges on the inner surface. Since the sphere was initially neutral, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance. But if the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface can flow into the ground, leaving the outer surface neutral. So the total charge on the sphere would be zero.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have a charge q outside, the sphere's inner surface has -q. The conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. But if the sphere is grounded, the +q can flow away, hence the sphere's net charge is -q. Wait, but I thought that in the presence of an external charge, the sphere's induced charges on the inner surface are equal and opposite. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons. So the sphere's inner surface would have -q, meaning the sphere itself would have to have a net charge of -q. But that depends on whether the sphere was initially neutral. The problem says the sphere is conducting and grounded, but I don't think it specifies the initial charge. I think the sphere is initially neutral.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to make the total charge zero. But if the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can lose the +q charge, so the sphere remains neutral. That can't be right because the inner charge is -q, which would require that the sphere has a net charge of -q. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think in terms of method of images.

Wait, the method of images says that a charge outside a conducting sphere can be modeled as the charge and its image charge. The image charge would be located at a distance such that the image charge's distance from the sphere's center is related to the sphere's radius and the original charge's position.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps with potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, considering the induced charges.

Wait, another thought: when you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the system's potential energy is the work done against the electric field. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the location of charge q is due to the sphere's induced charges. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the sphere as a capacitor. The charge q induces a charge on the sphere. The potential energy would then be related to the energy stored in the capacitor formed between the charge q and the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the potential inside the conductor is the same as the surface. Since it's grounded, the potential there is zero.

Hmm, perhaps considering the potential at the charge q. The potential at q due to the sphere's induced charges would be something. The potential energy would be q times that potential.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for the formula.

I remember that when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the induced charge on the sphere is -q. But wait, no, because the sphere is grounded. So the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, maybe the potential at the center of the sphere is the same as the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges. Since it's a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere inside and on the surface.

Wait, the potential due to a charge q located at a distance d from the center of the sphere would be V = kq/(d'), where d' is the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere. But the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from the charge to the surface is d - R, but wait, that depends on the direction. If the charge is placed along the axis, then the distance from the charge to a point on the surface is sqrt(d^2 + R^2) in the radial direction. Wait, no, if the charge is at a distance d from the center, then the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere's surface would be varying, but the potential at the surface would be due to the charge and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's potential is zero, so the sum of the potentials due to q and the induced charges on the sphere is zero.

Alternatively, considering that the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must sum to zero there.

Wait, the induced charges would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q plus the potential due to the induced charges equals zero. But the induced charges would be -q'. Hmm, perhaps the image charge method can be used here.

Wait, the method of images for a conducting sphere says that the charge q outside the sphere induces an image charge of -qR/d, where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to the charge q. The image charge is located on the line connecting the charge and the center, at a distance d' = R^2 / d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at distance d from the center is q' = (q R^2 )/(dÂ² - RÂ²)^(1/2) ) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, considering that the sphere's induced charge is -q' and that the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges.

But perhaps another approach is better. The potential energy U of the system can be calculated as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which means that the potential due to all charges (including q and the induced charges) is zero on the sphere.

Wait, but when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge -q, and the outer surface will have +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface's +q can flow away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the charge q induces a charge on the sphere, but the sphere being grounded allows it to maintain zero potential on its surface.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the capacitance approach. The potential energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) Q V. In this case, the charge q would act as one plate, and the conducting sphere as the other, with the sphere's potential at zero.

Wait, but how does that work? The sphere's potential is zero, so the potential difference is just the potential due to q at the sphere's surface. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V = kq/(d + R) if the charge is placed along the axis. Wait no, the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from charge q to the sphere's surface would be d - R if the charge is placed along the axis at distance d from the center. But d might be larger than R. Wait, no, if the charge is placed at a distance d from the center, then the distance from the charge to the surface along the same line would be d Â± R. But if the charge is outside the sphere, then the closest distance is d - R, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is (kq)/(distance between q and the surface). So if the charge is at a distance d from the center, the distance from q to the surface is sqrt(dÂ² + RÂ²) if the charge is placed perpendicular to the sphere's surface. Wait, no, that's when the charge is at (d, 0, 0) and the sphere has radius R, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along the x-axis is d - R. Wait no, that's only if d is along the same line. Oh, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should model the sphere as a point charge located at the center. No, that's only an approximation when the charge is far away. But in this case, the charge is at a finite distance d, so that approximation wouldn't hold.

Wait, maybe the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the work done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the system due to the interaction between the charge and the induced charges.

Alternatively, I recall that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the potential energy is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Hmm, but I thought the denominator would be dÂ² + RÂ². Or maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere's induced charges can be modeled as a point charge located at the center, but with a certain magnitude. Wait, but that's only an approximation when d is much larger than R. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the induced charge as a point charge at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the presence of the sphere. The sphere, being grounded, will have induced charges that affect the potential.

Wait, when you bring charge q to a distance d, the work done is against the electric field. The potential at the location of q due to the induced charges on the sphere would be something, say V_induced. So the potential energy U would be q * V_induced.

But how to find V_induced?

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. But the potential inside the sphere (including the point where the charge is located) is due to the charge q and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the potential inside the sphere due to charge q and the induced charge is zero. So the potential at the center of the sphere is zero, but what about at the point where q is located?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the location of charge q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere's induced charges can be considered as a point charge at the center. Wait, but that's an approximation.

Wait, the induced charge on a conducting sphere in the presence of an external charge can be modeled using the method of images. The image charge q' is located at a distance such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. The image charge would be inside the sphere, at a distance RÂ²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q.

Wait, maybe the image charge is given by q' = - (RÂ²/d) * q / (dÂ² - RÂ²)^(1/2) )? I'm not sure, but perhaps the image charge concept can help here.

Alternatively, the potential at the charge q due to the sphere's induced charges would be the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential energy U would be k q q' / (distance between q and q'), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the image charge q' would be located at a distance d' from the center, such that d' = RÂ²/d. So the distance between q and q' would be d + d' = d + RÂ²/d. So the potential energy would be U = k q q' / (d + RÂ²/d) = k q (-q RÂ²/d) / ( (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ) ) = k q (-q RÂ²)/d * d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) = - k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2)k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Hmm, none of these match what I just calculated.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Let me think again. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at distance d from the center is given by q' = (RÂ²/d) q. Wait, no, the image charge is actually q' = (RÂ²/d) q. But wait, the sign is minus when the charge is outside. So q' = - (RÂ²/d) q.

Wait, no, I think the image charge is q' = (RÂ²/d) q, but perhaps when the charge is outside, the image is inside the sphere. So the image charge would be located at a distance RÂ²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from the charge q.

So the distance between q and the image charge q' would be d + (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be the work done to bring the charge q and the image charge q' into position. But wait, how?

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges (which are modeled as q'). So the potential energy would be U = (1/2) k (q q')/(distance between q and q').

Wait, but in this case, the image charge is q' = - (RÂ²/d) q. So substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ].

Simplifying, the denominator is (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d, so when we invert and multiply, it becomes d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = (1/2) k [ (- RÂ² qÂ² /d ) ] * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ] = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Hmm, that gives U = - (1/2) k RÂ² qÂ² / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

But looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(d^2 - R^2). Hmm, none of them match this.

Wait, did I get the image charge right? Maybe I made a mistake in the image charge formula. Let me double-check. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at a distance d from the center is given by q' = (R^2/d) q, but wait, the correct formula is actually q' = (R^2/d) q, but with a negative sign when the charge is outside the sphere. So q' = - (R^2 q) / d.

Wait, then the distance between q and q' would be d + (R^2/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be the work done to bring q and q' into their positions, but since the image charge is a result of the induced charges, perhaps the total potential energy is (1/2) k (q q')/r, where r is the distance between them.

So substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + R^2)/d ].

Simplify numerator: ( - RÂ² qÂ² ) / d.

Denominator: (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d â†’ which inverts to d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = (1/2) k [ (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / d ] * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ].

The d's cancel out: U = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is different. So none of the options match this. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is due to the charge and the induced charge on the sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the sphere is grounded, so the image charge approach may not directly apply.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the energy required to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the charge's position is due to q itself and the induced charges.

Wait, but q is being brought in; the work done is against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. So the potential at the charge's position due to the induced charges is V_induced, and the work done is q * V_induced.

But how to find V_induced.

Hmm, perhaps the induced charge on the sphere is -q, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere, being a conductor, can be treated as a point charge located at its center for points outside the sphere. But in this case, the charge q is at a distance d from the center, outside the sphere (assuming d > R). So the potential at q due to the sphere's induced charges would be V = k (-q) / d.

Wait, so the potential energy U would be q * V = q * (-k q / d) ) = -k qÂ² / d.

But that's not matching any of the options either. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't have this expression. The closest option is A: U = - (1/2)k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2).

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the system's potential energy as the sum of the potential energies between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges are such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. So the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but let's model the induced charge as a point charge at the center. Then the potential at the location of q would be V = k Q_induced / d.

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at the center is due to the induced charge. Wait, but the induced charge on the sphere's inner surface is -q. So the potential at the center due to this charge is V_inner = k (-q) / R. But the sphere itself is a conductor, so the potential is the same across the entire conductor, including the surface. So setting the surface potential to zero, V_surface = 0.

Wait, the potential at the center due to the inner induced charge is V_inner = k (-q) / R.

But the potential on the surface is zero, so the sum of the potentials from the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, but since the sphere is grounded, that charge flows away, leaving the outer surface neutral. So the total charge on the sphere is -q.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me try another approach.

The potential energy U of the system can be thought of as the energy required to assemble the charge q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. But wait, if the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface would flow away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere remains neutral. If the sphere is neutral, then the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q, but that would make the net charge zero. But then the sphere's potential would be determined by the outer surface's charge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy of the charge q in the electric field of the induced charges. The induced charges would consist of -q on the inner surface, and if the sphere is neutral, +q on the outer surface. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons, so perhaps the outer surface's charge flows away, making the sphere have a net charge of -q. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the system's potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the induced charge on the sphere's inner surface is -q, so the potential energy would be the energy stored in the capacitor formed between charge q and the induced -q on the sphere.

The capacitance of a sphere is C = 4 Ï€ Îµâ‚€ R, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, the capacitance between the charge q and the sphere is C = 4 Ï€ Îµâ‚€ (d), where d is the distance between them. Hmm, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is U = (1/2) Q V, where Q is the charge and V is the potential it's placed in. But in this case, the induced charges on the sphere would contribute to the potential at the charge q's location.

Wait, the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere would be the same as the potential due to a point charge at the center of the sphere, with charge -q. Because for a sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as a point charge at the center for points outside the sphere.

So the potential at q's location would be V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy U would be U = q * V = q * (-k q / d ) = -k qÂ² / d.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the work done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere's induced charges are -q, the work done is bringing q into a potential due to -q, which is V = k (-q) / (d).

The potential energy U would then be q * V = - k qÂ² / d.

Again, not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the induced charges on the sphere are not simply -q. Perhaps the induced charge depends on the distance d. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the sum of the potential due to charge q and the induced charge Q on the sphere is zero on the sphere's surface.

So, the potential on the sphere's surface due to charge q is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is placed along the same line as the center of the sphere and the surface point.

Wait, no, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface would be sqrt(dÂ² - RÂ²) if the charge is placed along the line through the center. Wait, no, if the charge is at distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to the surface along that line is d - R, but that's only if d > R. If d < R, the charge is inside the sphere, which is not the case here.

So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is outside. Wait, no, because if the charge is at distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere's surface along the same line is d - R (if d > R). But wait, no, if the charge is at a distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to the surface is d - R if the charge is on the same side as the surface point.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as the potential on the sphere's surface being zero, so V_q + V_induced = 0.

V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. But I'm not sure if r is d - R or something else.

Wait, more accurately, the distance from charge q to the center of the sphere is d. The radius of the sphere is R. So the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along the same line is d - R (if d > R). So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R).

But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. The total potential there must be zero, so the potential due to the induced charges must be - V_q. So the induced charge Q on the sphere must produce a potential of - V_q on the sphere's surface.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to the induced charge Q is V_induced = k Q / R.

So, we have V_q + V_induced = 0 â†’ (k q)/(d - R) + (k Q)/R = 0 â†’ Q = - (R q)/(d - R).

Wait, but this is when the charge q is located along the line extending from the center and the point on the sphere. But in reality, the charge could be placed anywhere, but the problem says it's placed at a distance d from the center, so perhaps it's placed along that line for simplicity.

So the induced charge Q = - [ R q ] / (d - R).

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, which involves the potential due to the induced charge Q.

Wait, but the potential energy U is the work done against the electric field. So when bringing q from infinity to its position, the work done is q times the potential at its position due to the induced charge Q.

The potential at the charge q's location due to Q is V = k Q / d.

Substituting Q, V = k [ - R q / (d - R) ] / d.

So U = q * V = q * [ - k R q / (d (d - R) ) ] = - k R qÂ² / [ d (d - R) ) ].

Wait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + R^2)

Option C: U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - R^2)

Hmm, none of the options match this expression. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the charge q and the induced charges. Since the induced charges are on the sphere, which is grounded, perhaps the potential energy is only the energy due to the charge q and the induced charge Q.

But maybe the formula should account for the fact that the induced charge is Q = - q RÂ² / d, as in the image charge method.

Wait, earlier I thought the image charge was q' = - (RÂ²/d) q. So perhaps the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q', which would be d + (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So, substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ].

Simplify the denominator: (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d â†’ 1/(denominator) is d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U becomes (1/2) * k * (- RÂ² qÂ²/d) * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ].

The d's cancel out, so U = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²) â†’ U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Looking at the options, none of them have R squared in the numerator. Option A has d, and option C has RÂ² in the numerator but the denominator is (dÂ² - R^2) and a 1/2 factor. So this suggests I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the image charge method is not applicable here because the sphere is grounded. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's potential energy can be found using the formula for the potential energy between two charges, considering the image charge as another charge. So U = (1/2) k q q' / r.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the presence of the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the charge's position is due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface, but since the sphere is grounded, the +q flows away, leaving the sphere with -q. So the potential at the charge's position is due to -q, located at the center.

So the potential at the charge q's location is V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy U would be q * V = -k qÂ² / d. But this isn't one of the options either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for similar problems or standard formulas.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a charge q placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2), assuming d > R. Wait, that's option C: U = -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2).

But why would that be the case? Let me think about energy. When you bring a charge q near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere do work in bringing the charge closer, and the potential energy is stored in the system as the charge and the induced charges' configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere. The calculation might involve integrating the electric field of the induced charges.

But without knowing the exact distribution of the induced charges, it's hard to integrate. But perhaps we can model the induced charges as a point charge at the center of the sphere.

So the potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q Q_induced / d, where Q_induced is the induced charge on the sphere.

But earlier, I found that Q_induced = - R q/(d - R).

So substituting, U = (1/2) k q * (- R q/(d - R)) / d = - (1/2) k R qÂ² / [ d (d - R) ) ].

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options either. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.

Wait, another thought: the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charge Q must cancel on the sphere's surface.

The potential due to q at the sphere's surface is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is placed outside along the same line. The potential due to the induced charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R. So V_q + V_Q = 0 â†’ Q = - (R q) / (d + R).

Wait, that's different from before. So Q = - R q/(d + R).

Now, the potential at the charge q's location due to Q is V = k Q / d = k (- R q/(d + R)) ) / d = - k R q / [ d (d + R) ) ].

The potential energy U is then q * V = - k R qÂ² / [ d (d + R) ) ].

Hmm, this expression is still not matching any of the options. Option A is - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), which is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy stored in the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface, but since it's grounded, the outer surface's +q flows away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

But then the potential energy would be the energy due to the charge q and the -q on the sphere.

The potential energy U between two point charges is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. So here, q1 is q, q2 is -q, and r is d.

So U = (1/2) k q (-q) / d = - (1/2) k qÂ² / d.

But again, this doesn't match any options provided. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²). If I factor out, d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) can be written as 1/(d + RÂ²/d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the induced charge as a point charge at the center, but the potential energy is U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2). Which is option C.

But why would that be the case? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the potential energy between the charge q and the induced image charge is given by that formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. I think I'm getting stuck here because I'm unsure about the exact method to calculate the potential energy in this scenario.

Wait, another way to think about it: the potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. When you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The work done in bringing q to its position is the potential energy.

But without knowing the exact distribution of the induced charges, it's challenging. However, based on the options and the image charge method, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, earlier calculation using the image charge gave U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (d^2 + R^2), which doesn't match any option. But option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² R^2/(d^2 - R^2). So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance is R^2/d, and the distance between q and q' is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So then, the potential energy U would be (1/2) k (q q') / r, where q' is the image charge.

So q' = - (R^2 q)/d.

r = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- R^2 q/d) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ].

Simplify denominator: [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] â†’ 1/(denominator) is d/(d^2 - R^2).

So U = (1/2) * k * [ (- R^2 q^2 ) / d ) ] * [ d/(d^2 - R^2) ) ].

The d's cancel: U = (1/2) * k * (- R^2 q^2 ) / (d^2 - R^2 ).

Which gives U = - (1/2) k R^2 q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 ), which is option C.

Wait, that's the same as option C. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its surface potential is zero. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. The induced charges redistribute such that the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Sphere**:  
   The charge \( q \) induces a charge of \( -q \) on the inner surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface remains neutral, and the net charge on the sphere is \( -q \).

2. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the sphere. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy can be derived using the method of images or by considering the energy stored in the system due to the induced charge distribution.

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   The method of images simplifies the calculation by modeling the induced charges as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center of the sphere, on the opposite side of the sphere from \( q \). The total potential energy is then given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r},
   \]
   where \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \) is the distance between \( q \) and the image charge.

4. **Substitution and Simplification**:  
   Substituting \( q' \) and \( r \) into the formula for \( U \), we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I need to think about how to approach this.

Alright, the setup is this: there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I remember that when a conductor is grounded, it allows charges to flow in or out as needed, so the potential on the surface of the conductor is the same as the ground's potential, which is usually taken as zero.

Potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to assemble the charges. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, maybe some induced charges will be involved. Let me think: the charge q would induce charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute themselves.

The conducting sphere can be thought of as having an induced charge. Wait, but because it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero. So any induced charges would adjust to ensure that.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere. So, the sphere being grounded would cause the induced charges to adjust. I think the sphere will have an induced charge that's opposite to q, but I'm not sure. Or wait, no. When you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface would have an induced charge opposite to q, and the outer surface would have induced charges depending on whether the sphere is isolated or grounded. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so any excess charge can flow away.

Wait, actually, when the charge q is placed near the sphere, since it's a conductor, the charges inside the conductor will redistribute. The inner surface of the sphere will have an induced charge of -q (if q is positive) because the conducting material's electrons would be attracted to the charge. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge beyond what's induced on the inner surface can flow to the ground. So the outer surface of the sphere would have zero charge because all the induced charges have gone to the ground. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up something. Let me think again. The charge q outside would polarize the conductor. The inner surface of the conductor would have induced charges, but because the conductor is neutral (since it's grounded and can lose or gain charges), the inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to make the total charge zero. But wait, no, because if the conductor is initially neutral, the inner surface would have -q (attracted by q), and the outer surface would have +q to cancel, but then the sphere would have a net charge of +q. But that can't happen because it's grounded. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, when a charge q is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have a charge of +q. But wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded, so any excess charge can flow away. So if the inner surface has -q, that would mean that the sphere would have to have a net charge of -q, but since it's grounded, it can lose electrons (negative charges) to the ground, making the external surface have zero charge. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe another approach. The system's potential energy is due to the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But how?

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of a system can be calculated as the work done to bring the charges together. But since the sphere is grounded, maybe the potential at infinity is zero, and the sphere's potential is zero as well.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the center of the sphere. But for a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface and inside. Since it's grounded, the potential on the surface is zero. So the potential at the center due to the charge q and the induced charges must also be zero.

Hmm, maybe I should model the induced charge on the sphere. The conducting sphere, being grounded, will have a net charge of zero, but when the charge q is brought near, charges redistribute. So the inner surface of the sphere will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface must have a charge of +q to make the total zero (because the sphere was neutral to begin with). Wait, wait noâ€” the sphere is grounded, so any excess charge beyond what's induced on the inner and outer surfaces would flow to ground. Wait, perhaps the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has some charge, but the sphere's total charge is zero only if the sum of inner and outer charges is zero. Because the sphere is conducting and neutral, perhaps.

Wait, no. Wait, when you place a charge q outside a conducting sphere, the inner surface of the sphere has an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface has a charge of +q. But if the sphere is grounded, the outer surface charge can be neutralized. Oh, wait, no: when you bring a charge near the conducting sphere, it induces charges on the inner surface. Since the sphere was initially neutral, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance. But if the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface can flow into the ground, leaving the outer surface neutral. So the total charge on the sphere would be zero.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have a charge q outside, the sphere's inner surface has -q. The conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. But if the sphere is grounded, the +q can flow away, hence the sphere's net charge is -q. Wait, but I thought that in the presence of an external charge, the sphere's induced charges on the inner surface are equal and opposite. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons. So the sphere's inner surface would have -q, meaning the sphere itself would have to have a net charge of -q. But that depends on whether the sphere was initially neutral. The problem says the sphere is conducting and grounded, but I don't think it specifies the initial charge. I think the sphere is initially neutral.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to make the total charge zero. But if the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can lose the +q charge, so the sphere remains neutral. That can't be right because the inner charge is -q, which would require that the sphere has a net charge of -q. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think in terms of method of images.

Wait, the method of images says that a charge outside a conducting sphere can be modeled as the charge and its image charge. The image charge would be located at a distance such that the image charge's distance from the sphere's center is related to the sphere's radius and the original charge's position.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps with potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, considering the induced charges.

Wait, another thought: when you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the system's potential energy is the work done against the electric field. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the location of charge q is due to the sphere's induced charges. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the sphere as a capacitor. The charge q induces a charge on the sphere. The potential energy would then be related to the energy stored in the capacitor formed between the charge q and the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the potential inside the conductor is the same as the surface. Since it's grounded, the potential there is zero.

Hmm, perhaps considering the potential at the charge q. The potential at q due to the sphere's induced charges would be something. The potential energy would be q times that potential.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for the formula.

I remember that when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the induced charge on the sphere is -q. But wait, no, because the sphere is grounded. So the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

Wait, maybe the potential at the center of the sphere is the same as the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges. Since it's a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere inside and on the surface.

Wait, the potential due to a charge q located at a distance d from the center of the sphere would be V = kq/(d'), where d' is the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere. But the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from the charge to the surface is d - R, but wait, that depends on the direction. If the charge is placed along the axis, then the distance from the charge to a point on the surface is sqrt(d^2 + R^2) in the radial direction. Wait, no, if the charge is at a distance d from the center, then the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere's surface would be varying, but the potential at the surface would be due to the charge and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's potential is zero, so the sum of the potentials due to q and the induced charges on the sphere is zero.

Alternatively, considering that the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges must sum to zero there.

Wait, the induced charges would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q plus the potential due to the induced charges equals zero. But the induced charges would be -q'. Hmm, perhaps the image charge method can be used here.

Wait, the method of images for a conducting sphere says that the charge q outside the sphere induces an image charge of -qR/d, where d is the distance from the center of the sphere to the charge q. The image charge is located on the line connecting the charge and the center, at a distance d' = R^2 / d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at distance d from the center is q' = (q R^2 )/(dÂ² - RÂ²)^(1/2) ) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, considering that the sphere's induced charge is -q' and that the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges.

But perhaps another approach is better. The potential energy U of the system can be calculated as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which means that the potential due to all charges (including q and the induced charges) is zero on the sphere.

Wait, but when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge -q, and the outer surface will have +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface's +q can flow away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the charge q induces a charge on the sphere, but the sphere being grounded allows it to maintain zero potential on its surface.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider the capacitance approach. The potential energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) Q V. In this case, the charge q would act as one plate, and the conducting sphere as the other, with the sphere's potential at zero.

Wait, but how does that work? The sphere's potential is zero, so the potential difference is just the potential due to q at the sphere's surface. So the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V = kq/(d + R) if the charge is placed along the axis. Wait no, the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from charge q to the sphere's surface would be d - R if the charge is placed along the axis at distance d from the center. But d might be larger than R. Wait, no, if the charge is placed at a distance d from the center, then the distance from the charge to the surface along the same line would be d Â± R. But if the charge is outside the sphere, then the closest distance is d - R, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is (kq)/(distance between q and the surface). So if the charge is at a distance d from the center, the distance from q to the surface is sqrt(dÂ² + RÂ²) if the charge is placed perpendicular to the sphere's surface. Wait, no, that's when the charge is at (d, 0, 0) and the sphere has radius R, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along the x-axis is d - R. Wait no, that's only if d is along the same line. Oh, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should model the sphere as a point charge located at the center. No, that's only an approximation when the charge is far away. But in this case, the charge is at a finite distance d, so that approximation wouldn't hold.

Wait, maybe the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the work done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy stored in the system due to the interaction between the charge and the induced charges.

Alternatively, I recall that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the potential energy is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Hmm, but I thought the denominator would be dÂ² + RÂ². Or maybe not.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere's induced charges can be modeled as a point charge located at the center, but with a certain magnitude. Wait, but that's only an approximation when d is much larger than R. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the induced charge as a point charge at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the presence of the sphere. The sphere, being grounded, will have induced charges that affect the potential.

Wait, when you bring charge q to a distance d, the work done is against the electric field. The potential at the location of q due to the induced charges on the sphere would be something, say V_induced. So the potential energy U would be q * V_induced.

But how to find V_induced?

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. But the potential inside the sphere (including the point where the charge is located) is due to the charge q and the induced charges.

Wait, perhaps the potential inside the sphere due to charge q and the induced charge is zero. So the potential at the center of the sphere is zero, but what about at the point where q is located?

Alternatively, perhaps the potential at the location of charge q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere's induced charges can be considered as a point charge at the center. Wait, but that's an approximation.

Wait, the induced charge on a conducting sphere in the presence of an external charge can be modeled using the method of images. The image charge q' is located at a distance such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. The image charge would be inside the sphere, at a distance RÂ²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q.

Wait, maybe the image charge is given by q' = - (RÂ²/d) * q / (dÂ² - RÂ²)^(1/2) )? I'm not sure, but perhaps the image charge concept can help here.

Alternatively, the potential at the charge q due to the sphere's induced charges would be the same as the potential due to the image charge. So the potential energy U would be k q q' / (distance between q and q'), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the image charge q' would be located at a distance d' from the center, such that d' = RÂ²/d. So the distance between q and q' would be d + d' = d + RÂ²/d. So the potential energy would be U = k q q' / (d + RÂ²/d) = k q (-q RÂ²/d) / ( (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ) ) = k q (-q RÂ²)/d * d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) = - k qÂ² RÂ² / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2)k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - RÂ²). Hmm, none of these match what I just calculated.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Let me think again. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at distance d from the center is given by q' = (RÂ²/d) q. Wait, no, the image charge is actually q' = (RÂ²/d) q. But wait, the sign is minus when the charge is outside. So q' = - (RÂ²/d) q.

Wait, no, I think the image charge is q' = (RÂ²/d) q, but perhaps when the charge is outside, the image is inside the sphere. So the image charge would be located at a distance RÂ²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from the charge q.

So the distance between q and the image charge q' would be d + (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be the work done to bring the charge q and the image charge q' into position. But wait, how?

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges (which are modeled as q'). So the potential energy would be U = (1/2) k (q q')/(distance between q and q').

Wait, but in this case, the image charge is q' = - (RÂ²/d) q. So substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ].

Simplifying, the denominator is (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d, so when we invert and multiply, it becomes d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = (1/2) k [ (- RÂ² qÂ² /d ) ] * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ] = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Hmm, that gives U = - (1/2) k RÂ² qÂ² / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

But looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(d^2 - R^2). Hmm, none of them match this.

Wait, did I get the image charge right? Maybe I made a mistake in the image charge formula. Let me double-check. The image charge for a sphere of radius R when a charge q is at a distance d from the center is given by q' = (R^2/d) q, but wait, the correct formula is actually q' = (R^2/d) q, but with a negative sign when the charge is outside the sphere. So q' = - (R^2 q) / d.

Wait, then the distance between q and q' would be d + (R^2/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be the work done to bring q and q' into their positions, but since the image charge is a result of the induced charges, perhaps the total potential energy is (1/2) k (q q')/r, where r is the distance between them.

So substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + R^2)/d ].

Simplify numerator: ( - RÂ² qÂ² ) / d.

Denominator: (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d â†’ which inverts to d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = (1/2) k [ (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / d ] * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ].

The d's cancel out: U = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ² ) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), and option C is different. So none of the options match this. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is due to the charge and the induced charge on the sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the sphere is grounded, so the image charge approach may not directly apply.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the energy required to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the charge's position is due to q itself and the induced charges.

Wait, but q is being brought in; the work done is against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. So the potential at the charge's position due to the induced charges is V_induced, and the work done is q * V_induced.

But how to find V_induced.

Hmm, perhaps the induced charge on the sphere is -q, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere, being a conductor, can be treated as a point charge located at its center for points outside the sphere. But in this case, the charge q is at a distance d from the center, outside the sphere (assuming d > R). So the potential at q due to the sphere's induced charges would be V = k (-q) / d.

Wait, so the potential energy U would be q * V = q * (-k q / d) ) = -k qÂ² / d.

But that's not matching any of the options either. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't have this expression. The closest option is A: U = - (1/2)k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2).

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the system's potential energy as the sum of the potential energies between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges are such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential. So the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but let's model the induced charge as a point charge at the center. Then the potential at the location of q would be V = k Q_induced / d.

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at the center is due to the induced charge. Wait, but the induced charge on the sphere's inner surface is -q. So the potential at the center due to this charge is V_inner = k (-q) / R. But the sphere itself is a conductor, so the potential is the same across the entire conductor, including the surface. So setting the surface potential to zero, V_surface = 0.

Wait, the potential at the center due to the inner induced charge is V_inner = k (-q) / R.

But the potential on the surface is zero, so the sum of the potentials from the inner and outer surfaces must be zero. Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, but since the sphere is grounded, that charge flows away, leaving the outer surface neutral. So the total charge on the sphere is -q.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me try another approach.

The potential energy U of the system can be thought of as the energy required to assemble the charge q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. But wait, if the sphere is grounded, the +q on the outer surface would flow away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere remains neutral. If the sphere is neutral, then the inner surface has -q and the outer surface has +q, but that would make the net charge zero. But then the sphere's potential would be determined by the outer surface's charge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the energy of the charge q in the electric field of the induced charges. The induced charges would consist of -q on the inner surface, and if the sphere is neutral, +q on the outer surface. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons, so perhaps the outer surface's charge flows away, making the sphere have a net charge of -q. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the system's potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the induced charge on the sphere's inner surface is -q, so the potential energy would be the energy stored in the capacitor formed between charge q and the induced -q on the sphere.

The capacitance of a sphere is C = 4 Ï€ Îµâ‚€ R, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, the capacitance between the charge q and the sphere is C = 4 Ï€ Îµâ‚€ (d), where d is the distance between them. Hmm, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is U = (1/2) Q V, where Q is the charge and V is the potential it's placed in. But in this case, the induced charges on the sphere would contribute to the potential at the charge q's location.

Wait, the potential at the charge q due to the induced charges on the sphere would be the same as the potential due to a point charge at the center of the sphere, with charge -q. Because for a sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as a point charge at the center for points outside the sphere.

So the potential at q's location would be V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy U would be U = q * V = q * (-k q / d ) = -k qÂ² / d.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the work done against the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere's induced charges are -q, the work done is bringing q into a potential due to -q, which is V = k (-q) / (d).

The potential energy U would then be q * V = - k qÂ² / d.

Again, not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the induced charges on the sphere are not simply -q. Perhaps the induced charge depends on the distance d. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the sum of the potential due to charge q and the induced charge Q on the sphere is zero on the sphere's surface.

So, the potential on the sphere's surface due to charge q is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is placed along the same line as the center of the sphere and the surface point.

Wait, no, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface would be sqrt(dÂ² - RÂ²) if the charge is placed along the line through the center. Wait, no, if the charge is at distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to the surface along that line is d - R, but that's only if d > R. If d < R, the charge is inside the sphere, which is not the case here.

So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is outside. Wait, no, because if the charge is at distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to a point on the sphere's surface along the same line is d - R (if d > R). But wait, no, if the charge is at a distance d from the center, the distance from the charge to the surface is d - R if the charge is on the same side as the surface point.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as the potential on the sphere's surface being zero, so V_q + V_induced = 0.

V_q = k q / r, where r is the distance from q to the sphere's surface. But I'm not sure if r is d - R or something else.

Wait, more accurately, the distance from charge q to the center of the sphere is d. The radius of the sphere is R. So the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface along the same line is d - R (if d > R). So the potential on the sphere's surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R).

But the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. The total potential there must be zero, so the potential due to the induced charges must be - V_q. So the induced charge Q on the sphere must produce a potential of - V_q on the sphere's surface.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to the induced charge Q is V_induced = k Q / R.

So, we have V_q + V_induced = 0 â†’ (k q)/(d - R) + (k Q)/R = 0 â†’ Q = - (R q)/(d - R).

Wait, but this is when the charge q is located along the line extending from the center and the point on the sphere. But in reality, the charge could be placed anywhere, but the problem says it's placed at a distance d from the center, so perhaps it's placed along that line for simplicity.

So the induced charge Q = - [ R q ] / (d - R).

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, which involves the potential due to the induced charge Q.

Wait, but the potential energy U is the work done against the electric field. So when bringing q from infinity to its position, the work done is q times the potential at its position due to the induced charge Q.

The potential at the charge q's location due to Q is V = k Q / d.

Substituting Q, V = k [ - R q / (d - R) ] / d.

So U = q * V = q * [ - k R q / (d (d - R) ) ] = - k R qÂ² / [ d (d - R) ) ].

Wait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + R^2)

Option C: U = -(1/2) k qÂ² RÂ²/(dÂ² - R^2)

Hmm, none of the options match this expression. So perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the charge q and the induced charges. Since the induced charges are on the sphere, which is grounded, perhaps the potential energy is only the energy due to the charge q and the induced charge Q.

But maybe the formula should account for the fact that the induced charge is Q = - q RÂ² / d, as in the image charge method.

Wait, earlier I thought the image charge was q' = - (RÂ²/d) q. So perhaps the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q', which would be d + (RÂ²/d) = (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d.

So, substituting, U = (1/2) k [ q * (- RÂ² q/d) ) ] / [ (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d ].

Simplify the denominator: (dÂ² + RÂ²)/d â†’ 1/(denominator) is d/(dÂ² + RÂ²).

So U becomes (1/2) * k * (- RÂ² qÂ²/d) * [ d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) ) ].

The d's cancel out, so U = (1/2) k (- RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²) â†’ U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (dÂ² + RÂ²).

Looking at the options, none of them have R squared in the numerator. Option A has d, and option C has RÂ² in the numerator but the denominator is (dÂ² - R^2) and a 1/2 factor. So this suggests I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps the image charge method is not applicable here because the sphere is grounded. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's potential energy can be found using the formula for the potential energy between two charges, considering the image charge as another charge. So U = (1/2) k q q' / r.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the presence of the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the charge's position is due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface, but since the sphere is grounded, the +q flows away, leaving the sphere with -q. So the potential at the charge's position is due to -q, located at the center.

So the potential at the charge q's location is V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy U would be q * V = -k qÂ² / d. But this isn't one of the options either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for similar problems or standard formulas.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a charge q placed outside a conducting sphere of radius R is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2), assuming d > R. Wait, that's option C: U = -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2).

But why would that be the case? Let me think about energy. When you bring a charge q near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere do work in bringing the charge closer, and the potential energy is stored in the system as the charge and the induced charges' configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere. The calculation might involve integrating the electric field of the induced charges.

But without knowing the exact distribution of the induced charges, it's hard to integrate. But perhaps we can model the induced charges as a point charge at the center of the sphere.

So the potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q Q_induced / d, where Q_induced is the induced charge on the sphere.

But earlier, I found that Q_induced = - R q/(d - R).

So substituting, U = (1/2) k q * (- R q/(d - R)) / d = - (1/2) k R qÂ² / [ d (d - R) ) ].

Wait, that doesn't match any of the options either. So perhaps I'm missing something in the approach.

Wait, another thought: the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charge Q must cancel on the sphere's surface.

The potential due to q at the sphere's surface is V_q = k q / (d + R), assuming the charge is placed outside along the same line. The potential due to the induced charge Q is V_Q = k Q / R. So V_q + V_Q = 0 â†’ Q = - (R q) / (d + R).

Wait, that's different from before. So Q = - R q/(d + R).

Now, the potential at the charge q's location due to Q is V = k Q / d = k (- R q/(d + R)) ) / d = - k R q / [ d (d + R) ) ].

The potential energy U is then q * V = - k R qÂ² / [ d (d + R) ) ].

Hmm, this expression is still not matching any of the options. Option A is - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²), which is different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy stored in the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges are -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface, but since it's grounded, the outer surface's +q flows away, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

But then the potential energy would be the energy due to the charge q and the -q on the sphere.

The potential energy U between two point charges is (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. So here, q1 is q, q2 is -q, and r is d.

So U = (1/2) k q (-q) / d = - (1/2) k qÂ² / d.

But again, this doesn't match any options provided. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k qÂ² d/(dÂ² + RÂ²). If I factor out, d/(dÂ² + RÂ²) can be written as 1/(d + RÂ²/d), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the induced charge as a point charge at the center, but the potential energy is U = - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2). Which is option C.

But why would that be the case? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the potential energy between the charge q and the induced image charge is given by that formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. I think I'm getting stuck here because I'm unsure about the exact method to calculate the potential energy in this scenario.

Wait, another way to think about it: the potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. When you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. The work done in bringing q to its position is the potential energy.

But without knowing the exact distribution of the induced charges, it's challenging. However, based on the options and the image charge method, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, earlier calculation using the image charge gave U = - (1/2) (k RÂ² qÂ²) / (d^2 + R^2), which doesn't match any option. But option C is U = -(1/2) k qÂ² R^2/(d^2 - R^2). So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance is R^2/d, and the distance between q and q' is d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So then, the potential energy U would be (1/2) k (q q') / r, where q' is the image charge.

So q' = - (R^2 q)/d.

r = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- R^2 q/d) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ].

Simplify denominator: [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] â†’ 1/(denominator) is d/(d^2 - R^2).

So U = (1/2) * k * [ (- R^2 q^2 ) / d ) ] * [ d/(d^2 - R^2) ) ].

The d's cancel: U = (1/2) * k * (- R^2 q^2 ) / (d^2 - R^2 ).

Which gives U = - (1/2) k R^2 q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 ), which is option C.

Wait, that's the same as option C. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its surface potential is zero. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. The induced charges redistribute such that the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Sphere**:  
   The charge \( q \) induces a charge of \( -q \) on the inner surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface remains neutral, and the net charge on the sphere is \( -q \).

2. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the sphere. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy can be derived using the method of images or by considering the energy stored in the system due to the induced charge distribution.

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   The method of images simplifies the calculation by modeling the induced charges as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center of the sphere, on the opposite side of the sphere from \( q \). The total potential energy is then given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q q'}{r},
   \]
   where \( q' = -\frac{R^2}{d} q \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \) is the distance between \( q \) and the image charge.

4. **Substitution and Simplification**:  
   Substituting \( q' \) and \( r \) into the formula for \( U \), we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \left(-\frac{R^2}{d} q\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option C**.
