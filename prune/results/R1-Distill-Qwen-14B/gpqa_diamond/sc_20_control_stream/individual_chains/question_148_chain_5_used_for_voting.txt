Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. Let's see what the different parts of the question say.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) is 31.96%. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because fluorine usually has oxidation states of -1. Hmm, maybe oF refers to something else. Oh wait, maybe it's the oxygen-freezing point or something else? Or perhaps it's the percentage composition? Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%", so maybe that's the mass percent of fluorine in A2. Oh, because A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So, when A1 breaks down, it produces A2 and fluorine gas. So, the fluorine in A2 would have a certain percentage. Let me think about that.

Next, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is a compound of F and Y where Y is in a high oxidation state.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So, perhaps A3 is YF, or another fluorine compound.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, it produces A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, A5 might be a salt that breaks down into something else when water is present.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are from 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.

Let me try to figure out what each compound could be.

Starting with A1: it's a binary compound (so Y and F), bright red, decomposes into A2 and F2. Since fluorine is a diatomic molecule (F2), that makes sense. What binary fluorides are bright red? I think of fluorine-containing compounds. For example, ClF3 is a pale yellow liquid, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic substance. Oh wait, BrF3 is a dark brown liquid, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: when a compound decomposes into F2, perhaps it's a fluoride being broken down. For example, if A1 is a higher fluoride that releases F2. The decomposition reaction would be something like YF_x → YF_y + F2. But the exact reaction isn't clear yet.

But A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is inert, but in the presence of strong oxidizing agents, it can react. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so A1 might be a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state, making it a strong oxidizing agent.

What about the decomposition? If A1 → A2 + F2, then A2 is likely another fluoride. Let's say A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition gives YF4 and F2. Wait, but that doesn't fit because F2 is a product. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF2, which upon decomposition gives YF and F2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the oF is 31.96% in A2. Wait, if that's the mass percent of fluorine in A2, let's calculate the possible formula.

So, let's assume A2 is YF_n. Mass percent of F is (n * 19) / (atomic mass of Y + n * 19) ) * 100 = 31.96%.

But without knowing Y, it's tricky. Maybe Y is something with a high atomic mass. Let's think about possible Y elements.

Wait, another approach: since all are binary compounds, Y must be a single element. Let's think about elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, chlorine forms ClF3, ClF5; bromine has BrF3, BrF5. Alternatively, maybe sulfur? Or another element.

But wait, another angle: when Y is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, producing A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that's not very stable in water.

Wait, if A4 is a solution, it's probably a fluoride in solution. Adding Y (the element) in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution would form a new compound. Maybe a double displacement reaction?

Wait, the problem says 'hot colorless concentrated solution of A4'. Concentrated solutions of fluorides are often colorless, unless they're colored ions. For instance, NH4F is colorless in solution.

So, when Y is added, perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. For example, if A4 is NH4F, adding Y (like Si) might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alkali metal. Wait, but Y is part of the binary compounds, so it's the other element besides F.

Wait, maybe Y is an element that can form multiple fluorides, and when it's added to a solution of another fluoride, a reaction occurs. For example, if Y is Cl, and A4 is NaF, adding Cl in some form... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought. Let's see. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 is YF_m, where m is the number of fluorines attached.

So, putting it all together, perhaps Y is a group 13 element, like boron, aluminum, etc., because they form multiple fluorides. For example, boron forms BF3 and BF4^- (in compounds), but that's not a binary compound. Alternatively, maybe Y is phosphorus. Wait, phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, etc.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about each part again.

A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. The decomposition reaction might be something like:

2 YF3 → YF4 + F2

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's YF4 decomposing into YF2 and F2. Let's compute the fluorine content.

Wait, but for A2, the fluorine is 31.96%. Let's assume A2 is YF_n.

So, (n * 19) / (atomic mass Y + 19n) = 0.3196.

Let’s rearrange: 19n = 0.3196 (Y +19n)

19n = 0.3196 Y + 6.0724n

19n -6.0724n = 0.3196 Y

12.9276n = 0.3196 Y

Y = (12.9276 / 0.3196) n

Calculate that: 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5.

So Y ≈40.5 * n.

Hmm, possible n values are 1,2,3,4,5, etc. Let's try n=1: Y≈40.5. That's close to the atomic mass of titanium (≈47.867). Or maybe another element.

n=2: Y≈81. Hmm, that's close to the atomic mass of lead (Pb is about 207, so no), or maybe something else. Wait, 81 is close to the atomic mass of yttrium (≈88.91), but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe Y is germanium (~72.63), but 81 is higher.

Wait, perhaps n=3: Y≈121.5. That could be around the atomic mass of iodine (I is about 126.9). Hmm, close.

n=4: Y≈162. Which is close to the atomic mass of tin (Sn is about 118.71 for Sn-120, but more around 118.71 on average). Maybe not exactly, but perhaps Y is Sn.

Wait, but let's think about which elements form multiple fluorides. For example, tin forms SnF2, SnF4.

But wait, let's see. Let's try Y=Sn (atomic mass ~118.71).

If n=3, Y would be 40.5 *3=121.5, but Sn is ~118.71, so close but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe Y is lead? Lead's atomic mass is about 207.2.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the equation was Y = (12.9276 /0.3196) *n ≈40.5 *n.

If Y is about 118.71 (Sn), then:

118.71 =40.5 *n → n≈ 2.93. So n=3.

So A2 would be SnF3.

Then, the fluorine mass percent in SnF3 is (3 *19)/(118.71 +3*19) =57/(118.71+57)=57/175.71≈32.4%.

Wait, the given value is 31.96%, which is close, within rounding. So Y could be Sn, and A2 is SnF3.

So A1 is a compound that upon decomposition gives SnF3 and F2.

So the decomposition reaction would be:

A1 → SnF3 + F2.

Wait, what's A1? Let's think. If A1 is decomposing into SnF3 and F2, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride. Like SnF4 decomposing?

Wait, SnF4 is tin(IV) fluoride. If SnF4 decomposes, but how? SnF4 is more stable than SnF3, so decomposition might not occur. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a binary compound like SnF2, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound. Wait, when SnF4 is heated, does it decompose? Let me think. No, I think SnF4 is quite stable.

Alternatively, maybe A1 isn't a tin compound. Let me think of another Y.

Wait, perhaps Y is lead (Pb). Pb's atomic mass is about 207.2.

If Y is Pb, then for n=1: Y=40.5*1=40.5, Pb is 207, so no. For n=5: Y=40.5 *5=202.5. Close to Pb's 207.2. So, if n=5:

(5 *19)/(207.2 + 5*19) =95 / (207.2 + 95)=95/296.2 ≈32.08%. That's close to 31.96%. So Y could be Pb, and A2 is PbF5.

So if A1 decomposes into PbF5 and F2. What would A1 be? Maybe PbF6? Or another higher fluoride. But I'm not sure if PbF6 is a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is PbF4, which upon decomposition gives PbF5 and F2?

Wait, let's think about the decomposition equation. Let's say PbF4 → PbF5 + F2. But PbF4 is less likely to decompose than PbF5, as PbF5 is the higher fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a different compound, not a Pb fluoride. Maybe another element.

Wait, let's try Y as chlorine. Chlorine's atomic mass is about 35.45.

If Y=35.45, then from Y=40.5 *n → 35.45≈40.5 *n → n≈0.875. Not a whole number, so that's not possible.

How about Y is iodine (I, ~126.9). Let's see:

If Y=126.9, then n=126.9 /40.5≈3.13. Close to 3.

So, n=3.

Then, A2 would be IF3.

Fluorine mass in IF3: (3*19)/(126.9 +57) =57/(183.9) ≈31.0%. Hmm, the given is 31.96%, which is a bit higher, but close. So Y could be iodine, and A2 is IF3.

Then, A1 would be decomposing into IF3 and F2. So, perhaps A1 is IF5? Because IF5 decomposes into IF3 and F2 when heated. Let me think: the reaction would be 2 IF5 → 2 IF3 + F2. Hmm, does that make sense?

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is I2F7, but I don't think that's a thing. Let me check. Iodine forms IF3, IF5, I2F7 is a thing? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is another compound.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to think of another approach.

The decomposition of A1 gives A2 and F2. So, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride than A2. For example, if A2 is YF3, then A1 might be YF5, but that's just a guess.

Wait, another point: A1 is a bright-red substance. Iodine's fluorides are usually dark. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal fluoride. Wait, fluorine compounds with transition metals are often colored. For example, MnF3 is dark green. Wait, maybe it's another element.

Alternatively, considering that A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon's oxidation reactions typically involve fluorine. For example, XeF4 and XeF6 are formed when xenon reacts with fluorine. So, if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe it's a compound like YF5, where Y is a highly electronegative element.

Wait, another angle: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 is a fluoride, like YF. Then, A3 can also react with xenon. So, maybe YF is a weaker oxidizing agent than A1, but still can react with xenon under certain conditions.

So, putting this together, perhaps Y is an element that forms multiple fluorides, such as iodine, chlorine, or maybe even sulfur.

Wait, sulfur forms SF4 and SF6. Let me check the fluorine percentage for SF4.

SF4: S is ~32.07, F is 19 each. So, (4*19)/(32.07 + 4*19) =76/(32.07+76)=76/108.07≈70.3%. That's higher than 31.96%, so that's not A2.

Hmm, maybe not sulfur.

Wait, what about molybdenum? Mo can form MoF6. But I'm not sure about the fluorine percentage.

Alternatively, let's think about the decomposition of A1. Suppose A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let's see what that would mean.

Equation: YF5 → YF3 + F2.

But that doesn't balance. Let's balance it:

2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2.

Yes, that works. So 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2.

So, in this case, A2 would be YF3.

The fluorine percentage in YF3 is (3 *19)/(Y +57).

We know this equals 31.96%.

So,

(57) / (Y +57) = 0.3196.

Solving:

57 = 0.3196 (Y +57)

57 / 0.3196 ≈ Y +57

57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178.2.

So, Y +57 ≈178.2 → Y≈121.2.

Which element has an atomic mass around 121.2? Let's see: Te is about 127.6, I is ~126.9, S is 32, Cl is 35.5, Br is 79.9, etc. Wait, 121 is close to the atomic mass of Sn (tin is around 118.71). Hmm, 118.71 is close to 121.2. Maybe it's an approximate value.

So Y would be Sn (tin), and A2 is SnF3.

Then A1 is SnF5, which decomposes into SnF3 and F2.

So,

2 SnF5 → 2 SnF3 + F2.

Yes, that's a balanced equation.

So, Y is Sn.

Now, let's think about the other parts.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, SnF5 is a strong oxidizing agent, which can oxidize xenon to XeF2 or XeF4 or XeF6. I'm not sure about the specifics.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is Sn, so A3 could be SnF2 or SnF4. But if A3 can also interact with xenon, perhaps it's a weaker oxidizing agent than A1, but still capable of some reaction.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, it produces A5. Y is Sn, so adding Sn to A4's solution.

What's A4? It's a binary compound of F and Y (Sn). So A4 would be SnF_x.

If A4 is a solution, it's probably a soluble fluoride. Let's say A4 is SnF4, which is soluble in water. When Sn (elemental) is added to SnF4 solution, perhaps it displaces something. But SnF4 is already a tin compound.

Wait, but if A4 is a solution, it's probably a different tin fluoride. Let's think: SnF2 is sparingly soluble, while SnF4 is more soluble. If A4 is SnF4 solution, adding Sn metal in a 1:1 molar ratio.

Wait, the reaction could be Sn + SnF4 → something. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a different compound, like a complex fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different salt. Wait, but the problem states that A4 is a binary compound of F and Y. So A4 is YF_x, which is SnF_x.

Wait, perhaps A4 is (SnF4). Let's assume that. Then, adding Sn metal to SnF4 solution:

Sn + SnF4 → ?

But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a salt of another acid. Wait, maybe if A4 is a solution of a different tin compound, like a complex.

Alternatively, perhaps when Sn is added to a solution of something like KSnF6 (a potassium tin fluoride), but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution of A4 is a different compound, perhaps a mixture or a complex.

Another thought: when Sn is added to a solution of SnF4, perhaps it reduces something. For example, in acidic conditions, SnF4 can act as an oxidizing agent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: when you add Y (Sn) to a solution of A4 (a Sn fluoride) in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps it forms another compound, like SnF2.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let's think about the products.

A5 is formed, which decomposes in water into two substances. If A5 is a hydrolysis product, perhaps it's a salt that breaks down into HF and another acid, or maybe into two different compounds.

Wait, perhaps when A4 is a solution of SnF4 and Sn is added, the reaction produces SnF2 and another product.

Let me think of a possible reaction:

SnF4 + Sn → SnF2 + something.

But that's not balanced. Let's write it out:

a SnF4 + b Sn → c SnF2 + d something.

Looking for a balanced equation.

Let me assign a=1, b=1.

SnF4 + Sn → SnF2 + ?

So, on the left: 1 Sn, 4 F.

On the right: 1 Sn in SnF2, so 2 F.

So, the F needs to balance. Maybe another product involving F.

Wait, perhaps F- is released as HF? Or maybe F2 is produced, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

SnF4 + Sn → SnF2 + 2 HF.

Wait, let's check the atoms.

Left: 1 Sn, 4 F, 1 Sn.

Right: 1 Sn, 2 F, 2 H, 2 F (from 2 HF).

Wait, but the H comes from water. So maybe the reaction is:

SnF4 + Sn + 2 H2O → SnF2 + 2 HF + something.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it’s:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + 2 F^-.

But that seems unlikely because F^- would require a base.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + 2 F^-.

But in solution, F^- would come from SnF4 dissociating.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces SnF2 and F2 gas. Let me check:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + F2.

Let's balance the atoms.

Sn: 1 +1 → 2 → 2 on the right (2 SnF2). So that's balanced.

F: 4 + 0 → 4 (2 SnF2 contributes 4 F) and F2 has 2 F. So total F on right is 4 + 2 =6. Left has 4. Doesn't balance.

So, to balance F:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + (something with F).

Wait, perhaps:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + 2 F^-.

But that would require an acidic solution. So in H+ presence:

SnF4 + Sn + 2 H2O → 2 SnF2 + 2 HF + something else.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + 2 F^-.

But in this case, the F^- would pair with H+ from water to form HF.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + 2 F^-.

But then, the charge must balance. Left side: neutral. Right side: 2 SnF2 (neutral) and 2 F^- (charge -2). So to balance, perhaps another product is formed, like H2.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

SnF4 + Sn → 2 SnF2 + F2.

But F2 has 2 F atoms. Let's count F:

Left: 4 F.

Right: 2 *2 =4 F (from SnF2) and 2 F from F2. So total 6 F on the right. Not balanced.

So, perhaps the reaction isn't straightforward. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Let me think about A5. A5 is formed when Y is added to A4's solution. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is a weak acid or a salt that hydrolyzes.

Another possibility: if A4 is a solution of SnF4, and Y (Sn) is added, maybe it forms a precipitate. For example, SnF4 is soluble, but adding Sn metal might not precipitate anything. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound, like a complex fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think of possible binary fluorides of tin.

Known tin fluorides include SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. Wait, SnF6 is a thing? I'm not sure. Let me think: Sn can form +2 and +4 oxidation states.

Wait, if A4 is SnF4, which is soluble, then adding Sn metal (in a 1:1 ratio) would perhaps not react because SnF4 is already in solution. Maybe it's a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different salt, but the problem says it's a binary compound of F and Y (Sn), so it must be SnF_x.

Wait, another angle. Let's think of the final part: A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So when A5 is added to water, it breaks into two products. For example, if A5 is a salt like CaCO3, it would decompose into CaO and CO2. But what kind of fluoride would do that?

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a fluorohydrin or something that releases HF when it decomposes.

Another possibility: A5 could be a metal fluoride that reacts with water. For example, if A5 is CaF2, it's insoluble in water, but maybe another compound.

Wait, SnF2 is sparingly soluble in water. If A5 is SnF2, then adding water wouldn't decompose it much. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a complex, like [SnF6]^2- which would decompose in water to form SnF4 and HF or something similar.

Alternatively, think of the decomposition in water. If A5 is something like SnF4·nH2O, which upon dehydration forms a different compound, but I'm not sure.

This part is getting a bit unclear. Maybe I should focus more on the problem and the options given.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

Earlier, I thought Y is Sn, so A4 would be a binary fluoride of Sn.

If A4 is SnF4, its molecular weight would be Sn (118.71) + 4*19=118.71 +76=194.71. So about 195 g/mol. That would fall into option C (160-180). But wait, 195 is above 180, so it wouldn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, no, if the options are ranges, 195 would be above 180, so option C is 160-180, so 195 is not in that range. So perhaps A4 is another compound.

Alternatively, if A4 is SnF2, molecular weight is 118.71 + 38=156.71. So about 157 g/mol, which falls into option D (110-130) no, wait 157 is higher than 130. So option C is 160-180, so 157 is just below. So maybe A4 is SnF2, which has a molecular weight of ~157 g/mol, which is just under 160. So the option C starts at 160, so it's just below. So that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A4 is SnF6. Let's calculate that. Sn is 118.71, F is 19*6=114. So total 232.71. That's around 233 g/mol. That would fall into option B (220-240), but I don't think SnF6 is a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's not a simple fluoride.

Alternatively, if Y is not Sn but another element. Let's think again.

Earlier, I considered Y as I (iodine), but let's recalculate.

If Y is iodine (I, ~126.9), and A2 is IF3, the molecular weight of IF3 is 126.9 + 3*19 =126.9 +57=183.9 g/mol. So that's around 184. So, if A4 is another iodide fluoride, like IF5, molecular weight is 126.9 +5*19=126.9+95=221.9, which is about 222. That would fall into option B (220-240).

But earlier, I thought Y was Sn because the fluorine percentage fit better. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: the five binary compounds of Y and F. For Y to have five binary compounds, Y must have a valency that allows for five different fluoride formulas. 

Which elements form five or more binary fluorides? Let's think.

Iodine forms IF3, IF5, I2F7. Wait, that's three. Maybe more.

Chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three.

Wait, perhaps another element. Lead (Pb) forms PbF2, PbF4, PbF6. That's three.

Wait, maybe phosphorus? P forms PF3, PF5. That's two.

Wait, perhaps molybdenum? MoF6 is a thing, but I'm not sure about others.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states, allowing for more fluorides. For example, tin can form SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. That's three, but the question says five. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not a main group element but something else.

Wait, perhaps Y is fluorine itself? No, because it's a binary compound with F, so Y would have to be another element.

Alternatively, maybe Y is oxygen? No, because it's a binary compound with F, but O and F form OF2 and OF2 is a thing, but that's only one compound.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is a noble gas? Unlikely, as noble gases don't form many compounds, but Xe can form XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. That's three. Not enough for five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a lanthanide element, which can form multiple fluorides. Let me think: For example, lanthanum forms LaF3, but that's one.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the possible options again.

The problem states that five binary compounds are known. Let's think of an element with five possible binary fluorides.

Wait, perhaps Y is sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6, but that's only two. Maybe other fluorides exist that I'm not aware of. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine, which forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three. Not enough.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states. For example, iron can form FeF2 and FeF3, but that's only two. Maybe another metal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a group 14 element. Let's see: tin can form SnF2, SnF4, SnF6. That's three. So perhaps not five.

Wait, maybe Y is a group 15 element, like phosphorus, which forms PF3 and PF5. Two compounds. Not enough.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the decomposition part. If Y is an element that forms five binary fluorides, perhaps it's an element like chlorine, which has ClF, ClF3, ClF5. So three. Not five.

Wait, maybe it's a different element. Let me think of another approach.

If Y is iodine, and A4 is a binary compound of I and F, let's say I2F7, which has a molecular weight of 2*126.9 +7*19=253.8 +133=386.8. That's way above the options.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is IF5. Its molecular weight is 126.9 +5*19=126.9 +95=221.9. So 222 g/mol, which falls into option B (220-240).

But earlier, when Y was Sn, A4 would be SnF4, which is about 195 g/mol, not matching the options.

Wait, the options for A4's molecular weight are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130.

So, if A4's molecular weight is around 195, none of the options fit. So perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is lead (Pb), which has a higher atomic mass. Pb is about 207.2.

If A2 is PbF5, then the fluorine percentage is (5*19)/(207.2 +5*19) =95/(207.2+95)=95/296.2≈32.1%, which is close to the given 31.96%.

So, Y is Pb, A2 is PbF5.

Then, A1 would be a higher fluoride. For example, PbF6. But does PbF6 exist? I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is PbF4, which upon decomposition gives PbF5 and F2.

But how?

Let me think: 2 PbF4 → 2 PbF5 + F2.

But PbF4 is more stable than PbF5. Wait, perhaps the decomposition is the reverse.

Wait, maybe it's PbF5 that decomposes into PbF3 and F2. Let's calculate the fluorine percentage for PbF3.

(3*19)/(207.2 +57)=57/(264.2)=21.6%. Not close to the 31.96%.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track again.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let me think. If Y is bismuth (Bi, ~208.98), and the formula is BiF3.

Fluorine percentage: (3*19)/(208.98+57)=57/(265.98)=21.43%. Not matching 31.96%.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is germanium (Ge, ~72.63). Let's compute for A2.

If A2 is GeF4, then fluorine percentage is (4*19)/(72.63 +76)=76/(148.63)=51.3%. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps A2 is GeF2. Then, (2*19)/(72.63+38)=38/(110.63)=34.36%. Close to 31.96%.

So, Y could be Ge, and A2 is GeF2.

Then, the decomposition of A1 would produce GeF2 and F2.

What would A1 be? Maybe GeF4.

So, decomposition reaction: GeF4 → GeF2 + F2.

But how? Let's write the balanced equation:

2 GeF4 → 2 GeF2 + F2.

Yes, that works.

So, Y is Ge.

Then, considering A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 would be GeF, but that's not a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps another fluoride.

Wait, but Ge forms GeF2, GeF4. So, initial fluorinating would give GeF2, perhaps. Then, A3 is GeF2.

But the problem said A3 can also interact with xenon. So, maybe GeF2 is a reactant with Xe.

Then, when Y (Ge) is added to a hot concentrated solution of A4 (GeF_x), it produces A5.

Assuming A4 is GeF4 (molecular weight 72.63 + 4*19 =72.63 +76=148.63 g/mol). That falls into option D (110-130), but 148 is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, if A4 is GeF6, molecular weight is 72.63 +6*19=72.63+114=186.63. That's around 187 g/mol, which falls into option C (160-180). But GeF6 is not a known compound, as far as I'm aware. Most group 14 elements form up to +4 oxidation states, so GeF4 is the likely compound.

Wait, but if A4 is GeF4, its molecular weight is ~148.6, which is in option D (110-130). But 148 is above 130, so it doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution, A5 is formed. So, if A4 is a solution of YF_x, adding Y would form YF_y.

But without knowing the exact compounds, it's challenging.

Perhaps, given the time I've spent, I should make an educated guess based on the earlier calculations.

Earlier, when Y was Sn, A4 was SnF4 with molecular weight ~195. That doesn't fit any option except perhaps none. But the closest option higher than 195 is option B (220-240). But 195 is not in that range.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the fluorine percentage calculation.

Given that in A2, oF (fluorine mass percent) is 31.96%.

If A2 is YF3, then:

(3*19)/(Y +57) = 0.3196 → 57 =0.3196(Y +57)

Compute:

57 =0.3196 Y + 18.07 → 57-18.07=0.3196 Y → 38.93=0.3196 Y → Y=38.93 /0.3196 ≈121.8.

So Y is about 121.8. The element with atomic mass ~122 is Te (tellurium, ~127.6) or I (126.9). So Y is probably tellurium or iodine.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. If Y is about 122, that's close to tellurium (Te, ~127.6). So, Y could be Te.

So, A2 is TeF3.

Then, the fluorine percentage is (3*19)/(127.6 +57)=57/(184.6)=31.0%. Close to 31.96%, so that's a possible fit.

So, Y is Te.

A1 is a binary compound of Te and F, which decomposes into TeF3 and F2.

So, possible reaction: 2 TeF5 → 2 TeF3 + F2.

Because 2 TeF5 would decompose into 2 TeF3 and F2.

So, A1 is TeF5.

Now, let me think about the other parts.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Te). So, perhaps A3 is TeF, but that's not a known compound. More likely, A3 could be TeF3 or TeF5, but the question says it's obtained by fluorinating Y, which would be Te → TeF_x.

Alternatively, perhaps A3 is TeF3, but that's a decomposition product.

Wait, maybe A3 is TeF7 or another higher fluoride.

But TeF7 is a thing? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A3 is TeF3, which could react with xenon.

Then, when Y (Te) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution, which is a binary compound of Te and F, it forms A5.

If A4 is a solution of TeF4, adding Te metal would perhaps reduce it to TeF2.

So, reaction: Te + TeF4 → 2 TeF2.

But that would require balancing:

Te + TeF4 → 2 TeF2.

On the left: 2 Te, 4 F.

On the right: 2 Te, 4 F. So it's balanced.

So, A5 is TeF2.

Then, in water, A5 (TeF2) decomposes into two substances. What could that be? Perhaps TeO and HF, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it hydrolyzes to form HTeO3 and HF, but Te isn't typically in +4 or +6 oxidation states in such compounds. Alternatively, maybe it forms H2TeO4 or something else. I'm not certain, but perhaps that's beyond the point.

Now, the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is TeF4, its molecular weight is Te (127.6) + 4*19=127.6 +76=203.6 g/mol. That falls into option B (220-240), no, wait 203.6 is between 180 and 220. So option B is 220-240, which is higher than 203.6. So it doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is another Te fluoride. Let me think: TeF6 would have a molecular weight of 127.6 +6*19=127.6+114=241.6 g/mol, which is in option B (220-240).

But does TeF6 exist? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is TeF2, which has a molecular weight of 127.6 +38=165.6 g/mol. That would fall into option C (160-180).

So, assuming A4 is TeF2, molecular weight ~165.6, which fits option C.

But earlier, when A4 is TeF4, it's 203.6, which isn't fitting any option except perhaps none.

Another possibility: perhaps A4 is TeF3, which has a molecular weight of 127.6 +57= 184.6 g/mol. That's in option C (160-180). Wait, 184.6 is above 180, so it's just above option C's upper limit.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. But given the options, perhaps the correct molecular weight of A4 is around 184 (if A4 is TeF3), which would fall into option C (160-180).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption and Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the molecular weight in the options. The options suggest that the correct answer is C) 160-180.

From earlier, when Y was Sn, A4 would be SnF4 (195 g/mol), which isn't in any option. But when Y is Te, and A4 is TeF2 (165.6), which is in option C.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine and element Y, based on the given information. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Initial Assumptions**:
   - Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F2).
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also interact with xenon.
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - The decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2 suggests A1 is a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower fluoride.
   - The fluorine mass percentage in A2 is given as 31.96%. Assuming A2 is YFₙ, the formula for fluorine percentage is:
     \[
     \text{Fluorine percentage} = \frac{n \cdot 19}{Y + n \cdot 19} \cdot 100 = 31.96\%
     \]
     Solving for \(Y\), it was determined that \(Y \approx 121.8\), which corresponds to tellurium (Te, atomic mass ~127.6).

3. **Assigning Compounds**:
   - A2 is identified as TeF₃, as the fluorine percentage calculation aligns with the given value (31.96%).
   - A1 is likely TeF₅, which decomposes into TeF₃ and F₂:
     \[
     2 \, \text{TeF}_5 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{TeF}_3 + \text{F}_2
     \]
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Te), likely forming TeF₇ or another higher fluoride, though details were unclear.

4. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of Te and fluorine. Considering the decomposition reaction and the formation of A5, A4 is likely TeF₂ or TeF₄.
   - The molecular weights of possible candidates were calculated:
     - TeF₂: \(127.6 + 2 \cdot 19 = 165.6 \, \text{g/mol}\)
     - TeF₄: \(127.6 + 4 \cdot 19 = 203.6 \, \text{g/mol}\)
   - Among these, TeF₂ (\(165.6 \, \text{g/mol}\)) falls within the range 160–180, corresponding to option C.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the molecular weight of A4 is most consistent with the range 160–180.
