Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radii. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If a star is more massive but has the same radius, does that mean it's younger or in a different stage? But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I vaguely remember is that the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, I think it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the probability P is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital distance. But wait, actually, the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's often approximated as P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else? Or maybe it's P ≈ (R_star / a) * (1), because the planet's size is negligible compared to the star. So maybe P ≈ (R_star / a) * sin(i), where i is the inclination. But wait, sin(i) averages out over all possible inclinations, so the probability is proportional to R_star / (a * (1 + something)). Oh wait, I think the correct expression is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (some function of the orbital distance and star's radius). Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The transit probability formula is given by (R* + R_p) / a, where R* is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital distance). But since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's often approximated as R* / a. But wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Let me recall the exact formula. Oh right, the probability is (R* / a) * ( (1 + R_p/R*) ) / (1 + (R_p/R*)) )? Hmm, no, that seems off.

Wait, I think I mixed it up. The formula for the transit probability is ( (R_* + R_p) / a ) multiplied by (something else) but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*/ a) multiplied by (some function based on the star's size and the planet's orbit). Oh wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the areas where the planet's orbital plane could be edge-on enough to cause a transit. The probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_*) ), but again, since R_p << R_*, it's approximately (R_* / a).

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_* / a) * ( (R_* + R_p) / R_* ), which simplifies to (R_* + R_p)/a. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's about R_* / a.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the transit probability formula in my memory. Oh right, the transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*) ), but since R_p is much smaller, it's approximately R_*/(a). So the probability is proportional to (R_*/a).

But wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: the transit probability is also related to the orbital period. Because a shorter period means the planet is closer to the star, which would make the probability lower because a is smaller? Or wait, no. Let's think about it: a is the semi-major axis. If the period is shorter, according to Kepler's third law, a is smaller. Because P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). So for a shorter period, a is smaller.

Wait, but the transit probability formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a. So, a smaller a would make the probability higher, because the denominator is smaller. But wait, if a is smaller, then (R_* + R_p)/a is larger. So higher probability.

Wait, but wait, no. No, Kepler's third law says that for a star of mass M, the period P is related to a by P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So, for a given mass, a shorter P means a smaller a.

So, for a planet with a shorter period, a is smaller. So (R_* / a) is larger. That would mean a higher transit probability.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star. In this case, both stars have the same radius, R*. So if a is smaller, (R_* / a) is larger, so higher probability.

So for Planet_1, which has a shorter period (a1 < a2?), because period is three times shorter. Let's think about the masses of the stars. Oh, Planet_1's star is more massive. So let's compute a for each planet using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form: a^3 = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So a ≈ cube root( (G M P²)/(4 π²) ). Since G and 4π² are constants, a is proportional to cube root( M * P² ). 

So if M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 is proportional to cube_root( (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )² )

= cube_root( 2 M2 * P2² / 9 )

= cube_root( (2/9) * M2 P2² )

Similarly, a2 is proportional to cube_root(M2 P2² )

So a1 = a2 * cube_root( (2/9) / 1 )

But cube_root(2/9) is the same as (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close.

So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2.

Wait, the exact value: (2/9) = 2/(3^2), so cube root is 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ≈ (1.26) / (2.08) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Now, transit probability is P = (R_* / a ) * something. Since both stars have the same radius (R*1 = R*2 = R*), then P1 ≈ R* / a1 and P2 ≈ R* / a2.

So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 is about 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

But wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Let me think again. a1 is smaller than a2, so R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So P1 is larger than P2. Which would mean that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but the question says the researchers chose to observe the one with higher probability. So the correct choice would be that Planet_1 is preferred because it has higher P.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25x higher.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5x.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7x.

So my calculation suggests that P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2. So option C says Planet_1 is preferred because it's ~1.65 times higher. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the a correctly? Let me redo the Kepler's law calculation.

a^3 = (G M P^2 )/(4 π^2 )

So a is proportional to (M P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P2^2 /9 ) = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

a2^3 = M2 P2^2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

(2/9) = 0.2222, cube root is ~0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

Thus, a1 is about 0.606 a2. So a2 is approximately 1.65 a1.

So when computing P = R* / a.

Since R* is same for both.

P1 = R* / a1.

P2 = R* / a2.

So P1 / P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

So yes, P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, as it's 1.65 times more likely to transit.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law: 

\[
a^3 \propto M P^2,
\]

where \( M \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
a_1 \propto (M_1 P_1^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3}.
\]

\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3}}{(M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, no. No, Kepler's third law says that for a star of mass M, the period P is related to a by P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So, for a given mass, a shorter P means a smaller a.

So, for a planet with a shorter period, a is smaller. So (R_* / a) is larger. That would mean a higher transit probability.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star. In this case, both stars have the same radius, R*. So if a is smaller, (R_* / a) is larger, so higher probability.

So for Planet_1, which has a shorter period (a1 < a2?), because period is three times shorter. Let's think about the masses of the stars. Oh, Planet_1's star is more massive. So let's compute a for each planet using Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form: a^3 = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²). Since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So a ≈ cube root( (G M P²)/(4 π²) ). Since G and 4π² are constants, a is proportional to cube root( M * P² ). 

So if M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 is proportional to cube_root( (2 M2) * ( (P2/3) )² )

= cube_root( 2 M2 * P2² / 9 )

= cube_root( (2/9) * M2 P2² )

Similarly, a2 is proportional to cube_root(M2 P2² )

So a1 = a2 * cube_root( (2/9) / 1 )

But cube_root(2/9) is the same as (2/9)^(1/3). Let me compute that. 2/9 is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close.

So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2.

Wait, the exact value: (2/9) = 2/(3^2), so cube root is 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ≈ (1.26) / (2.08) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Now, transit probability is P = (R_* / a ) * something. Since both stars have the same radius (R*1 = R*2 = R*), then P1 ≈ R* / a1 and P2 ≈ R* / a2.

So P1/P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

Since a1 is about 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

But wait, I'm not sure I got that right. Let me think again. a1 is smaller than a2, so R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2. So P1 is larger than P2. Which would mean that Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but the question says the researchers chose to observe the one with higher probability. So the correct choice would be that Planet_1 is preferred because it has higher P.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25x higher.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5x.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65x.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7x.

So my calculation suggests that P1 is approximately 1.65 times P2. So option C says Planet_1 is preferred because it's ~1.65 times higher. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the a correctly? Let me redo the Kepler's law calculation.

a^3 = (G M P^2 )/(4 π^2 )

So a is proportional to (M P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for Planet_1: M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = (2 M2) * (P2^2 /9 ) = (2/9) M2 P2^2.

a2^3 = M2 P2^2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

(2/9) = 0.2222, cube root is ~0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

Thus, a1 is about 0.606 a2. So a2 is approximately 1.65 a1.

So when computing P = R* / a.

Since R* is same for both.

P1 = R* / a1.

P2 = R* / a2.

So P1 / P2 = (R*/a1) / (R*/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/(0.606) ≈ 1.65.

So yes, P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1, as it's 1.65 times more likely to transit.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law: 

\[
a^3 \propto M P^2,
\]

where \( M \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)).

Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
a_1 \propto (M_1 P_1^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2)^{1/3} = (2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3}.
\]

\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \), we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{(2M_2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3}}{(M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \). Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
