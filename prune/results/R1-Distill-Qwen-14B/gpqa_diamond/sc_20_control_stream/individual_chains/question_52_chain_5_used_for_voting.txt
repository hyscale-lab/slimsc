Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to unpack it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are looking at a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations of different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted, the effective temperature is lower. The ratio n1/n2 would be increasing if the denominator (n2) is decreasing. Or wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Or wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So when T is lower (because the star has spots), the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. 

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, higher temperatures should lead to higher populations in higher energy levels. So, n2 increases with T, making n1/n2 decrease. So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, T decreases to 5500 K, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So the ratio is n1/n2. According to the Boltzmann factor, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k*T) ) ). If E2 is higher than E1, then E1-E2 is negative. So the exponential becomes exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, ΔE is E2-E1. So, if E2 > E1, then E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases. Because ΔE is positive, as T increases, denominator kT increases, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the exponential term larger.

Therefore, for higher T, n1/n2 increases. Wait, but that's only if g1 and g2 are the same. But if the statistical weights are the same, then n1/n2 is inversely proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), so it's proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, maybe it's better to write the ratio as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E1-E2) is negative. So, for example, if E2 is higher, then (E1-E2) is negative, so the exponent is negative. So, higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the exponential term is larger. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( something negative ), but as T increases, that something becomes less negative. So for higher T, n1/n2 increases. Wait, no. For higher T, the denominator kT is larger, so (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes a smaller negative number. So the exponent is a smaller negative number, meaning exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So yes, exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So when T increases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative, making the exponential term larger. So n1/n2 would increase with T.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature decreases to 5500 K, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the above, when T goes down, n1/n2 should decrease. Because with lower T, (E1-E2)/(k T) is more negative. So the exponent is more negative, so exp(-x) is smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease. Which matches the problem statement. So, in this scenario, when the effective temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So that makes sense.

So, the question is to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So we’re looking for (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Using the Boltzmann equation:

(n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 is the same in both cases, because the energy levels are the same, just the temperature changes. So the ratio will be proportional to the exponential terms.

So the factor is:

Factor = [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

(E1 - E2)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2]

But since E2 > E1 (I think), because photons are emitted when electrons drop from higher to lower energy levels. The problem says the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. So assuming E2 is higher than E1.

So E1-E2 is negative. Let me note that:

E1 - E2 = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive.

So the exponent becomes:

(-ΔE/k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] 

= (-ΔE/k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ), which is the same as (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

But since E1-E2 is negative, let me write:

Factor = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

= exp( [ (E1-E2) (T2 - T1) ] / (k T1 T2) )

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it as:

The ratio (n1/n2) for T1 is (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) )

The ratio (n1/n2) for T2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) )

So the factor is [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Which can be written as exp( (E1-E2)(T2 - T1)/(k T1 T2) )

But since E1 < E2, (E1-E2) is negative, so let me write it as:

Factor = exp( (E2 - E1)(T1 - T2)/(k T1 T2) )

Because E1-E2 = -(E2-E1), and T2 < T1 (since when T decreases, spots are present). So T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500.

So, T1 > T2, so (T1 - T2) is positive.

Thus, the factor is exp( (E2 - E1) (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2) )

Now, we need to find the value of (E2 - E1). We know the transition corresponds to wavelength 1448 Å. Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of wavelength λ. The energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So, E_photon = (E2 - E1) = hc/λ.

So, E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute that.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 3.00e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 )

Calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's the energy of the photon. So E2 - E1 = 1.373e-18 J.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

We can compute the exponent:

(E2 - E1) (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2 )

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So T1 - T2 = 500 K.

T1 T2 = 6000 * 5500 = 33,000,000 K·m? Wait, no, units are K each, so 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000 (unit is K^2).

Wait, no, 6000 *5500 = 6e3 *5.5e3 = 33e6 = 3.3e7.

Wait, 6000 * 5500 = 33,000,000 (3.3e7).

So putting it all together:

Numerator: (1.373e-18 J) * (500 K) = 6.865e-16 J·K.

Denominator: (1.3806e-23 J/K) * (3.3e7 K^2) ) → 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = 4.556e-16 J·K.

Wait, let me compute denominator: 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = (1.3806 * 3.3) * 1e-23+7 → 4.556 * 1e-16 → 4.556e-16 J·K.

So the entire exponent is:

(6.865e-16) / (4.556e-16) ) → approximately 1.507.

So the exponent is about 1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.507.

We can approximate it:

1.507 is between 1.5 and 1.6.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.507 = e^(1.5 + 0.007) = e^1.5 * e^0.007.

e^0.007 ≈ 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So e^1.507 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.007) → 4.4817 + 0.03137 ≈ 4.513.

Wait, but that's approximately 4.5. Hmm, but wait, this would make the factor about 4.5. So the ratio when the star is spotless (T=6000) is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots (T=5500). Because the ratio n1/n2 is lower when the star has spots, so when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of about 4.5.

Wait, let me think again. The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)(T1-T2) / (k T1 T2) ) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculation to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute E_photon:

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

E_photon = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Let me compute that:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-25+7 = 1.373 * 1e-18 = 1.373e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, (E2-E1) = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, (E2-E1)(T1 - T2) = 1.373e-18 * 500 = 6.865e-16 J·K.

Denominator: k*T1*T2 = 1.3806e-23 * (6000 *5500) = 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = 4.55598e-16 J.

So the exponent is 6.865e-16 / 4.55598e-16 = approximately 1.507.

Yes, that's correct.

e^1.507 ≈ 4.51. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the energies of the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the effective temperature is lower (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)) compared to when the star is spotless (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)).

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) corresponds to the energy of the photon emitted during the transition, which is related to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\) by:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant and \(c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, we compute the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right),
\]

where \(k = 1.3806 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). First, calculate \(T_1 T_2 = 6000 \times 5500 = 3.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{K}^2\). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = \frac{500}{3.3 \times 10^7} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \frac{(1.373 \times 10^{-18})}{(1.3806 \times 10^{-23})} \times (1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.507.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. The correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to unpack it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are looking at a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They want to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations of different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star is spotted, the effective temperature is lower. The ratio n1/n2 would be increasing if the denominator (n2) is decreasing. Or wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, and when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. Or wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. So when T is lower (because the star has spots), the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. 

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, higher temperatures should lead to higher populations in higher energy levels. So, n2 increases with T, making n1/n2 decrease. So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, T decreases to 5500 K, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So the ratio is n1/n2. According to the Boltzmann factor, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k*T) ) ). If E2 is higher than E1, then E1-E2 is negative. So the exponential becomes exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, ΔE is E2-E1. So, if E2 > E1, then E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases. Because ΔE is positive, as T increases, denominator kT increases, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the exponential term larger.

Therefore, for higher T, n1/n2 increases. Wait, but that's only if g1 and g2 are the same. But if the statistical weights are the same, then n1/n2 is inversely proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), so it's proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, maybe it's better to write the ratio as (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E1-E2) is negative. So, for example, if E2 is higher, then (E1-E2) is negative, so the exponent is negative. So, higher T makes the exponent less negative, so the exponential term is larger. So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( something negative ), but as T increases, that something becomes less negative. So for higher T, n1/n2 increases. Wait, no. For higher T, the denominator kT is larger, so (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes a smaller negative number. So the exponent is a smaller negative number, meaning exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So yes, exp(-x) increases as x decreases. So when T increases, the exponent (E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative, making the exponential term larger. So n1/n2 would increase with T.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature decreases to 5500 K, and the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the above, when T goes down, n1/n2 should decrease. Because with lower T, (E1-E2)/(k T) is more negative. So the exponent is more negative, so exp(-x) is smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease. Which matches the problem statement. So, in this scenario, when the effective temperature is lower, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So that makes sense.

So, the question is to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So we’re looking for (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

Using the Boltzmann equation:

(n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 is the same in both cases, because the energy levels are the same, just the temperature changes. So the ratio will be proportional to the exponential terms.

So the factor is:

Factor = [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Wait, let's compute the exponent:

(E1 - E2)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2]

But since E2 > E1 (I think), because photons are emitted when electrons drop from higher to lower energy levels. The problem says the transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. So assuming E2 is higher than E1.

So E1-E2 is negative. Let me note that:

E1 - E2 = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive.

So the exponent becomes:

(-ΔE/k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] 

= (-ΔE/k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent as (E1-E2)/(k T1) - (E1-E2)/(k T2) ), which is the same as (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

But since E1-E2 is negative, let me write:

Factor = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

= exp( [ (E1-E2) (T2 - T1) ] / (k T1 T2) )

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it as:

The ratio (n1/n2) for T1 is (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) )

The ratio (n1/n2) for T2 is (g1/g2) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) )

So the factor is [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Which can be written as exp( (E1-E2)(T2 - T1)/(k T1 T2) )

But since E1 < E2, (E1-E2) is negative, so let me write it as:

Factor = exp( (E2 - E1)(T1 - T2)/(k T1 T2) )

Because E1-E2 = -(E2-E1), and T2 < T1 (since when T decreases, spots are present). So T1 is 6000, T2 is 5500.

So, T1 > T2, so (T1 - T2) is positive.

Thus, the factor is exp( (E2 - E1) (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2) )

Now, we need to find the value of (E2 - E1). We know the transition corresponds to wavelength 1448 Å. Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of wavelength λ. The energy of the photon is E_photon = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So, E_photon = (E2 - E1) = hc/λ.

So, E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute that.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 3.00e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So, E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 ) / (1.448e-7 )

Calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's the energy of the photon. So E2 - E1 = 1.373e-18 J.

But Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

We can compute the exponent:

(E2 - E1) (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2 )

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

So T1 - T2 = 500 K.

T1 T2 = 6000 * 5500 = 33,000,000 K·m? Wait, no, units are K each, so 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000 (unit is K^2).

Wait, no, 6000 *5500 = 6e3 *5.5e3 = 33e6 = 3.3e7.

Wait, 6000 * 5500 = 33,000,000 (3.3e7).

So putting it all together:

Numerator: (1.373e-18 J) * (500 K) = 6.865e-16 J·K.

Denominator: (1.3806e-23 J/K) * (3.3e7 K^2) ) → 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = 4.556e-16 J·K.

Wait, let me compute denominator: 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = (1.3806 * 3.3) * 1e-23+7 → 4.556 * 1e-16 → 4.556e-16 J·K.

So the entire exponent is:

(6.865e-16) / (4.556e-16) ) → approximately 1.507.

So the exponent is about 1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.507.

We can approximate it:

1.507 is between 1.5 and 1.6.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^1.507 = e^(1.5 + 0.007) = e^1.5 * e^0.007.

e^0.007 ≈ 1 + 0.007 + (0.007)^2/2 ≈ 1.00700245.

So e^1.507 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.007) → 4.4817 + 0.03137 ≈ 4.513.

Wait, but that's approximately 4.5. Hmm, but wait, this would make the factor about 4.5. So the ratio when the star is spotless (T=6000) is 4.5 times higher than when it has spots (T=5500). Because the ratio n1/n2 is lower when the star has spots, so when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher by a factor of about 4.5.

Wait, let me think again. The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)(T1-T2) / (k T1 T2) ) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the calculation to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute E_photon:

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m.

E_photon = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Let me compute that:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-25+7 = 1.373 * 1e-18 = 1.373e-18 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, (E2-E1) = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, (E2-E1)(T1 - T2) = 1.373e-18 * 500 = 6.865e-16 J·K.

Denominator: k*T1*T2 = 1.3806e-23 * (6000 *5500) = 1.3806e-23 * 3.3e7 = 4.55598e-16 J.

So the exponent is 6.865e-16 / 4.55598e-16 = approximately 1.507.

Yes, that's correct.

e^1.507 ≈ 4.51. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the energies of the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, indicating that the effective temperature is lower (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)) compared to when the star is spotless (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)).

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \(E_2 - E_1\) corresponds to the energy of the photon emitted during the transition, which is related to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\) by:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant and \(c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light. Substituting \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
E_2 - E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} = 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Next, we compute the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right),
\]

where \(k = 1.3806 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). First, calculate \(T_1 T_2 = 6000 \times 5500 = 3.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{K}^2\). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2} = \frac{500}{3.3 \times 10^7} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = \frac{(1.373 \times 10^{-18})}{(1.3806 \times 10^{-23})} \times (1.515 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.507.
\]

Thus, the factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. The correct answer is:
