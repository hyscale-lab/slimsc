Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, each with different powers of ten.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3), where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. Oh right, and A is the area of the event horizon. So knowing A is key here.

But how do I find A from the given angular size and distance? Oh, right, the event horizon's angular size relates to its actual size via the distance. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon and d is the distance. But wait, θ is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians because the formula R = d * θ (in radians) would make sense.

Let me convert θ from degrees to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees). Let me compute that: 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, 180 is about 2e2, so 1e-17 / 2e2 is 5e-20, but multiplied by π/180, which is about 0.01745, so 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah.

So R ≈ d * θ. But wait, distance needs to be in meters. Oh right, d is given in parsecs. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = d * θ (in radians) = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ Let's multiply those numbers. 3e26 * 1.7e-19 is 5.1e7 meters. Wait, more precisely: 3.086 *1.745 is about 5.37, so 5.37e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters.

But wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2GM/c², and for a black hole, the event horizon radius is R_s. So R = 2GM/c². But I'm not sure if I need that right now. Alternatively, knowing R gives me the area A as 4πR².

So A = 4π R². Let me compute that. R is 5.37e7 m, so R squared is (5.37e7)^2 = approx 2.88e15 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566. So 12.566 * 2.88e15 ≈ 3.63e16 m².

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation. R is about 5.37e7 m. R squared is (5.37e7)^2 = (5.37)^2 * 1e14 = about 28.8 *1e14 = 2.88e15 m². Then, 4π times that is about 35.9e15 m², which is 3.59e16 m². Yeah, that's correct.

Now, entropy S is (k A)/(4 ħ c^3). Let me get all the constants straight. k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (6.2832) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s. So c^3 is (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So putting it all together: S = k * A / (4 * ħ * c^3 )

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

A = 3.59e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

c^3 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

So S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3.59e16 m²) / (4 * 1.055e-34 J·s * 2.7e25 m³/s³ )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.59e16 = (1.38 *3.59) * 1e-7 ≈ 5.00 * 1e-7 = 5e-7 J·m²/(K·s) ??? Wait, I'm not sure about the units, but maybe just focus on the exponents.

Denominator: 4 *1.055e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.055 *2.7) * 1e-9 → 4 * 2.8485 ≈11.394 → 11.394e-9 (which is 1.1394e-8). So denominator is approximately 1.14e-8.

So S ≈ (5e-7) / (1.14e-8) = (5 / 1.14 ) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) → about 4.386 * 10 = 43.86. So S is about 4.4e1 J/K, which is about 44 J/K. Wait, that can't be right. Because 44 is way smaller than the options given, which are 1e59 and similar. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation of R. Let me double-check the initial steps.

Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians: 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So R = d * θ = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = Let me multiply the exponents: 1e26 *1e-19 = 1e7. 3.086 *1.745 ≈5.37. So R ≈5.37e7 meters. That part was correct.

So area A is 4π R² = 4π (5.37e7)^2. (5.37e7)^2 is 5.37^2 =28.83, so 28.83e14 = 2.883e15 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566. 12.566 * 2.883e15 ≈ 3.63e16 m². So A is about 3.63e16 m².

Wait, but wait a second, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole is R = 2GM/c². But since M is the mass, maybe I can compute the mass from R? Because once I have the mass, I can find the entropy via the formula S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), which might be another approach. Hmm, not sure if that's necessary, but perhaps it's a good way to check.

Wait, let me think again about the entropy formula. The correct formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G) * (1/(4π)) ? Or is it S = (k A c^3)/(4 ħ G) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ), where A is the area of the event horizon. Wait, but then I think the formula is S = (k_B A)/(4 ħ c^-3 ... ) No, wait, perhaps I should look it up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll try to get it right.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (k_B A c^3 )/(4 ħ G) ). Let me double-check: The area A is 4π R_s², where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2 G M / c². So A = 4π (2 G M / c²)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4.

Then, plugging into S: S = (k_B * (16 π G² M² / c^4 ) * c^3 )/(4 ħ )

= (k_B 16 π G² M² c^-1 )/(4 ħ )

Simplify: 16/4 =4, so 4 π k_B G² M² c^-1 / ħ 

Hmm, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let's just proceed with the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of S. Let me recompute S correctly.

So S = (k A )/(4 ħ c^3 )

Wait, plug in the values again:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

A = 3.63e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

So numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.63e16 = 1.38 *3.63 = approx 5.02. So 5.02e-7.

Denominator: 4 * 1.055e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.055 * 2.7) = 4 * 2.8485 ≈11.394. So 11.394e-34+25 = 11.394e-9? Wait no, exponents add when multiplied. So 1e-34 *1e25 =1e-9. So denominator is 11.394e-9 = 1.1394e-8.

So S = (5.02e-7) / (1.1394e-8 ) ≈ 43.97 J/K. That's about 44 J/K. But wait, that's way too small compared to the options given.

Something's wrong here. Oh wait, because I think I messed up the formula. Because the correct formula is S = (k c^3 A ) / (4 ħ G) ). So I think I missed the G factor in the denominator. Because in my previous calculation, I don't see G in the denominator, but I should have.

Wait, so the correct formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ). Let me recalculate with this.

So S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

c^3 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

A = 3.63e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So compute numerator: k * c^3 * A = 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 *3.63e16

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 = ~3.726 → 3.726e2 = 372.6. Then multiply by 3.63e16 → 372.6 *3.63 ≈ 1350. So 1350e16 → 1.35e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G = 4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 = 4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = Let's compute the exponents: 1e-34 *1e-11 = 1e-45. 4.22 *6.674 ≈28.16. So denominator is ~28.16e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S ≈ (1.35e19 ) / (2.816e-44 ) = (1.35 /2.816 ) * 1e63 → approx 0.479 *1e63 = 4.79e62 J/K.

So S ≈ 5e62 J/K, which is about 1e62. That's option A) 1e62 J/K.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because it's crucial.

Compute the numerator:

k = 1.38e-23, c^3 = 2.7e25, A =3.63e16.

Multiplying them: 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) * 1e( -23 +25 ) = 3.726 *1e2 = 372.6.

372.6 *3.63e16 = 372.6 *3.63 = Let's calculate that: 372 *3.63.

372 *3 = 1116, 372 *0.63= 234.36. So total 1350.36. So 1350.36e16 = 1.35036e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G.

ħ=1.055e-34, G=6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 =4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = (4.22 *6.674 )e( -34 -11 ) → 28.16e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S = 1.35e19 / 2.816e-44 = (1.35 /2.816) ) * 1e(19 +44) → approx 0.479 * 1e63 → 4.79e62 J/K.

So that's about 5e62, which is the same as 1e62 when considering the order of magnitude. So the answer should be option A) 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the area? Because R was 5.37e7 meters, so the area is 4π R². Let me check R squared:

5.37e7 meters squared is (5.37)^2 = 28.8369, so 28.8369e14 m² → 2.88369e15 m². Then multiplied by 4π (approx 12.566) gives 3.62e16 m². So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. The Schwarzschild radius is R = 2 G M / c². So M = (R c²) / (2 G). Let me compute M in case I can find another way.

R is 5.37e7 m.

So M = (5.37e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 *6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Compute numerator: 5.37e7 * (9e16) = 5.37e7 *9e16 = 4.833e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.674e-11 =1.3348e-10.

So M = (4.833e24) / (1.3348e-10 ) = (4.833 / 1.3348 )e34 → approx 3.616e34 kg.

Wait, that's a huge mass! But supermassive black holes can have masses up to millions or billions of solar masses. The sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So 3.6e34 kg is about 1.8e4 solar masses. Hmm, that seems a bit low for a supermassive black hole, which are more like millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in R.

Wait, let me recompute R.

d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

θ =1e-17 degrees =1e-17*(π/180) radians ≈1.745e-19 radians.

R = d * θ = 3.086e26 m *1.745e-19 rad = (3.086 *1.745 )e(26-19 ) = approx 5.37e7 m. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula for the angular size is not R/d. Because the angular size is actually θ ≈ R / (d), but for small angles, θ (in radians) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ opposite/adjacent. So yes, R = d * theta.

So M would be about 3.6e34 kg, which is 1.8e4 solar masses. But I thought supermassive black holes are up to 1e6 to 1e9 solar masses. Maybe I messed up the distance or the angle.

Wait, the question says d=1e10 parsecs. Let me double-check that. 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 parsecs, which is 10 billion parsecs. That's a very large distance, perhaps in the order of the universe's scale, but if the black hole's event horizon is 5e7 meters (about 50 km) in radius, then M is about 1.8e4 solar masses, which is plausible for a supermassive black hole. For example, Sagittarius A* is about 4 million solar masses. So perhaps 1.8e4 is within the expected range.

But perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the entropy.

Wait, S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ). Let me compute this again.

k =1.38e-23 J/K

c^3 = (3e8)^3 =2.7e24 m³/s³

A =3.63e16 m²

ħ =1.055e-34 J·s

G =6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So: k c^3 A = 1.38e-23 *2.7e24 *3.63e16.

Compute step by step:

1.38e-23 *2.7e24 = 1.38 *2.7 *1e1 =3.726 *10 =37.26.

37.26 *3.63e16 = 37.26 *3.63 = approx 135.16, so 135.16e16 =1.3516e18.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 =4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = (4.22 *6.674 )e( -34 -11 ) → 28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

So S = 1.3516e18 / 2.816e-44 = (1.3516 / 2.816 ) *1e(18 +44 ) = 0.4798 *1e62 =4.798e61 J/K.

Which is about 1e62 J/K.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the entropy is about 1e62 J/K, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where:
- \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( A \) is the area of the event horizon,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the radius of the event horizon
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \), and the distance to the black hole is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). First, convert \( \theta \) to radians:

\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The radius \( R \) of the event horizon is then:

\[
R = d \cdot \theta = (10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}) \times (3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec}) \times (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \, \text{radians}.
\]

\[
R \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area \( A \) of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

Substituting \( R = 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m} \):

\[
R^2 = (5.37 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 2.88 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi (2.88 \times 10^{15}) \approx 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy
Substitute \( A = 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \), \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3 \), \( \hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (3.63 \times 10^{16}) \approx 1.35 \times 10^{19}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.82 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
S = \frac{1.35 \times 10^{19}}{2.82 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.79 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \( 4.79 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to an order of magnitude of \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Final Answer:
The order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole is **\( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \)**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, each with different powers of ten.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (k * A) / (4 * ħ * c^3), where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. Oh right, and A is the area of the event horizon. So knowing A is key here.

But how do I find A from the given angular size and distance? Oh, right, the event horizon's angular size relates to its actual size via the distance. So the formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon and d is the distance. But wait, θ is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians because the formula R = d * θ (in radians) would make sense.

Let me convert θ from degrees to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees). Let me compute that: 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, 180 is about 2e2, so 1e-17 / 2e2 is 5e-20, but multiplied by π/180, which is about 0.01745, so 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Yeah.

So R ≈ d * θ. But wait, distance needs to be in meters. Oh right, d is given in parsecs. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = d * θ (in radians) = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ Let's multiply those numbers. 3e26 * 1.7e-19 is 5.1e7 meters. Wait, more precisely: 3.086 *1.745 is about 5.37, so 5.37e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters.

But wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2GM/c², and for a black hole, the event horizon radius is R_s. So R = 2GM/c². But I'm not sure if I need that right now. Alternatively, knowing R gives me the area A as 4πR².

So A = 4π R². Let me compute that. R is 5.37e7 m, so R squared is (5.37e7)^2 = approx 2.88e15 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566. So 12.566 * 2.88e15 ≈ 3.63e16 m².

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation. R is about 5.37e7 m. R squared is (5.37e7)^2 = (5.37)^2 * 1e14 = about 28.8 *1e14 = 2.88e15 m². Then, 4π times that is about 35.9e15 m², which is 3.59e16 m². Yeah, that's correct.

Now, entropy S is (k A)/(4 ħ c^3). Let me get all the constants straight. k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (6.2832) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s. So c^3 is (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So putting it all together: S = k * A / (4 * ħ * c^3 )

Plugging in the numbers:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

A = 3.59e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

c^3 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

So S = (1.38e-23 J/K) * (3.59e16 m²) / (4 * 1.055e-34 J·s * 2.7e25 m³/s³ )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.59e16 = (1.38 *3.59) * 1e-7 ≈ 5.00 * 1e-7 = 5e-7 J·m²/(K·s) ??? Wait, I'm not sure about the units, but maybe just focus on the exponents.

Denominator: 4 *1.055e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.055 *2.7) * 1e-9 → 4 * 2.8485 ≈11.394 → 11.394e-9 (which is 1.1394e-8). So denominator is approximately 1.14e-8.

So S ≈ (5e-7) / (1.14e-8) = (5 / 1.14 ) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) → about 4.386 * 10 = 43.86. So S is about 4.4e1 J/K, which is about 44 J/K. Wait, that can't be right. Because 44 is way smaller than the options given, which are 1e59 and similar. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation of R. Let me double-check the initial steps.

Wait, the distance is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians: 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So R = d * θ = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ 3.086e26 * 1.745e-19 = Let me multiply the exponents: 1e26 *1e-19 = 1e7. 3.086 *1.745 ≈5.37. So R ≈5.37e7 meters. That part was correct.

So area A is 4π R² = 4π (5.37e7)^2. (5.37e7)^2 is 5.37^2 =28.83, so 28.83e14 = 2.883e15 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566. 12.566 * 2.883e15 ≈ 3.63e16 m². So A is about 3.63e16 m².

Wait, but wait a second, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole is R = 2GM/c². But since M is the mass, maybe I can compute the mass from R? Because once I have the mass, I can find the entropy via the formula S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), which might be another approach. Hmm, not sure if that's necessary, but perhaps it's a good way to check.

Wait, let me think again about the entropy formula. The correct formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G) * (1/(4π)) ? Or is it S = (k A c^3)/(4 ħ G) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ), where A is the area of the event horizon. Wait, but then I think the formula is S = (k_B A)/(4 ħ c^-3 ... ) No, wait, perhaps I should look it up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll try to get it right.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S = (k_B A c^3 )/(4 ħ G) ). Let me double-check: The area A is 4π R_s², where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2 G M / c². So A = 4π (2 G M / c²)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4.

Then, plugging into S: S = (k_B * (16 π G² M² / c^4 ) * c^3 )/(4 ħ )

= (k_B 16 π G² M² c^-1 )/(4 ħ )

Simplify: 16/4 =4, so 4 π k_B G² M² c^-1 / ħ 

Hmm, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let's just proceed with the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of S. Let me recompute S correctly.

So S = (k A )/(4 ħ c^3 )

Wait, plug in the values again:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

A = 3.63e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

So numerator: 1.38e-23 * 3.63e16 = 1.38 *3.63 = approx 5.02. So 5.02e-7.

Denominator: 4 * 1.055e-34 * 2.7e25 = 4 * (1.055 * 2.7) = 4 * 2.8485 ≈11.394. So 11.394e-34+25 = 11.394e-9? Wait no, exponents add when multiplied. So 1e-34 *1e25 =1e-9. So denominator is 11.394e-9 = 1.1394e-8.

So S = (5.02e-7) / (1.1394e-8 ) ≈ 43.97 J/K. That's about 44 J/K. But wait, that's way too small compared to the options given.

Something's wrong here. Oh wait, because I think I messed up the formula. Because the correct formula is S = (k c^3 A ) / (4 ħ G) ). So I think I missed the G factor in the denominator. Because in my previous calculation, I don't see G in the denominator, but I should have.

Wait, so the correct formula is S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ). Let me recalculate with this.

So S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G )

Now, plugging in the numbers:

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

c^3 = 2.7e25 m³/s³

A = 3.63e16 m²

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s

G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².

So compute numerator: k * c^3 * A = 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 *3.63e16

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = 1.38 *2.7 = ~3.726 → 3.726e2 = 372.6. Then multiply by 3.63e16 → 372.6 *3.63 ≈ 1350. So 1350e16 → 1.35e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G = 4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 = 4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = Let's compute the exponents: 1e-34 *1e-11 = 1e-45. 4.22 *6.674 ≈28.16. So denominator is ~28.16e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S ≈ (1.35e19 ) / (2.816e-44 ) = (1.35 /2.816 ) * 1e63 → approx 0.479 *1e63 = 4.79e62 J/K.

So S ≈ 5e62 J/K, which is about 1e62. That's option A) 1e62 J/K.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because it's crucial.

Compute the numerator:

k = 1.38e-23, c^3 = 2.7e25, A =3.63e16.

Multiplying them: 1.38e-23 * 2.7e25 = (1.38 *2.7) * 1e( -23 +25 ) = 3.726 *1e2 = 372.6.

372.6 *3.63e16 = 372.6 *3.63 = Let's calculate that: 372 *3.63.

372 *3 = 1116, 372 *0.63= 234.36. So total 1350.36. So 1350.36e16 = 1.35036e19.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G.

ħ=1.055e-34, G=6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 =4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = (4.22 *6.674 )e( -34 -11 ) → 28.16e-45 = 2.816e-44.

So S = 1.35e19 / 2.816e-44 = (1.35 /2.816) ) * 1e(19 +44) → approx 0.479 * 1e63 → 4.79e62 J/K.

So that's about 5e62, which is the same as 1e62 when considering the order of magnitude. So the answer should be option A) 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I make a mistake in the area? Because R was 5.37e7 meters, so the area is 4π R². Let me check R squared:

5.37e7 meters squared is (5.37)^2 = 28.8369, so 28.8369e14 m² → 2.88369e15 m². Then multiplied by 4π (approx 12.566) gives 3.62e16 m². So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. The Schwarzschild radius is R = 2 G M / c². So M = (R c²) / (2 G). Let me compute M in case I can find another way.

R is 5.37e7 m.

So M = (5.37e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 *6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Compute numerator: 5.37e7 * (9e16) = 5.37e7 *9e16 = 4.833e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.674e-11 =1.3348e-10.

So M = (4.833e24) / (1.3348e-10 ) = (4.833 / 1.3348 )e34 → approx 3.616e34 kg.

Wait, that's a huge mass! But supermassive black holes can have masses up to millions or billions of solar masses. The sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So 3.6e34 kg is about 1.8e4 solar masses. Hmm, that seems a bit low for a supermassive black hole, which are more like millions to billions of solar masses. So perhaps I made a mistake in R.

Wait, let me recompute R.

d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

θ =1e-17 degrees =1e-17*(π/180) radians ≈1.745e-19 radians.

R = d * θ = 3.086e26 m *1.745e-19 rad = (3.086 *1.745 )e(26-19 ) = approx 5.37e7 m. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula for the angular size is not R/d. Because the angular size is actually θ ≈ R / (d), but for small angles, θ (in radians) ≈ tan(theta) ≈ opposite/adjacent. So yes, R = d * theta.

So M would be about 3.6e34 kg, which is 1.8e4 solar masses. But I thought supermassive black holes are up to 1e6 to 1e9 solar masses. Maybe I messed up the distance or the angle.

Wait, the question says d=1e10 parsecs. Let me double-check that. 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 parsecs, which is 10 billion parsecs. That's a very large distance, perhaps in the order of the universe's scale, but if the black hole's event horizon is 5e7 meters (about 50 km) in radius, then M is about 1.8e4 solar masses, which is plausible for a supermassive black hole. For example, Sagittarius A* is about 4 million solar masses. So perhaps 1.8e4 is within the expected range.

But perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the entropy.

Wait, S = (k c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ). Let me compute this again.

k =1.38e-23 J/K

c^3 = (3e8)^3 =2.7e24 m³/s³

A =3.63e16 m²

ħ =1.055e-34 J·s

G =6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So: k c^3 A = 1.38e-23 *2.7e24 *3.63e16.

Compute step by step:

1.38e-23 *2.7e24 = 1.38 *2.7 *1e1 =3.726 *10 =37.26.

37.26 *3.63e16 = 37.26 *3.63 = approx 135.16, so 135.16e16 =1.3516e18.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G =4 *1.055e-34 *6.674e-11.

4 *1.055e-34 =4.22e-34.

4.22e-34 *6.674e-11 = (4.22 *6.674 )e( -34 -11 ) → 28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

So S = 1.3516e18 / 2.816e-44 = (1.3516 / 2.816 ) *1e(18 +44 ) = 0.4798 *1e62 =4.798e61 J/K.

Which is about 1e62 J/K.

Hmm, so the calculation seems correct. So the entropy is about 1e62 J/K, which is option A.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where:
- \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( A \) is the area of the event horizon,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the radius of the event horizon
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \), and the distance to the black hole is \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). First, convert \( \theta \) to radians:

\[
\theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The radius \( R \) of the event horizon is then:

\[
R = d \cdot \theta = (10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}) \times (3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec}) \times (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \, \text{radians}.
\]

\[
R \approx 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area \( A \) of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

Substituting \( R = 5.37 \times 10^7 \, \text{m} \):

\[
R^2 = (5.37 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 2.88 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi (2.88 \times 10^{15}) \approx 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy
Substitute \( A = 3.63 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2 \), \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), \( c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{25} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3 \), \( \hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
k_B c^3 A = (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) \cdot (3.63 \times 10^{16}) \approx 1.35 \times 10^{19}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.055 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \approx 2.82 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
S = \frac{1.35 \times 10^{19}}{2.82 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 4.79 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the order of magnitude
The entropy is approximately \( 4.79 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \), which corresponds to an order of magnitude of \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

### Final Answer:
The order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole is **\( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \)**.
