Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me summarize the steps:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are provided.
2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.
3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide addition, giving product 3.
4. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

I need to figure out the structure after each reaction and then determine the NMR coupling for product 3.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, which is an elimination reaction. This typically forms an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the starting material is a bicyclic compound with two bromine atoms at adjacent positions.

Heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of a double bond. The IR spectrum of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, not an alkene. Wait, that's confusing. Alkenes have C=C around 1650 cm⁻¹, but here it's higher. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base is causing elimination but forming a ketone instead. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridge structure. If the bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a bridge with a double bond. But if the structure is such that the elimination leads to a conjugated diene or a more strained structure, perhaps the product is a ketone? Or maybe I'm mixing up the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Let me think. For a vicinal dihalide, treating with base would give an alkene. But if the base is in excess, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet? Or is it a triplet? The description says 4.79(2H), but the splitting isn't specified. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a multiplet, and 1.94 (2H), probably a triplet or something else.

The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, another reaction possibility: when two vicinal bromides are treated with a strong base, perhaps a diepoxide forms? No, that's with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines.

Wait, another angle: maybe the dihalide is undergoing a nucleophilic attack. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a bicyclic structure where elimination forms a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbene? Probably not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the first product's NMR. 4.79 ppm is probably an -OCH₂- group, considering that the chemical shift is around 4.7-4.8, which is typical for an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm⁻¹. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via elimination of HBr twice. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some other elimination, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a rearrangement. Wait, maybe the base deprotonates a bridgehead hydrogen, leading to a ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the initial product is a diketone. But how does that form from elimination of two equivalents of HBr?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But KOH is a base, so substitution would require a good leaving group. But with two bromines, perhaps in a vicinal fashion, substitution might lead to something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diol. But that would form from each Br being replaced by OH, but that would require a nucleophilic substitution. However, KOH is a strong base, and for substitution, we usually need a good leaving group. But in such a case, would we get a diol? But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are around 3300 cm⁻¹. The IR given has 1720, so not a diol.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction again. Heating with KOH, but perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, maybe the Ad is adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to two alkenes, but that would form a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but the product would have two double bonds? Or perhaps the elimination leads to a single double bond.

Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, leading to two adjacent bridgehead carbons each losing HBr, forming a double bond. So, the product would be a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But the IR suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit that. Hmm. Unless the structure after elimination has a bridge that's strained, leading to some ring contraction or expansion, maybe forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a norbornene derivative. Wait, no, but adamantane is a different structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic rings, which adamantane doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but an acid-base reaction. KOH is a strong base, maybe deprotonating the adamantane structure. But where are acidic hydrogens? Usually, bridgehead hydrogens are not very acidic. Unless the structure is such that deprotonation leads to a more stable carbanion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is treated with KOH in a way that substitutes both Br atoms with hydroxyl groups, but as I thought earlier, that would give a diol, which doesn't align with the IR data.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a geminal diol. But that would require two hydroxyls on the same carbon, which would require both Brs to be on the same carbon, which they aren't.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be an -OCH₂O- group, like an ether, but then why the carbonyl in IR? Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent groups.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let me think, if each Br is replaced by an O⁻, but then the product would be a diol, which again doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a ketone via some elimination. Let me think: if two HBr molecules are eliminated, perhaps leading to a ketone.

Wait, but for that, the structure must have adjacent Brs that, upon elimination of two HBr, form a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move to the second step and see if that gives any clues. The product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound, maybe a ketone, but product 2 would be an alkylation product.

Alternatively, product 1 might be a carbonyl compound, like a ketone. Then, with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR would show a different peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but again, IR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a cycloketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylated product.

But I'm not getting much from that, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, then treated with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive work-up, as opposed to oxidative with something like H2O2). Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have those carbonyl groups.

But wait, the NMR for product 3 is what's being asked. The question is about the coupling of the most deshielded proton, which is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group (since deshielding is common near electronegative groups or carbonyls).

In the first step, the product after KOH is a ketone (based on IR). So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a ketone. How?

1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent Br atoms on a bridge. When KOH is added and heated, perhaps each Br is eliminated with the abstraction of a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe each Br is in a position such that eliminating HBr forms a bridgehead double bond, and perhaps further reaction converts that into a ketone.

Alternatively, could it be a case of dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond, and then some isomerism or further reaction forms a carbonyl? I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, which upon heating with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of elimination.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the IR and NMR data of product 1.

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ - that's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester.

NMR:

4.79 (2H) - maybe an -OCH2- group. But if it's a ketone, perhaps it's an adjacent group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) - that's a lot of protons, perhaps in a ring structure, maybe from the adamantane part.

1.94 (2H) - maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like a bridge where a carbonyl group has been formed. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form a ketone.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons. If each Br undergoes elimination, each losing HBr, perhaps leading to the formation of adjacent carbonyl groups. But wait, two adjacent carbonyls would form a diketone, which is possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a single ketone. Wait, but each Br is on a different carbon. So, elimination would require each Br to lose HBr from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. But then how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination has a bridge that can undergo a retro-aldol type cleavage or some other rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH causes the dihalide to form a ketone via a different mechanism, but I can't remember.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the diol may undergo some kind of dehydration to form a ketone. But that would require two OH groups in proximity, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the diol loses water to form a ketone via an E1 or E2 mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, given that I'm stuck on the first step, maybe I should move forward and see if the other steps can give me clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So product 1 must have an aromatic ring or something that can undergo such a reaction. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes acylation. Or maybe product 1 is an aromatic compound.

Wait, but the initial compound is adamantane, which is a bicyclic structure, not aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an acylated product, but I'm not certain.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone) via KOH and heat.

2. Product 1 → product 2 (maybe with a double bond) via Al isopropoxide.

3. Product 2 → product 3 (with carbonyl groups from ozonolysis) via ozonolysis.

But I'm still not clear on product 1.

Wait, perhaps the first step is forming a diol, which then undergoes some reaction to form a ketone. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But I don't see an allyl vinyl ether in the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Cope elimination, but that's for 1,5-dienes.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structure of product 1. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 for 2H, which is possibly an OCH2O group, like in an acetal or an ether.

Wait, if product 1 is an acetal, that would make sense. An acetal would have a carbonyl converted into a CH2 group. But wait, no, acetals are typically derived from ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, if product 1 has a structure like (CH2O)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 1 as a bridged bicyclic compound with a ketone group.

Another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is the formation of a lactone. But that would require an ester linkage, which would fit the IR. But I don't see how the starting material would form a lactone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Maybe I should proceed despite the uncertainty. Let's say that product 1 is a ketone, so product 2, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps forms an enol ether or undergoes some alkylation.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts, which requires an aromatic ring. If product 1 is a ketone and somehow becomes aromatic after some reaction, perhaps through deprotonation and ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bridgehead ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement or forms an enol, which then can undergo alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which would make sense because the next step is ozonolysis.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a diene (with a double bond), product 3 is the ozonolysis product with two carbonyl groups.

But how does product 1 become product 2? Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination or reaction involving the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an epoxide. Wait, an epoxide has an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a glycol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a bridge with a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination of two HBr molecules forms a bridge between the two carbons, resulting in a ketone.

So, the structure would have a carbonyl group where the two Brs were. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the two protons next to the carbonyl. Wait, but in that case, the 4.79 ppm would be the two protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think: the 4.79 singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is a bridge with a carbonyl and a CH2 group connected to it.

So, the NMR would have:

- 4.79 (2H, singlet) : CH2 adjacent to carbonyl.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H): perhaps the other bridgehead hydrogens and other ring hydrogens.
- 1.94 (2H): maybe another CH2 group.

So, product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Then, product 2 is made by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide acts as a Lewis acid catalyst for some kind of enolate formation or alkylation.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a conjugated double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

So, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups on each end.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, let's think about product 3. It's the ozonolysis product of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 will have protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded protons are typically near electronegative atoms or in regions of high electron withdrawal, like next to carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on its neighboring protons.

Assuming that in product 2, the double bond is between two similar groups, ozonolysis would break it into two identical carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two symmetrical carbonyl groups.

Each of these carbonyls would be next to a CH2 group, perhaps. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and could couple with each other and any other neighboring protons.

Wait, but if the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would create two ketones. The resulting product 3 would have two ketone groups. The protons adjacent to each ketone (on the CH2 groups) would be deshielded.

Each of these CH2 protons would be next to two others. Let me imagine a structure: say, (CH2)2CO. But wait, ozonolysis of a diene would lead to two carbonyl groups. If the diene was CH2=CHCH2CH2..., I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene like CH2=CHCH2CH2..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But wait, 1,3-pentadiene has two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-pentadiene would have conjugated double bonds. Ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a monoene, like CH2=CH2. No, that's ethylene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of product 2 as having a single double bond. Ozonolysis of a single double bond would give two carbonyl groups on each end.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

In the NMR, the CH2 protons next to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Each of these protons would be adjacent to two others (the other CH2 protons), and possibly coupled with any neighboring groups.

Assuming the CH2 protons are each adjacent to two others, their coupling pattern would be a triplet. Because each proton is next to two equivalent protons, each coupling with two neighbors would lead to a triplet.

Wait, but that's only if the neighboring protons are equivalent. So, for example, if each CH2 has two adjacent protons, each of the two protons would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

But in reality, each proton in a CH2 group would couple with the two adjacent protons in the same CH2 group. Wait, but in a CH2 group, each H is next to two others, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H in the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, for a CH2 group, each H is next to two others (the two Hs on the same CH2). So, each H would couple with two others, each coupling constant being the same. So, the splitting would be a triplet. So, the triplet would be due to coupling with two equivalent Hs.

But wait, sometimes in such cases, the coupling can lead to more complex splitting. For example, if each H is also coupled with another set of Hs, like on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. So, each CH2 is next to another CH2. Then, the protons on the CH2 groups would be split by the adjacent CH2 protons.

But perhaps the structure is more like CH2COCH2CO. Wait, that would come from ozonolysis of a conjugated diene like CH2=CHCH2CH2. No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: the coupling pattern options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded H is likely adjacent to the carbonyl, so in a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

If each H is only coupled to two others (the two adjacent Hs in the same CH2), then the splitting would be a triplet. So option A) triplet.

But wait, maybe the CH2 is part of a longer chain. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 group's Hs would be coupled with the next CH2's Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the second CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are two neighboring CH2 groups, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet. But then that would be option D) pentet.

Wait, but the most deshielded Hs are likely only next to two Hs, so triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to each H being coupled with two from the same group and two from another, giving a quartet or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a geminal coupling, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to another set of two Hs, leading to coupling with two on each side. So, each H would be coupled with two on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is next to two Hs on one side and another set of one H on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets. Hmm. Not sure.

Another angle: in the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups are at the ends. So, the structure would be something like R-CO-R', where R and R' are the fragments from the diene. If the diene was symmetric, R and R' would be the same.

If the diene was a simple alkene like CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formyl groups. But in reality, the product would be O=CH2, which is formaldehyde, but that's a gas and wouldn't have an NMR. So, perhaps the diene is longer.

Suppose the diene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. Then, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes, but perhaps in this case, the diene is part of a larger structure.

Wait, the initial structure is adamantane, which is a bicyclic compound. So, when product 2 is ozonolysed, the product 3 would break a bridge, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms two ketone groups.

Each ketone would be attached to a CH2 group. The Hs on the CH2 would be near the carbonyl, so deshielded.

So, each H in the CH2 would be split by the two adjacent Hs in the same CH2 group. So, a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H in the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs in the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also by the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to option B.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if each H in the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs from one side and one H from another, that might give a different splitting pattern. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling. For each H in the CH2, it's coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also coupled with two Hs from an adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is only within the same CH2 group, making a triplet.

I think I need to make a decision. Given the options, and considering that the most deshielded H is adjacent to two Hs in the same group and possibly others, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is next to two Hs (same CH2), it gives a triplet. But if the H is also next to another set of two Hs from an adjacent group, the coupling would split each peak into a triplet again, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if the H is next to two Hs and one more H elsewhere, it could be a quartet or another pattern. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the most deshielded H might be a methylene group (CH2) next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is between two carbonyls, it would have two adjacent Hs and be next to another CH2 group. So, each H in the central CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs in the same group and the two Hs in the adjacent group.

In that case, each H would have 2 + 2 = 4 neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (option D). But that's not one of the options given—wait, yes, option D is pentet. Hmm.

Wait, but how would the CH2 be between two carbonyls? Let me imagine a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 would have two adjacent Hs. The Hs in the middle CH2 would be next to two on the left and two on the right. So each H is coupled with four Hs, leading to a quintet. So in the NMR, these Hs would split into a pentet.

But wait, the product of ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups on each end, not necessarily in the middle. So, maybe the structure is O=C-R and R'-CO, where R and R' are the remaining parts.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone, where the CH2 groups are each adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So each H is coupled with two on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent, leading to a quartet.

But the options don't include a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, leading to each H being split by four Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), which would be a quintet.

But I'm not certain, but considering the options, the most likely answer is triplet of triplets (option B), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: In a typical CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is only coupled with the two other Hs in the same CH2 group. So the splitting is a triplet. Thus, the answer would be A) triplet.

But in some cases, where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would also couple with the two Hs in the adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. So if product 3's structure has two adjacent CH2 groups next to carbonyls, each H would be coupled with two in the same CH2 and two in the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, I'm now leaning towards option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and the question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) suggest a bicyclic structure.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is identified as a ketone, likely formed via elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions.  
   - Since product 1 is a ketone, product 2 likely contains a double bond formed via some rearrangement or alkylation reaction, setting it up for ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 contains a conjugated diene or a single double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls strongly deshield nearby protons.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each proton in this CH₂ group is coupled with the two other protons in the same CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.  
   - If the CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group, the protons would additionally couple with the two protons in the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet of triplets.  
   - Given the options, the coupling pattern is most consistent with a triplet of triplets, as the CH₂ group is likely part of a structure where each proton is coupled with two protons from the same group and two from an adjacent group.

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.  

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me summarize the steps:

1. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are provided.
2. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.
3. Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide addition, giving product 3.
4. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

I need to figure out the structure after each reaction and then determine the NMR coupling for product 3.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, which is an elimination reaction. This typically forms an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the starting material is a bicyclic compound with two bromine atoms at adjacent positions.

Heating with KOH would likely lead to the formation of a double bond. The IR spectrum of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, not an alkene. Wait, that's confusing. Alkenes have C=C around 1650 cm⁻¹, but here it's higher. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base is causing elimination but forming a ketone instead. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridge structure. If the bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination would form a bridge with a double bond. But if the structure is such that the elimination leads to a conjugated diene or a more strained structure, perhaps the product is a ketone? Or maybe I'm mixing up the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. Let me think. For a vicinal dihalide, treating with base would give an alkene. But if the base is in excess, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H) as a singlet? Or is it a triplet? The description says 4.79(2H), but the splitting isn't specified. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H), which is a multiplet, and 1.94 (2H), probably a triplet or something else.

The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, another reaction possibility: when two vicinal bromides are treated with a strong base, perhaps a diepoxide forms? No, that's with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines.

Wait, another angle: maybe the dihalide is undergoing a nucleophilic attack. But KOH is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's a bicyclic structure where elimination forms a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, if the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbene? Probably not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the first product's NMR. 4.79 ppm is probably an -OCH₂- group, considering that the chemical shift is around 4.7-4.8, which is typical for an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1720 cm⁻¹. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't support that. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a ketone via elimination of HBr twice. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some other elimination, but I'm not familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a rearrangement. Wait, maybe the base deprotonates a bridgehead hydrogen, leading to a ring expansion or contraction.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the initial product is a diketone. But how does that form from elimination of two equivalents of HBr?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But KOH is a base, so substitution would require a good leaving group. But with two bromines, perhaps in a vicinal fashion, substitution might lead to something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial product is a diol. But that would form from each Br being replaced by OH, but that would require a nucleophilic substitution. However, KOH is a strong base, and for substitution, we usually need a good leaving group. But in such a case, would we get a diol? But then the IR would show O-H stretches, which are around 3300 cm⁻¹. The IR given has 1720, so not a diol.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction again. Heating with KOH, but perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, maybe the Ad is adamantane, which is a diamondoid structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to two alkenes, but that would form a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe each elimination forms a bridgehead double bond. Wait, but the product would have two double bonds? Or perhaps the elimination leads to a single double bond.

Wait, perhaps each Br is removed, leading to two adjacent bridgehead carbons each losing HBr, forming a double bond. So, the product would be a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But the IR suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit that. Hmm. Unless the structure after elimination has a bridge that's strained, leading to some ring contraction or expansion, maybe forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a norbornene derivative. Wait, no, but adamantane is a different structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's for aromatic rings, which adamantane doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but an acid-base reaction. KOH is a strong base, maybe deprotonating the adamantane structure. But where are acidic hydrogens? Usually, bridgehead hydrogens are not very acidic. Unless the structure is such that deprotonation leads to a more stable carbanion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is treated with KOH in a way that substitutes both Br atoms with hydroxyl groups, but as I thought earlier, that would give a diol, which doesn't align with the IR data.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a geminal diol. But that would require two hydroxyls on the same carbon, which would require both Brs to be on the same carbon, which they aren't.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be an -OCH₂O- group, like an ether, but then why the carbonyl in IR? Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent groups.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let me think, if each Br is replaced by an O⁻, but then the product would be a diol, which again doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a ketone via some elimination. Let me think: if two HBr molecules are eliminated, perhaps leading to a ketone.

Wait, but for that, the structure must have adjacent Brs that, upon elimination of two HBr, form a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move to the second step and see if that gives any clues. The product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide.

Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So if product 1 is an aromatic compound, maybe a ketone, but product 2 would be an alkylation product.

Alternatively, product 1 might be a carbonyl compound, like a ketone. Then, with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR would show a different peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but again, IR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a cycloketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, maybe it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylated product.

But I'm not getting much from that, maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, then treated with dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive work-up, as opposed to oxidative with something like H2O2). Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have those carbonyl groups.

But wait, the NMR for product 3 is what's being asked. The question is about the coupling of the most deshielded proton, which is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group (since deshielding is common near electronegative groups or carbonyls).

In the first step, the product after KOH is a ketone (based on IR). So product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of a ketone. How?

1,3-dibromoadamantane has two adjacent Br atoms on a bridge. When KOH is added and heated, perhaps each Br is eliminated with the abstraction of a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe each Br is in a position such that eliminating HBr forms a bridgehead double bond, and perhaps further reaction converts that into a ketone.

Alternatively, could it be a case of dehydrohalogenation forming a double bond, and then some isomerism or further reaction forms a carbonyl? I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a diol, which upon heating with Al isopropoxide undergoes some kind of elimination.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the IR and NMR data of product 1.

IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ - that's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester.

NMR:

4.79 (2H) - maybe an -OCH2- group. But if it's a ketone, perhaps it's an adjacent group.

2.41-2.23 (10H) - that's a lot of protons, perhaps in a ring structure, maybe from the adamantane part.

1.94 (2H) - maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the structure is something like a bridge where a carbonyl group has been formed. So, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form a ketone.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgehead carbons. If each Br undergoes elimination, each losing HBr, perhaps leading to the formation of adjacent carbonyl groups. But wait, two adjacent carbonyls would form a diketone, which is possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a single ketone. Wait, but each Br is on a different carbon. So, elimination would require each Br to lose HBr from adjacent carbons, leading to a double bond. But then how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the structure after elimination has a bridge that can undergo a retro-aldol type cleavage or some other rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH causes the dihalide to form a ketone via a different mechanism, but I can't remember.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an OH group, but then the diol may undergo some kind of dehydration to form a ketone. But that would require two OH groups in proximity, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the diol loses water to form a ketone via an E1 or E2 mechanism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, given that I'm stuck on the first step, maybe I should move forward and see if the other steps can give me clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So product 1 must have an aromatic ring or something that can undergo such a reaction. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes acylation. Or maybe product 1 is an aromatic compound.

Wait, but the initial compound is adamantane, which is a bicyclic structure, not aromatic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an acylated product, but I'm not certain.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (ketone) via KOH and heat.

2. Product 1 → product 2 (maybe with a double bond) via Al isopropoxide.

3. Product 2 → product 3 (with carbonyl groups from ozonolysis) via ozonolysis.

But I'm still not clear on product 1.

Wait, perhaps the first step is forming a diol, which then undergoes some reaction to form a ketone. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But I don't see an allyl vinyl ether in the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Cope elimination, but that's for 1,5-dienes.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structure of product 1. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 for 2H, which is possibly an OCH2O group, like in an acetal or an ether.

Wait, if product 1 is an acetal, that would make sense. An acetal would have a carbonyl converted into a CH2 group. But wait, no, acetals are typically derived from ketones or aldehydes.

Wait, if product 1 has a structure like (CH2O)2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diketone. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of product 1 as a bridged bicyclic compound with a ketone group.

Another thought: Maybe the initial reaction is the formation of a lactone. But that would require an ester linkage, which would fit the IR. But I don't see how the starting material would form a lactone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

Maybe I should proceed despite the uncertainty. Let's say that product 1 is a ketone, so product 2, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps forms an enol ether or undergoes some alkylation.

Wait, Al isopropoxide is used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts, which requires an aromatic ring. If product 1 is a ketone and somehow becomes aromatic after some reaction, perhaps through deprotonation and ring formation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bridgehead ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement or forms an enol, which then can undergo alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which would make sense because the next step is ozonolysis.

Wait, if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a diene (with a double bond), product 3 is the ozonolysis product with two carbonyl groups.

But how does product 1 become product 2? Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via some elimination or reaction involving the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an epoxide. Wait, an epoxide has an IR peak around 1250 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a glycol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms a bridge with a carbonyl group. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination of two HBr molecules forms a bridge between the two carbons, resulting in a ketone.

So, the structure would have a carbonyl group where the two Brs were. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the two protons next to the carbonyl. Wait, but in that case, the 4.79 ppm would be the two protons adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, let me think: the 4.79 singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, maybe the structure is a bridge with a carbonyl and a CH2 group connected to it.

So, the NMR would have:

- 4.79 (2H, singlet) : CH2 adjacent to carbonyl.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H): perhaps the other bridgehead hydrogens and other ring hydrogens.
- 1.94 (2H): maybe another CH2 group.

So, product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Then, product 2 is made by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide acts as a Lewis acid catalyst for some kind of enolate formation or alkylation.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether, which would have a conjugated double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

So, if product 2 has a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups on each end.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, let's think about product 3. It's the ozonolysis product of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 will have protons adjacent to these carbonyls.

The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded protons are typically near electronegative atoms or in regions of high electron withdrawal, like next to carbonyl groups.

In product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern would depend on its neighboring protons.

Assuming that in product 2, the double bond is between two similar groups, ozonolysis would break it into two identical carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have two symmetrical carbonyl groups.

Each of these carbonyls would be next to a CH2 group, perhaps. The protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and could couple with each other and any other neighboring protons.

Wait, but if the double bond in product 2 is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would create two ketones. The resulting product 3 would have two ketone groups. The protons adjacent to each ketone (on the CH2 groups) would be deshielded.

Each of these CH2 protons would be next to two others. Let me imagine a structure: say, (CH2)2CO. But wait, ozonolysis of a diene would lead to two carbonyl groups. If the diene was CH2=CHCH2CH2..., I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene like CH2=CHCH2CH2..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break each double bond into carbonyls. But wait, 1,3-pentadiene has two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-pentadiene would have conjugated double bonds. Ozonolysis of 1,3-pentadiene would give two aldehydes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a monoene, like CH2=CH2. No, that's ethylene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of product 2 as having a single double bond. Ozonolysis of a single double bond would give two carbonyl groups on each end.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

In the NMR, the CH2 protons next to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Each of these protons would be adjacent to two others (the other CH2 protons), and possibly coupled with any neighboring groups.

Assuming the CH2 protons are each adjacent to two others, their coupling pattern would be a triplet. Because each proton is next to two equivalent protons, each coupling with two neighbors would lead to a triplet.

Wait, but that's only if the neighboring protons are equivalent. So, for example, if each CH2 has two adjacent protons, each of the two protons would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

But in reality, each proton in a CH2 group would couple with the two adjacent protons in the same CH2 group. Wait, but in a CH2 group, each H is next to two others, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, if it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H in the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, for a CH2 group, each H is next to two others (the two Hs on the same CH2). So, each H would couple with two others, each coupling constant being the same. So, the splitting would be a triplet. So, the triplet would be due to coupling with two equivalent Hs.

But wait, sometimes in such cases, the coupling can lead to more complex splitting. For example, if each H is also coupled with another set of Hs, like on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO. So, each CH2 is next to another CH2. Then, the protons on the CH2 groups would be split by the adjacent CH2 protons.

But perhaps the structure is more like CH2COCH2CO. Wait, that would come from ozonolysis of a conjugated diene like CH2=CHCH2CH2. No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane derivative, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Another approach: the coupling pattern options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

The most deshielded H is likely adjacent to the carbonyl, so in a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

If each H is only coupled to two others (the two adjacent Hs in the same CH2), then the splitting would be a triplet. So option A) triplet.

But wait, maybe the CH2 is part of a longer chain. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 group's Hs would be coupled with the next CH2's Hs. So, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs in the second CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are two neighboring CH2 groups, each H would be coupled with four Hs (two from each adjacent CH2), leading to a quintet. But then that would be option D) pentet.

Wait, but the most deshielded Hs are likely only next to two Hs, so triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to each H being coupled with two from the same group and two from another, giving a quartet or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a geminal coupling, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to another set of two Hs, leading to coupling with two on each side. So, each H would be coupled with two on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is next to two Hs on one side and another set of one H on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets. Hmm. Not sure.

Another angle: in the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl groups are at the ends. So, the structure would be something like R-CO-R', where R and R' are the fragments from the diene. If the diene was symmetric, R and R' would be the same.

If the diene was a simple alkene like CH2=CH2, ozonolysis would give two formyl groups. But in reality, the product would be O=CH2, which is formaldehyde, but that's a gas and wouldn't have an NMR. So, perhaps the diene is longer.

Suppose the diene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. Then, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes, but perhaps in this case, the diene is part of a larger structure.

Wait, the initial structure is adamantane, which is a bicyclic compound. So, when product 2 is ozonolysed, the product 3 would break a bridge, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a double bond that, upon ozonolysis, forms two ketone groups.

Each ketone would be attached to a CH2 group. The Hs on the CH2 would be near the carbonyl, so deshielded.

So, each H in the CH2 would be split by the two adjacent Hs in the same CH2 group. So, a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group. So, each H in the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs in the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also by the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to option B.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if each H in the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs from one side and one H from another, that might give a different splitting pattern. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling. For each H in the CH2, it's coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and also coupled with two Hs from an adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the coupling is only within the same CH2 group, making a triplet.

I think I need to make a decision. Given the options, and considering that the most deshielded H is adjacent to two Hs in the same group and possibly others, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is next to two Hs (same CH2), it gives a triplet. But if the H is also next to another set of two Hs from an adjacent group, the coupling would split each peak into a triplet again, leading to a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if the H is next to two Hs and one more H elsewhere, it could be a quartet or another pattern. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the most deshielded H might be a methylene group (CH2) next to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is between two carbonyls, it would have two adjacent Hs and be next to another CH2 group. So, each H in the central CH2 would be coupled with the two Hs in the same group and the two Hs in the adjacent group.

In that case, each H would have 2 + 2 = 4 neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (option D). But that's not one of the options given—wait, yes, option D is pentet. Hmm.

Wait, but how would the CH2 be between two carbonyls? Let me imagine a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Each CH2 would have two adjacent Hs. The Hs in the middle CH2 would be next to two on the left and two on the right. So each H is coupled with four Hs, leading to a quintet. So in the NMR, these Hs would split into a pentet.

But wait, the product of ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups on each end, not necessarily in the middle. So, maybe the structure is O=C-R and R'-CO, where R and R' are the remaining parts.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis product is a diketone, where the CH2 groups are each adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So each H is coupled with two on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent, leading to a quartet.

But the options don't include a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, leading to each H being split by four Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), which would be a quintet.

But I'm not certain, but considering the options, the most likely answer is triplet of triplets (option B), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: In a typical CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each H is only coupled with the two other Hs in the same CH2 group. So the splitting is a triplet. Thus, the answer would be A) triplet.

But in some cases, where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would also couple with the two Hs in the adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. So if product 3's structure has two adjacent CH2 groups next to carbonyls, each H would be coupled with two in the same CH2 and two in the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, I'm now leaning towards option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to product 3, and the question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely corresponding to a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. The other signals (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) suggest a bicyclic structure.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is identified as a ketone, likely formed via elimination of two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

2. **Reaction 2: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions.  
   - Since product 1 is a ketone, product 2 likely contains a double bond formed via some rearrangement or alkylation reaction, setting it up for ozonolysis.

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 contains a conjugated diene or a single double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls strongly deshield nearby protons.

4. **Analysis of the coupling pattern**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each proton in this CH₂ group is coupled with the two other protons in the same CH₂ group, leading to a triplet.  
   - If the CH₂ group is also adjacent to another CH₂ group, the protons would additionally couple with the two protons in the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet of triplets.  
   - Given the options, the coupling pattern is most consistent with a triplet of triplets, as the CH₂ group is likely part of a structure where each proton is coupled with two protons from the same group and two from an adjacent group.

**Conclusion:** The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.  

Answer: B
