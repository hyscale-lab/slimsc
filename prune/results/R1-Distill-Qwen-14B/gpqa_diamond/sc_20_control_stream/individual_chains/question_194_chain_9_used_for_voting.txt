Okay, so I've got this problem about three spins and their partition function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to calculate all possible energy states and their corresponding Boltzmann factors.

Wait, but each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, and S3 being +1 or -1.

I think the first approach is to list all possible combinations and calculate the energy E for each. But that might take a while. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way by considering the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think: each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Because if S_i and S_j are the same, their product is +1, else -1. So each term contributes ±1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from what? The maximum would be when all products are +1, so 3. The minimum would be when all are -1, so -3. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, can all three terms be -1 at the same time? Let's see. Suppose all three spins are +1: then each product is +1, so sum is 3. If all are -1, then each product is +1 again, because (-1)(-1) is +1. So the sum is still 3. So that's two cases where the sum is 3.

What about when two spins are +1 and one is -1? Let's see. Let's say S1 = S2 = +1, S3 = -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, but wait: Wait, S1S2 is +1, S1S3 is (-1)(-1)= +1? Wait no, S3 is -1, so S1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1. Similarly, S2S3 is (-1). So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So the sum is -1.

Alternatively, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. All products are +1. Sum is 3.

Now what about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Another case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is (-1)(-1)= +1, S2S3 is (+1). So sum is -1 +1 +1= 1.

Wait, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3?

Wait, let me think again. Each term is the product of two spins. So for each pair, the product is either +1 or -1. But the sum could vary. Let me try to find all possible sums.

Alternatively, maybe group the cases based on the number of +1 and -1 spins.

Case 1: All three spins are +1. So S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. There's only 1 such state.

Case 2: All three spins are -1. Same as above, all products are +1. Sum is 3. So another 1 state, same sum.

Case 3: Two spins are +1, one is -1. How many such states are there? There are 3 choose 1 =3 possibilities. Let's take each and calculate the sum.

Let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3= -1. So sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Similarly, other two cases where two are +1 and one is -1: same sum of -1.

Case 4: Two spins are -1, one is +1. Let's see S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = (-1)(+1)= -1, S1S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1, S2S3= (+1). So sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

Wait, no. S2 is -1, S3 is -1, so S2S3 is (+1). So sum is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.

Wait, but wait another case: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (+1), S1S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1, S2S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So all three cases where two are -1 and one is +1 give the sum of -1.

Wait, but wait: let me think more carefully. S1 and S2 are -1, S3 is +1.

S1S2 = (+1), S1S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1, S2S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

So all states in Cases 3 and 4 (two +1, one -1 and two -1, one +1) have sum -1.

Case 5: All three spins are a mix, but wait, no, each spin is either +1 or -1. Oh, wait, what about when one spin is +1 and the others are -1? For example, S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. That's the same as Case 4.

Wait, no, wait. All possible states have been considered: 1 (all +1), 1 (all -1), 3 (two +1, one -1), and 3 (two -1, one +1). That's 1+1+3+3=8, which matches 2^3=8 possible states.

Wait, no. Wait, two +1 and one -1: the number of such states is 3 (choose which spin is -1). Similarly, two -1 and one +1: 3 states. Plus the two all same cases. So total 8.

So the possible sums are:

- Sum = 3: occurs in 2 states (all +1 and all -1).

- Sum = -1: occurs in 6 states (3+3).

Wait, but wait. Let me check other possibilities. Are there any states where the sum is 1 or -3?

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

So S1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (+1), S2S3 = (-1). Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Alternatively, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

Wait, okay, so what about a state where two are +1 and one -1, but the sum is different? Let me think. No, seems like all such states have sum -1.

Wait, no. Another approach: perhaps the sum can be 1. Let's see. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then sum is 1 (S1S2) + (-1) (S1S3) + (-1) (S2S3) → sum is -1.

Wait, what if all the products are +1 except one? Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider each possible configuration.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should list all 8 states and their corresponding sums.

State 1: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → Sum of products: 1+1+1=3.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → Sum: (-1) + (-1) + (-1) → Wait, no: S1S2 is (-1), S1S3 is (+1), S2S3 is (-1). So sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) → -1.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1.

S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

State 3: sum -1.

State4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2: (-1), S1S3: (-1), S2S3: (+1). Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2: (-1), S1S3: (-1), S2S3: (+1). Sum: (-1)+(-1)+(+1)= -1.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2: (-1)(+1)= -1. S1S3: (+1). S2S3: (-1)(-1) = +1.

Sum: (-1) + (+1) + (+1) → 1.

Wait, that's a different sum! So this state has sum 1.

Wait a minute, so state6 has sum 1. So that's a new possibility.

Wait, let me check that again.

S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.

Wait, that's sum -1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate state6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)(-1) = +1.

S2S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1.

So sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

So that state also has sum -1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier thinking there's a state with sum 1.

Wait, let me check another state. State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (+1), S1S3 = (-1), S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.

Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

State8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. All products are +1. Sum=3.

Wait, so looking at all 8 states, the sum can be 3 or -1. Because in state6, I thought I saw a sum of 1, but no, that was a miscalculation. So all states except the all +1 and all -1 have sum -1.

Wait, but wait another state: let me think. What about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Sum is -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a state where the sum is 1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps for a system of three spins, the sum can take values 3, 1, -1, -3. Let me see.

If all three are the same (all +1 or all -1), sum is 3.

If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is (1 +1 -1) = 1? Or am I getting this wrong.

Wait no, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, let's take two +1 and one -1. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Wait, but what if two are -1 and one is +1? Let's take S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Then S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.

Hmm. So perhaps the sum can only be 3 or -1.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a state with sum 1, but that was a miscalculation.

So to clarify, the sum can be:

- 3: when all spins are same (two states).

- -1: when two spins are same and one different (six states).

Wait, wait a second—no. Because when two are same and one is different, in all cases, the sum is -1. So 6 states have sum -1.

So the possible energies are:

E = - J * sum.

So when sum is 3, E = -J *3.

When sum is -1, E = -J * (-1) = J.

Wait, so each state where sum is 3 contributes an energy of -3J.

Each state where sum is -1 contributes an energy of J.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp( -β E ).

So for the two states where E = -3J, their contribution is exp( -β*(-3J) ) = exp(3Jβ).

Each of the six states with E=J contributes exp(-β J) = exp(-Jβ).

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ).

Wait, but according to our calculation, it's 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ), which is option B.

Wait, option B is Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ), which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I mix up the exponents.

Energy for sum=3: E = -3J.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -β E ) = exp( 3 J β ).

Energy for sum=-1: E= J.

Boltzmann factor: exp( -β J ) = e^(-Jβ).

So yes, Z = 2 e^(3 J β ) + 6 e^(-J β ), which is option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, opposite exponents.

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ) → Yes.

Option C: 2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ) → Exponents are double.

Option D:6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ) → Also double, seems off.

So the correct partition function is option B.

To solve the problem, we consider a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function \( Z \) is defined as the sum over all possible states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \).

### Step 1: Determine the possible values of the energy
The term \( S_iS_j \) can only take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), depending on whether the spins \( S_i \) and \( S_j \) are aligned or anti-aligned. The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore range from \( -3 \) to \( +3 \). However, not all values are possible:

1. **Case 1: All spins are the same**  
   - If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \), then \( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = +1 \), so the sum is \( +3 \).  
   - If \( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \), then \( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = +1 \), so the sum is \( +3 \).  
   - Number of states with sum \( +3 \): 2.

2. **Case 2: Two spins are the same, one is different**  
   - For example, \( S_1 = S_2 = +1 \) and \( S_3 = -1 \):  
     \( S_1S_2 = +1 \), \( S_1S_3 = -1 \), \( S_2S_3 = -1 \), so the sum is \( -1 \).  
   - Similarly, all other configurations with two spins the same and one different will also yield a sum of \( -1 \).  
   - Number of states with sum \( -1 \): 6.

3. **Case 3: All spins are different**  
   This configuration is not possible for three spins, as each spin can only take two values, \( +1 \) or \( -1 \).

Thus, the possible sums are \( +3 \) (2 states) and \( -1 \) (6 states).

### Step 2: Calculate the energy for each case
The energy \( E \) is related to the sum as follows:
- For sum \( +3 \): \( E = -J(+3) = -3J \).  
- For sum \( -1 \): \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

### Step 3: Compute the partition function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \). For the two states with \( E = -3J \), the contribution is:
\[
2 \exp(-\beta(-3J)) = 2 \exp(3J\beta).
\]
For the six states with \( E = J \), the contribution is:
\[
6 \exp(-\beta J) = 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]
Thus, the partition function is:
\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
From the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2 \exp(-3J\beta) + 6 \exp(J\beta) \) (incorrect, exponents are reversed).  
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta) \) (correct, matches the derived expression).  
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2 \exp(2J\beta) + 6 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, exponents are doubled).  
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6 \exp(2J\beta) + 2 \exp(-2J\beta) \) (incorrect, exponents are doubled and coefficients are swapped).

The correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
