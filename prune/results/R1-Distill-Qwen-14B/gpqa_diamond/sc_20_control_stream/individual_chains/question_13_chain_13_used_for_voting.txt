Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, something like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative because it's a common terpene. The (R) configuration suggests it's the enantiomer with a specific stereochemistry.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh right, that's hydrogenation. So, what's hydrogenated in limonene? Limonene has a double bond, probably in the ring structure. Hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bond, saturating it. So limonene, which is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond, becomes a cycloalkane after hydrogenation. Wait, but limonene is actually a bicyclic structure—so maybe it's a bridged bicyclic compound. So hydrogenation would add H2 across a double bond, making it a single bond. So the product after hydrogenation, product 1, would be the hydrogenated limonene. But wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So it's partial hydrogenation? Or is it complete? Hmm. Oh, no, Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and if one equivalent is used, probably it's fully hydrogenated because each double bond would take one equivalent. Wait, limonene has one double bond, so adding one equivalent of H2 would saturate it once. So product 1 is the fully hydrogenated limonene, which would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane or similar, but with the substituents as in limonene.

Wait, limonene is (R)-(+)-Limonene. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, I think. So when you hydrogenate it, you get bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, in the product, would any substituents change? Like, the hydrogenation doesn't change substituents, just the double bond. So product 1 is the saturated limonene, without the double bond. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure, but I'll proceed.

Next, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. But wait, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which doesn't have a double bond anymore. So that's confusing. Because if product 1 is fully hydrogenated, there's no double bond to epoxidize. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me rethink.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. Wait, limonene has a double bond in a ring structure. If only 1 equivalent of H2 is consumed, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation, but I don't think that's correct because hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 is usually catalytic and goes to completion. So perhaps product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene with the double bond saturated.

But if that's the case, treating it with mCPBA wouldn't do anything because no double bond is present. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. Oh no, the first step says stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen, which is definitely hydrogenation. So I'm confused. Unless, product 1 is a dihydro form, but then mCPBA wouldn't react.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't limonene but a substituted limonene? No, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene.

Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Limonene has a specific structure—maybe it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond. So hydrogenation would add H2 to the double bond, making it a single bond. So product 1 is the saturated limonane.

But then, how does the next step with mCPBA work? Because mCPBA is an oxidizing agent for epoxidation, but without a double bond, no epoxidation occurs. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, maybe the first step is not hydrogenation. No, the reagent is Pd/C and H2, so that must be hydrogenation. Oh, wait! Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of another functional group. But limonene doesn't have any other functional groups to hydrogenate, like ketones or something. So I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product after hydrogenation isn't the fully hydrogenated compound. Maybe it's a diastereomer or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of an exocyclic double bond, which would change the structure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is partial, but that doesn't make much sense because Pd/C is a catalyst that usually adds H2 completely.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a substituted double bond. Wait, maybe limonene has a double bond that's part of a ring, and the hydrogenation would saturate it, leading to a bicyclo structure without the double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure more clearly. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So that's product 1.

Then, product 1 is treated with mCPBA. Since product 1 is saturated (no double bonds), mCPBA wouldn't react. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing a step or the starting material is different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial hydrogenation is not of the double bond but another part, but limonene doesn't have any other double bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a substituted position. Maybe the hydrogenation leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is hydrogenolysis, but I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the reaction is a hydrogenation of a ketone, but limonene doesn't have a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 isn't the hydrogenated limonene but a different product. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of the substituents. Hmm, but limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with isoprenoid substituents. Oh wait, limonene has a substituent, perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a double bond in a substituent, but I don't think limonene has that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the subsequent steps. Because product 1 is treated with mCPBA to form product 2, which then is treated with sodium methoxide to form product 3, and then with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP to form product 4.

Wait, after mCPBA, which is an oxidizing agent, perhaps it's adding an epoxide. So product 1 must have a double bond for that. So perhaps product 1 isn't the hydrogenated limonene, but has another double bond.

Wait, that would mean that the hydrogenation didn't affect the main double bond. That can't be right because limonene's structure is such that Pd/C would hydrogenate the double bond. Maybe the initial structure isn't the one I'm thinking of.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of limonene. Let me think again.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but another possible structure is a substituted cyclohexene. Alternatively, maybe limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which upon hydrogenation becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Wait, but then mCPBA wouldn't do anything. So perhaps the hydrogenation is of a different double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is an allylic hydrogenation. Wait, but I don't think Pd/C does that. It's usually for hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrogenation is not of limonene itself but of some other part of the molecule. Maybe the limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like an exocyclic double bond, which upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond.

Wait, but limonene's structure is a bicyclic structure with a single double bond in the ring. So hydrogenation would saturate that, leaving no double bonds. So then the next step with mCPBA wouldn't do anything. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Step 1: (R)-limonene + Pd/C, H2 → product 1 (after 1 eq H2 consumed). So it's hydrogenated, but since limonene has one double bond, 1 eq of H2 adds across it, making a single bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonane.

But then, product 1 has no double bonds, so mCPBA wouldn't react. Therefore, product 2 would be same as product 1. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, but perhaps the product 1 is something else. Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the main double bond but of some other group. For example, maybe limonene has a double bond that isn't part of the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. But the presence of Pd/C and H2 suggests hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to ring-opening or another structural change. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the initial limonene isn't a bicyclic structure. Maybe it's a monocyclic cyclic monoterpene with a substituent. Let me think. If limonene is a substituted cyclohexene, hydrogenation would give cyclohexane.

Wait, but (R)-limonene is a bicyclic compound, I think. So maybe the hydrogenation leads to a structure that still has a double bond elsewhere? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not complete, so product 1 still has a double bond. But under Pd/C and H2, the reaction should go to completion. So this is confusing.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hydrogenation isn't of the main double bond but of another part. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation of an exocyclic double bond. For example, if limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like an isoprenoid chain.

Wait, limonene has a structure that includes a substituent like a methyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but the main structure is the ring with the double bond. So perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the first step. Maybe the first step is a different reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the limonene itself but of a solvent, like methanol. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think about the entire process.

After the hydrogenation (step 1), product 1 is treated with mCPBA (step 2) to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (step 3), and then product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (step 4) to form product 4.

Wait, if product 1 doesn't have a double bond, step 2 (mCPBA) does nothing. Then product 2 is same as product 1. Then step 3 is treatment with sodium methoxide. What does that do? Sodium methoxide is a strong base and can induce elimination, maybe. Alternatively, if product 2 is same as product 1, which is a bicyclo structure, maybe it's a tertiary alcohol or something. Wait, no, product 1 comes from hydrogenation, which usually doesn't add any functional groups.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the first step. Maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. But that can't be because the reagents are Pd/C and H2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial limonene is a ketone or another functional group that can undergo hydrogenation. But wait, limonene is a terpene; I think it's a hydrocarbon with a double bond.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should move on to the other steps and see if that gives me any clues.

After product 2 is formed, it's treated with sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide is a strong base. It can cause elimination reactions or deprotonation. Maybe product 2 has an epoxide, which when treated with a base would open. So if product 2 is an epoxide, then step 3 would be ring-opening.

Wait, but if product 1 didn't have a double bond, then product 2 can't have an epoxide. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the options and see if I can figure out what the transformations are leading to.

Looking at the options, they're all cyclic structures with substituents like isopropyl, methoxy, methyl, and propionate groups.

Option A: (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option B: (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option C: (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option D: 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate.

Hmm. Well, the options all involve cyclohexyl groups with various substituents and propionate esters.

Product 4 is formed by treating product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. DCC is a coupling agent, and DMAP is a catalyst. So that's a coupling reaction, probably forming an ester. So product 3 must have a hydroxyl group, and propanoic acid would form an ester with it, using DCC as the coupling agent.

So product 3 is an alcohol, and product 4 is the ester.

Before that, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with sodium methoxide. So product 2 must have a functional group that reacts with a base to form an alcohol. Alternatively, product 2 is an epoxide, and the base opens it to form an alcohol. So product 3 would be a diol, perhaps, but then how would that form an ester?

Wait, maybe product 2 is an epoxide, and the base opens it to form a diol. Then, treatment with propanoic acid, etc., would form an ester at one of the diol's hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but let's think again.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Limonene → product 1 (hydrogenation)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (mCPBA)
3. Product 2 → product 3 (NaOme)
4. Product 3 → product 4 (propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP)

So step 4 is forming an ester from an alcohol.

Assuming product 3 is an alcohol, then product 4 is the ester.

Now, step 3: product 2 → product 3 with sodium methoxide.

If product 2 is an epoxide, then sodium methoxide (a strong base) would open the epoxide. Epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically leads to the formation of an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives an alcohol.

So, product 3 would be a diol, but wait, if the epoxide is opened in a specific way, perhaps it's a vicinal diol, but that would require two hydroxyl groups.

But then, step 4 is forming an ester from an alcohol. If product 3 has two -OH groups, perhaps one is deprotonated and the other forms the ester. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base in step 3 is causing an elimination reaction, but that depends on the structure.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 could be an epoxide, which upon treatment with base forms a diol. Then, in step 4, one of the diol's OH groups is converted to an ester. Alternatively, the diol could lose water to form an alkene, but that's more under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the base in step 3 is causing an elimination, forming a new double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's go back to product 1. If product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a bicyclo structure without any double bonds, then product 2 would be the same as product 1, and product 3 would be the same as product 1. But then, product 3 is treated to form an ester, which doesn't make sense because product 3 would be the bicyclo structure, which doesn't have any OH groups.

So perhaps my earlier assumption about the first step is incorrect. Maybe the hydrogenation doesn't saturate the double bond.

Wait, but the reaction is under H2 and Pd/C. That should hydrogenate the double bond.

Wait, unless the limonene has an exocyclic double bond that's not in the ring. For example, maybe limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the hydrogenation would saturate that, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. Then, product 1 would still have a double bond in the ring, which would react with mCPBA to form an epoxide.

That could make sense. Let me think about this.

If limonene has a substituent with a double bond, such as a vinyl group, then hydrogenation would hydrogenate that substituent, leaving the main ring's double bond untouched. So product 1 would have the main double bond still present.

Then, mCPBA would epoxidize that double bond in product 1, forming an epoxide in product 2. Then, product 2 would be an epoxide, which when treated with a base like sodium methoxide would open the epoxide. The base would deprotonate and cause the epoxide to ring-open, forming an alcohol.

Wait, but if the epoxide is in a ring structure, the ring-opening would lead to a diol, or perhaps a diastereomer. Then, treatment with sodium methoxide would form an alcohol, which would then be esterified in the next step.

But wait, let me think about the structure. Let's say limonene has a substituent with a double bond, such as a methyl group attached to a CH2-CH2 group, which upon hydrogenation becomes CH2-CH3. Then, the main ring's double bond is still present.

So, step 1: hydrogenation of the substituent's double bond, leaving the main ring's double bond.

Step 2: mCPBA epoxidizes the main ring's double bond.

Step 3: sodium methoxide opens the epoxide, perhaps via a ring-opening reaction, which would form two OH groups or maybe eliminate to form a diol.

Wait, but sodium methoxide is a strong base; in an epoxide ring-opening, the base would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which attacks the less substituted oxygen, leading to the opening of the epoxide.

Wait, but in a cyclic epoxide, the ring-opening would form a diol. So product 3 would be a diol.

Then, step 4: treating product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP would form an ester by coupling the acid with an alcohol.

But how would that work if there are two OH groups? Perhaps one of them is a primary alcohol, which is more reactive, and the other is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, which is less reactive. So the primary OH would react with the acid to form the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is set up such that one OH is in a position that's more reactive towards the esterification.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of the products.

Looking at the options, option D is interesting because it has a cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group. That suggests that the product still has a double bond, perhaps from a ring-opening or another reaction.

Wait, but in the step 4, the ester is formed. So perhaps, in product 3, there's an alcohol that's in a position that, when esterified, leads to one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial hydrogenation doesn't affect the main ring. Let me think: If the main ring's double bond is untouched, then mCPBA would epoxidize it, leading to product 2 as an epoxide. Then, treatment with sodium methoxide would open the epoxide, perhaps leading to an alcohol.

Wait, but earlier I thought that product 1 would have the main double bond saturated, but perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the substituent's double bond is hydrogenated, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. That would explain why mCPBA can epoxidize it in step 2.

So, let me re-examine this.

If the starting material is (R)-limonene, which has a double bond in the ring and another double bond in a substituent (like a substituent with a CH2=CH2 group), then hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 would hydrogenate the substituent's double bond. So product 1 would have the substituent as a single bond, leaving the main ring's double bond intact.

Then, product 1 is treated with mCPBA, which epoxidizes the main ring's double bond, forming an epoxide (product 2).

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide is a strong base and would perform a ring-opening of the epoxide. The ring-opening would involve the base abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, leading to the formation of an alkoxide which attacks the less hindered oxygen of the epoxide. This would result in the formation of an alcohol.

Wait, but in a cyclic epoxide, the ring-opening would form a diol, but depending on the structure, perhaps it's a vicinal diol. Then, product 3 would be a diol.

But then, product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. DCC is a coupling agent used in forming esters or amides. So, the diol would have two OH groups. The reaction would likely esterify one of the OH groups with the propanoic acid, using DCC as the coupling agent.

But wait, DCC is used with carboxylic acids and alcohols to form esters. So if product 3 has an alcohol, and it's treated with a carboxylic acid (propanoic acid) and DCC, it would form an ester.

But in product 3, if there are two OH groups, perhaps the more accessible one (like a primary or secondary alcohol) would react, leaving the other as a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

But this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at option D: 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate.

This structure has a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at position 3), a methoxy group, and a propionate ester. So, perhaps limonene's structure or some intermediate still has a double bond, leading to the presence of a cyclohexene in product 4.

Wait, but product 4 is formed after all the steps, including hydrogenation, epoxidation, ring-opening, and esterification. So the presence of a double bond in product 4 would suggest that one of the steps re-introduced a double bond.

Hmm. Let me think about each step again.

1. (R)-limonene → Pd/C, H2 → product 1. If limonene has a substituent with a double bond, product 1 would hydrogenate that, leaving the main ring's double bond intact.

2. product 1 → mCPBA → product 2. mCPBA would epoxidize the main ring's double bond.

3. product 2 → NaOme → product 3. Sodium methoxide opens the epoxide, forming an alcohol.

If the epoxide is in a ring, the ring-opening could form a diol, leading to a cyclohexane diol. But perhaps in this case, the ring-opening leads to a new structure with an alcohol group.

4. product 3 → propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP → product 4. This forms an ester from the alcohol in product 3.

Now, considering the options, option D has a cyclohexene ring. That suggests that the double bond is present in product 4. So, perhaps in product 3, there's a structure that, upon esterification, doesn't affect the double bond.

Wait, but product 3 comes from the ring-opening of an epoxide, which usually doesn't form double bonds. Unless the ring-opening is accompanied by elimination.

Wait, sodium methoxide is a base. If the ring-opening of the epoxide under basic conditions leads to the formation of a double bond via elimination, that could explain the presence of a cyclohexene in product 4.

So, step 3: product 2 (epoxide) → treated with NaOme. The base could open the epoxide and abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination. So, product 3 would have a double bond where the epoxide was.

Then, product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP to form an ester. So, product 4 would have a double bond and an ester group.

Looking at option D, it has a cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group. So, the double bond is at position 3, meaning that during the ring-opening, an elimination occurred to form a double bond.

So, putting it all together:

- Step 1: Hydrogenation of a substituent double bond, leaving the main ring's double bond.

- Step 2: Epoxidation of the main ring's double bond.

- Step 3: Base-induced ring-opening of the epoxide, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond.

- Step 4: Esterification of an alcohol to form a propionate ester.

Therefore, product 4 would have a cyclohexene ring and an ester group.

Looking at the options, option D is the only one with a cyclohexene ring. The other options are cyclohexane derivatives.

So, option D is a possible candidate.

But let me check the other options. Option A has a cyclohexyl group with substituents, but no double bond. So, that would require that the final product doesn't have a double bond, which would only happen if the epoxide wasn't opened by elimination.

In our scenario, the base opens the epoxide and induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, product 4 would have a double bond.

Therefore, the correct option must be D.

Wait, but I should also consider the stereochemistry. Limonene is (R) configuration. How does that affect the final product?

In the initial step, the hydrogenation would lead to a specific configuration. Then, the epoxidation would form the epoxide with certain stereochemistry. The ring-opening with a base would form the diol or the double bond with specific stereochemistry.

In option D, the cyclohexene has an (S) configuration at position 4 (as per the substituents). So, the configuration would depend on the steps.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's a bit challenging, but based on the presence of the double bond, option D seems correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the final answer:

1. **Step 1: Hydrogenation**  
   (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond in its ring structure. The hydrogenation reaction adds hydrogen across the double bond, saturating it. However, limonene also has a substituent with a double bond (e.g., a vinyl group). The hydrogenation selectively saturates this substituent, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. Thus, product 1 retains the main ring's double bond.

2. **Step 2: Epoxidation**  
   Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which reacts with the double bond in the main ring to form an epoxide. This results in product 2, which is an epoxide.

3. **Step 3: Base-Induced Ring-Opening**  
   Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, a strong base. The base opens the epoxide ring. Under these conditions, elimination can occur, leading to the formation of a double bond in the main ring. This results in product 3, which is a compound with a double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

4. **Step 4: Esterification**  
   Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). DCC is a coupling agent used to form esters. One of the hydroxyl groups in product 3 reacts with the propanoic acid to form a propionate ester, resulting in product 4.

5. **Analysis of the Options**  
   - **Option A, B, and C**: These options describe cyclohexane derivatives with no double bond. This contradicts the reaction sequence, as the final step involves a compound with a double bond (formed during the base-induced elimination in step 3).  
   - **Option D**: This option describes a cyclohexene derivative with a double bond (cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group) and a propionate ester. This matches the expected structure of product 4, as the double bond is retained after the elimination step, and the ester is formed in the final step.

Based on the reaction sequence and the structural analysis, the correct answer is **Option D**, as it is the only option consistent with the presence of a double bond in the final product.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, something like a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative because it's a common terpene. The (R) configuration suggests it's the enantiomer with a specific stereochemistry.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh right, that's hydrogenation. So, what's hydrogenated in limonene? Limonene has a double bond, probably in the ring structure. Hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the double bond, saturating it. So limonene, which is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond, becomes a cycloalkane after hydrogenation. Wait, but limonene is actually a bicyclic structure—so maybe it's a bridged bicyclic compound. So hydrogenation would add H2 across a double bond, making it a single bond. So the product after hydrogenation, product 1, would be the hydrogenated limonene. But wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So it's partial hydrogenation? Or is it complete? Hmm. Oh, no, Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, and if one equivalent is used, probably it's fully hydrogenated because each double bond would take one equivalent. Wait, limonene has one double bond, so adding one equivalent of H2 would saturate it once. So product 1 is the fully hydrogenated limonene, which would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane or similar, but with the substituents as in limonene.

Wait, limonene is (R)-(+)-Limonene. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, I think. So when you hydrogenate it, you get bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, in the product, would any substituents change? Like, the hydrogenation doesn't change substituents, just the double bond. So product 1 is the saturated limonene, without the double bond. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure, but I'll proceed.

Next, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. But wait, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which doesn't have a double bond anymore. So that's confusing. Because if product 1 is fully hydrogenated, there's no double bond to epoxidize. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me rethink.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. Wait, limonene has a double bond in a ring structure. If only 1 equivalent of H2 is consumed, perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation, but I don't think that's correct because hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 is usually catalytic and goes to completion. So perhaps product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene with the double bond saturated.

But if that's the case, treating it with mCPBA wouldn't do anything because no double bond is present. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. Oh no, the first step says stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen, which is definitely hydrogenation. So I'm confused. Unless, product 1 is a dihydro form, but then mCPBA wouldn't react.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't limonene but a substituted limonene? No, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene.

Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Limonene has a specific structure—maybe it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond. So hydrogenation would add H2 to the double bond, making it a single bond. So product 1 is the saturated limonane.

But then, how does the next step with mCPBA work? Because mCPBA is an oxidizing agent for epoxidation, but without a double bond, no epoxidation occurs. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, maybe the first step is not hydrogenation. No, the reagent is Pd/C and H2, so that must be hydrogenation. Oh, wait! Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of another functional group. But limonene doesn't have any other functional groups to hydrogenate, like ketones or something. So I'm stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product after hydrogenation isn't the fully hydrogenated compound. Maybe it's a diastereomer or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of an exocyclic double bond, which would change the structure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is partial, but that doesn't make much sense because Pd/C is a catalyst that usually adds H2 completely.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a substituted double bond. Wait, maybe limonene has a double bond that's part of a ring, and the hydrogenation would saturate it, leading to a bicyclo structure without the double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure more clearly. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So that's product 1.

Then, product 1 is treated with mCPBA. Since product 1 is saturated (no double bonds), mCPBA wouldn't react. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm missing a step or the starting material is different.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial hydrogenation is not of the double bond but another part, but limonene doesn't have any other double bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a substituted position. Maybe the hydrogenation leads to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is hydrogenolysis, but I'm not sure. Another thought: maybe the reaction is a hydrogenation of a ketone, but limonene doesn't have a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 isn't the hydrogenated limonene but a different product. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the double bond but of the substituents. Hmm, but limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with isoprenoid substituents. Oh wait, limonene has a substituent, perhaps a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is of a double bond in a substituent, but I don't think limonene has that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the subsequent steps. Because product 1 is treated with mCPBA to form product 2, which then is treated with sodium methoxide to form product 3, and then with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP to form product 4.

Wait, after mCPBA, which is an oxidizing agent, perhaps it's adding an epoxide. So product 1 must have a double bond for that. So perhaps product 1 isn't the hydrogenated limonene, but has another double bond.

Wait, that would mean that the hydrogenation didn't affect the main double bond. That can't be right because limonene's structure is such that Pd/C would hydrogenate the double bond. Maybe the initial structure isn't the one I'm thinking of.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of limonene. Let me think again.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but another possible structure is a substituted cyclohexene. Alternatively, maybe limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which upon hydrogenation becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Wait, but then mCPBA wouldn't do anything. So perhaps the hydrogenation is of a different double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is an allylic hydrogenation. Wait, but I don't think Pd/C does that. It's usually for hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrogenation is not of limonene itself but of some other part of the molecule. Maybe the limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like an exocyclic double bond, which upon hydrogenation becomes a single bond.

Wait, but limonene's structure is a bicyclic structure with a single double bond in the ring. So hydrogenation would saturate that, leaving no double bonds. So then the next step with mCPBA wouldn't do anything. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Step 1: (R)-limonene + Pd/C, H2 → product 1 (after 1 eq H2 consumed). So it's hydrogenated, but since limonene has one double bond, 1 eq of H2 adds across it, making a single bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonane.

But then, product 1 has no double bonds, so mCPBA wouldn't react. Therefore, product 2 would be same as product 1. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, but perhaps the product 1 is something else. Maybe the hydrogenation isn't of the main double bond but of some other group. For example, maybe limonene has a double bond that isn't part of the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. But the presence of Pd/C and H2 suggests hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to ring-opening or another structural change. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps the initial limonene isn't a bicyclic structure. Maybe it's a monocyclic cyclic monoterpene with a substituent. Let me think. If limonene is a substituted cyclohexene, hydrogenation would give cyclohexane.

Wait, but (R)-limonene is a bicyclic compound, I think. So maybe the hydrogenation leads to a structure that still has a double bond elsewhere? No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not complete, so product 1 still has a double bond. But under Pd/C and H2, the reaction should go to completion. So this is confusing.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hydrogenation isn't of the main double bond but of another part. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation of an exocyclic double bond. For example, if limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like an isoprenoid chain.

Wait, limonene has a structure that includes a substituent like a methyl group attached to the ring. Wait, but the main structure is the ring with the double bond. So perhaps the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't the first step. Maybe the first step is a different reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is not of the limonene itself but of a solvent, like methanol. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the reactions. Let me think about the entire process.

After the hydrogenation (step 1), product 1 is treated with mCPBA (step 2) to form product 2. Then product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide (step 3), and then product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP (step 4) to form product 4.

Wait, if product 1 doesn't have a double bond, step 2 (mCPBA) does nothing. Then product 2 is same as product 1. Then step 3 is treatment with sodium methoxide. What does that do? Sodium methoxide is a strong base and can induce elimination, maybe. Alternatively, if product 2 is same as product 1, which is a bicyclo structure, maybe it's a tertiary alcohol or something. Wait, no, product 1 comes from hydrogenation, which usually doesn't add any functional groups.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the first step. Maybe the first step isn't hydrogenation. But that can't be because the reagents are Pd/C and H2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial limonene is a ketone or another functional group that can undergo hydrogenation. But wait, limonene is a terpene; I think it's a hydrocarbon with a double bond.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should move on to the other steps and see if that gives me any clues.

After product 2 is formed, it's treated with sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide is a strong base. It can cause elimination reactions or deprotonation. Maybe product 2 has an epoxide, which when treated with a base would open. So if product 2 is an epoxide, then step 3 would be ring-opening.

Wait, but if product 1 didn't have a double bond, then product 2 can't have an epoxide. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the options and see if I can figure out what the transformations are leading to.

Looking at the options, they're all cyclic structures with substituents like isopropyl, methoxy, methyl, and propionate groups.

Option A: (1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option B: (1S,2R,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option C: (1S,2S,5R)-5-isopropyl-2-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexyl propionate.

Option D: 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate.

Hmm. Well, the options all involve cyclohexyl groups with various substituents and propionate esters.

Product 4 is formed by treating product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. DCC is a coupling agent, and DMAP is a catalyst. So that's a coupling reaction, probably forming an ester. So product 3 must have a hydroxyl group, and propanoic acid would form an ester with it, using DCC as the coupling agent.

So product 3 is an alcohol, and product 4 is the ester.

Before that, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with sodium methoxide. So product 2 must have a functional group that reacts with a base to form an alcohol. Alternatively, product 2 is an epoxide, and the base opens it to form an alcohol. So product 3 would be a diol, perhaps, but then how would that form an ester?

Wait, maybe product 2 is an epoxide, and the base opens it to form a diol. Then, treatment with propanoic acid, etc., would form an ester at one of the diol's hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but let's think again.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Limonene → product 1 (hydrogenation)
2. Product 1 → product 2 (mCPBA)
3. Product 2 → product 3 (NaOme)
4. Product 3 → product 4 (propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP)

So step 4 is forming an ester from an alcohol.

Assuming product 3 is an alcohol, then product 4 is the ester.

Now, step 3: product 2 → product 3 with sodium methoxide.

If product 2 is an epoxide, then sodium methoxide (a strong base) would open the epoxide. Epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions typically leads to the formation of an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives an alcohol.

So, product 3 would be a diol, but wait, if the epoxide is opened in a specific way, perhaps it's a vicinal diol, but that would require two hydroxyl groups.

But then, step 4 is forming an ester from an alcohol. If product 3 has two -OH groups, perhaps one is deprotonated and the other forms the ester. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base in step 3 is causing an elimination reaction, but that depends on the structure.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 could be an epoxide, which upon treatment with base forms a diol. Then, in step 4, one of the diol's OH groups is converted to an ester. Alternatively, the diol could lose water to form an alkene, but that's more under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the base in step 3 is causing an elimination, forming a new double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but let's go back to product 1. If product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a bicyclo structure without any double bonds, then product 2 would be the same as product 1, and product 3 would be the same as product 1. But then, product 3 is treated to form an ester, which doesn't make sense because product 3 would be the bicyclo structure, which doesn't have any OH groups.

So perhaps my earlier assumption about the first step is incorrect. Maybe the hydrogenation doesn't saturate the double bond.

Wait, but the reaction is under H2 and Pd/C. That should hydrogenate the double bond.

Wait, unless the limonene has an exocyclic double bond that's not in the ring. For example, maybe limonene has a substituent with a double bond, like a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the hydrogenation would saturate that, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. Then, product 1 would still have a double bond in the ring, which would react with mCPBA to form an epoxide.

That could make sense. Let me think about this.

If limonene has a substituent with a double bond, such as a vinyl group, then hydrogenation would hydrogenate that substituent, leaving the main ring's double bond untouched. So product 1 would have the main double bond still present.

Then, mCPBA would epoxidize that double bond in product 1, forming an epoxide in product 2. Then, product 2 would be an epoxide, which when treated with a base like sodium methoxide would open the epoxide. The base would deprotonate and cause the epoxide to ring-open, forming an alcohol.

Wait, but if the epoxide is in a ring structure, the ring-opening would lead to a diol, or perhaps a diastereomer. Then, treatment with sodium methoxide would form an alcohol, which would then be esterified in the next step.

But wait, let me think about the structure. Let's say limonene has a substituent with a double bond, such as a methyl group attached to a CH2-CH2 group, which upon hydrogenation becomes CH2-CH3. Then, the main ring's double bond is still present.

So, step 1: hydrogenation of the substituent's double bond, leaving the main ring's double bond.

Step 2: mCPBA epoxidizes the main ring's double bond.

Step 3: sodium methoxide opens the epoxide, perhaps via a ring-opening reaction, which would form two OH groups or maybe eliminate to form a diol.

Wait, but sodium methoxide is a strong base; in an epoxide ring-opening, the base would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which attacks the less substituted oxygen, leading to the opening of the epoxide.

Wait, but in a cyclic epoxide, the ring-opening would form a diol. So product 3 would be a diol.

Then, step 4: treating product 3 with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP would form an ester by coupling the acid with an alcohol.

But how would that work if there are two OH groups? Perhaps one of them is a primary alcohol, which is more reactive, and the other is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, which is less reactive. So the primary OH would react with the acid to form the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is set up such that one OH is in a position that's more reactive towards the esterification.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of the products.

Looking at the options, option D is interesting because it has a cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group. That suggests that the product still has a double bond, perhaps from a ring-opening or another reaction.

Wait, but in the step 4, the ester is formed. So perhaps, in product 3, there's an alcohol that's in a position that, when esterified, leads to one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial hydrogenation doesn't affect the main ring. Let me think: If the main ring's double bond is untouched, then mCPBA would epoxidize it, leading to product 2 as an epoxide. Then, treatment with sodium methoxide would open the epoxide, perhaps leading to an alcohol.

Wait, but earlier I thought that product 1 would have the main double bond saturated, but perhaps I was wrong. Maybe the substituent's double bond is hydrogenated, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. That would explain why mCPBA can epoxidize it in step 2.

So, let me re-examine this.

If the starting material is (R)-limonene, which has a double bond in the ring and another double bond in a substituent (like a substituent with a CH2=CH2 group), then hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 would hydrogenate the substituent's double bond. So product 1 would have the substituent as a single bond, leaving the main ring's double bond intact.

Then, product 1 is treated with mCPBA, which epoxidizes the main ring's double bond, forming an epoxide (product 2).

Then, product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide. Sodium methoxide is a strong base and would perform a ring-opening of the epoxide. The ring-opening would involve the base abstracting a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, leading to the formation of an alkoxide which attacks the less hindered oxygen of the epoxide. This would result in the formation of an alcohol.

Wait, but in a cyclic epoxide, the ring-opening would form a diol, but depending on the structure, perhaps it's a vicinal diol. Then, product 3 would be a diol.

But then, product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP. DCC is a coupling agent used in forming esters or amides. So, the diol would have two OH groups. The reaction would likely esterify one of the OH groups with the propanoic acid, using DCC as the coupling agent.

But wait, DCC is used with carboxylic acids and alcohols to form esters. So if product 3 has an alcohol, and it's treated with a carboxylic acid (propanoic acid) and DCC, it would form an ester.

But in product 3, if there are two OH groups, perhaps the more accessible one (like a primary or secondary alcohol) would react, leaving the other as a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

But this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at option D: 1-methoxy-2-((S)-4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-yl propionate.

This structure has a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at position 3), a methoxy group, and a propionate ester. So, perhaps limonene's structure or some intermediate still has a double bond, leading to the presence of a cyclohexene in product 4.

Wait, but product 4 is formed after all the steps, including hydrogenation, epoxidation, ring-opening, and esterification. So the presence of a double bond in product 4 would suggest that one of the steps re-introduced a double bond.

Hmm. Let me think about each step again.

1. (R)-limonene → Pd/C, H2 → product 1. If limonene has a substituent with a double bond, product 1 would hydrogenate that, leaving the main ring's double bond intact.

2. product 1 → mCPBA → product 2. mCPBA would epoxidize the main ring's double bond.

3. product 2 → NaOme → product 3. Sodium methoxide opens the epoxide, forming an alcohol.

If the epoxide is in a ring, the ring-opening could form a diol, leading to a cyclohexane diol. But perhaps in this case, the ring-opening leads to a new structure with an alcohol group.

4. product 3 → propanoic acid, DCC, DMAP → product 4. This forms an ester from the alcohol in product 3.

Now, considering the options, option D has a cyclohexene ring. That suggests that the double bond is present in product 4. So, perhaps in product 3, there's a structure that, upon esterification, doesn't affect the double bond.

Wait, but product 3 comes from the ring-opening of an epoxide, which usually doesn't form double bonds. Unless the ring-opening is accompanied by elimination.

Wait, sodium methoxide is a base. If the ring-opening of the epoxide under basic conditions leads to the formation of a double bond via elimination, that could explain the presence of a cyclohexene in product 4.

So, step 3: product 2 (epoxide) → treated with NaOme. The base could open the epoxide and abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond via elimination. So, product 3 would have a double bond where the epoxide was.

Then, product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, DCC, and DMAP to form an ester. So, product 4 would have a double bond and an ester group.

Looking at option D, it has a cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group. So, the double bond is at position 3, meaning that during the ring-opening, an elimination occurred to form a double bond.

So, putting it all together:

- Step 1: Hydrogenation of a substituent double bond, leaving the main ring's double bond.

- Step 2: Epoxidation of the main ring's double bond.

- Step 3: Base-induced ring-opening of the epoxide, leading to elimination and formation of a double bond.

- Step 4: Esterification of an alcohol to form a propionate ester.

Therefore, product 4 would have a cyclohexene ring and an ester group.

Looking at the options, option D is the only one with a cyclohexene ring. The other options are cyclohexane derivatives.

So, option D is a possible candidate.

But let me check the other options. Option A has a cyclohexyl group with substituents, but no double bond. So, that would require that the final product doesn't have a double bond, which would only happen if the epoxide wasn't opened by elimination.

In our scenario, the base opens the epoxide and induces elimination, forming a double bond. So, product 4 would have a double bond.

Therefore, the correct option must be D.

Wait, but I should also consider the stereochemistry. Limonene is (R) configuration. How does that affect the final product?

In the initial step, the hydrogenation would lead to a specific configuration. Then, the epoxidation would form the epoxide with certain stereochemistry. The ring-opening with a base would form the diol or the double bond with specific stereochemistry.

In option D, the cyclohexene has an (S) configuration at position 4 (as per the substituents). So, the configuration would depend on the steps.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's a bit challenging, but based on the presence of the double bond, option D seems correct.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the final answer:

1. **Step 1: Hydrogenation**  
   (R)-(+)-Limonene is treated with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond in its ring structure. The hydrogenation reaction adds hydrogen across the double bond, saturating it. However, limonene also has a substituent with a double bond (e.g., a vinyl group). The hydrogenation selectively saturates this substituent, leaving the main ring's double bond intact. Thus, product 1 retains the main ring's double bond.

2. **Step 2: Epoxidation**  
   Product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which reacts with the double bond in the main ring to form an epoxide. This results in product 2, which is an epoxide.

3. **Step 3: Base-Induced Ring-Opening**  
   Product 2 is treated with sodium methoxide, a strong base. The base opens the epoxide ring. Under these conditions, elimination can occur, leading to the formation of a double bond in the main ring. This results in product 3, which is a compound with a double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

4. **Step 4: Esterification**  
   Product 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). DCC is a coupling agent used to form esters. One of the hydroxyl groups in product 3 reacts with the propanoic acid to form a propionate ester, resulting in product 4.

5. **Analysis of the Options**  
   - **Option A, B, and C**: These options describe cyclohexane derivatives with no double bond. This contradicts the reaction sequence, as the final step involves a compound with a double bond (formed during the base-induced elimination in step 3).  
   - **Option D**: This option describes a cyclohexene derivative with a double bond (cyclohex-3-en-1-yl group) and a propionate ester. This matches the expected structure of product 4, as the double bond is retained after the elimination step, and the ester is formed in the final step.

Based on the reaction sequence and the structural analysis, the correct answer is **Option D**, as it is the only option consistent with the presence of a double bond in the final product.

Answer: D
