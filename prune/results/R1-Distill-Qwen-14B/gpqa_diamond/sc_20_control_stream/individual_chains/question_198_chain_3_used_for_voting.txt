Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let me read through it again. 

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I think this involves complexation equilibria. Cobalt can form complexes with SCN- ions, and each complex has a different stability constant. The stability constant, β, indicates how stable a particular complex is. The higher β is, the more the complex tends to form.

Wait, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 1 to 4. But the question is specifically about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, I think. Because dithiocyanato probably means two SCN- ligands attached. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

But first, I need to model the system. The solution has Co²+ and SCN- which can form various complexes. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the Co species present: Co²+, [Co(SCN)]²+, [Co(SCN)₂]²+, [Co(SCN)₃]^+, and [Co(SCN)₄]^0. Wait, no, the charges might be different. Wait, let's think about each complex.

Each SCN- is a -1 charge. So for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]²+ would have 1 SCN, charge is 2+ → so Co is in +3? Wait no, Co is in +2. Because [Co(SCN)]²+ would be Co²+ plus one SCN-: 2+ + (-1) = +1, but that's not right. Wait no, the formula for the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ would imply that the overall charge is +2. So Co is in +2, and each SCN is -1. So for n=1: Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)]²+ → charge is 2+.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's see: the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ would have Co in +2. Because the charge is +2, and each SCN is -1. So 2+ is Co, plus one SCN-: 2+ + (-1) = +1. Hmm, but that's for the complex. So the formula would be [CoSCN]^+, perhaps? Or [Co(SCN)]²+ would require more negative SCN-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}. Let's say Co is Co²+.

Each SCN- is -1. So the complex would have a charge of 2+ minus n*(1) because each SCN contributes -1. So for n=1: charge is 2+ -1*1 = +1 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

n=2: 2+ -2 = 0 → [Co(SCN)_2] (neutral).

n=3: 2+ -3 = -1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

n=4: 2+ -4 = -2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, that makes sense. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So what's each β for?

Stability constants (formation constants) are given for each complex. The β for a complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from Co²+ and n SCN^-.

So for each n, βn is:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co²+][SCN-]^n )

So, for n=1, β1=9 → K1=9.

n=2: β2=40 → K2=40.

n=3: β3=63 → K3=63.

n=4: β4=16 → K4=16.

Wait, but wait, the order of β might be different. The problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the complexes are in order from n=1 to n=4, with β increasing up to β3 and then dropping for β4.

This could mean the most stable complex is n=3, followed by n=2, then n=1, and n=4 is less stable.

But I'm not sure about that. Anyway, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Dithiocyanato suggests two SCN- ions attached. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is neutral.

So we need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the total Co species.

The total Co concentration is the sum of all species: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But solving for all species might be complicated. Another approach is to use the stability constants to find the distribution of each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the formation of each complex step by step. The formation of each complex depends on the availability of free Co²+ and SCN-.

But considering that SCN- is in excess (0.1 M), which is much higher than the total Co concentration (1e-2 M), so we can assume that the concentration of SCN- doesn't change much upon complex formation. That is, [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M.

This approximation is often made in such problems, especially when the ligand is in large excess.

So, let me proceed under the assumption that [SCN^-] = 0.1 M, and that the concentrations of the complexes are determined by the availability of Co²+ and the stability constants.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentrations of the complexes can be written in terms of x and the β values.

So,

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-] = β1 x (0.1)

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 = β2 x (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3 = β3 x (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4 = β4 x (0.1)^4

But wait, no. Because each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So, for the first complex:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co²+][SCN^-] )

So [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_2], β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 )

So [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2

Same for others.

So with [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M, each complex's concentration is proportional to βn * (0.1)^n * x, where x is [Co²+].

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species:

c = x + β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4 = 1e-2 M.

We can factor out x:

x [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

So, let's compute the terms inside the brackets.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1 *0.1 =9 *0.1=0.9

Term3: β2*(0.1)^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

Term4: β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term5: β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646.

So the total is approximately 2.3646.

Then, x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

So [Co²+] is about 4.225e-3 M.

Now, to find the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2], which is the dithiocyanato complex.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01.

Plugging x ≈4.225e-3:

40 * 4.225e-3 * 0.01 = 40 * 4.225e-5 = (40 *4.225 )e-5.

40 *4.225 = 169 → 169e-5 = 1.69e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3 M.

The total Co concentration is 1e-2 M.

Wait, no, the total Co is sum of all species, which is 1e-2, which we used to find x.

So the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] is (1.69e-3) / (1e-2) )= 0.169 → 16.9%.

Wait, but wait, the options include 16.9% as option D. So the answer would be D.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. Are all [Co(SCN)_2] blue? The problem states that the blue ones are dithiocyanato complexes, so yes. So the calculation seems to indicate 16.9% which is option D.

But let me double-check.

Wait, in the calculation, perhaps I made an approximation that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but in reality, when Co forms complexes, it uses up some SCN-. But given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M and the total Co is 1e-2 M, each Co would need up to 4 SCN, so maximum usage is 4e-2 M, which is much less than 0.1 M. Thus, the approximation holds.

So the calculation should be correct.

Another possible issue: the stability constants. Wait, perhaps the order of the β values affects the distribution. Let me see, β3=63 is the largest, so the [Co(SCN)_3] would be the most abundant, followed by [Co(SCN)_2], then [Co(SCN)], and [Co(SCN)_4] is less. But in our calculation, the [Co(SCN)_2] is 1.69e-3. Let me compute the other species to see their contributions.

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * 0.1 =9 *4.225e-3 *0.1 =9 *4.225e-4 = 3.8025e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2] =40 *4.225e-3 *0.01=1.69e-3.

[Co(SCN)_3] =63 *4.225e-3 * (0.1)^3 =63 *4.225e-3 * 0.001 =63 *4.225e-6 ≈2.66e-4.

[Co(SCN)_4] =16 *4.225e-3 * (0.1)^4 =16 *4.225e-3 * 0.0001=16 *4.225e-7 ≈6.76e-6.

So adding all these:

Co²+ =4.225e-3 → 0.004225 M.

[Co(SCN)]^+ = 0.0038025.

[Co(SCN)_2]=0.00169.

[Co(SCN)_3]=0.000266.

[Co(SCN)_4]= 0.00000676.

Sum: 0.004225 +0.0038025 =0.0080275; +0.00169=0.0097175; +0.000266=0.0099835; +0.00000676≈0.00999026, which is approx 0.01, which matches the total Co concentration of 1e-2. So the calculation seems correct.

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:

( [Co(SCN)_2] ) / c(Co) *100 = (0.00169 /0.01)*100 =16.9%.

So answer D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the complexation equilibria. The stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) describe the formation of complexes [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], and [Co(SCN)₄]. The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
[\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the stability constants, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, \([ \text{Co}^{2+} ] = x\), and the thiocyanate concentration, assumed constant at 0.1 M due to its large excess:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}^+] = \beta_1 x (0.1), \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] = \beta_3 x (0.1)^3, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 x (0.1)^4.
\]

The total cobalt concentration equation becomes:

\[
x \left[ 1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4 \right] = 10^{-2}.
\]

Substituting the stability constants:

\[
\beta_1 (0.1) = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad \beta_2 (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4, \quad \beta_3 (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063, \quad \beta_4 (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016.
\]

Summing these terms:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]\), is:

\[
[\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 0.01 = 1.69 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

The percentage of \([\text{Co(SCN)}_2]\) among all cobalt species is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{c(\text{Co})} \cdot 100 = \frac{1.69 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**.
