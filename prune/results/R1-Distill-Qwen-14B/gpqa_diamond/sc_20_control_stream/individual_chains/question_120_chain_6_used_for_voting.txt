Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution implies that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So, the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax... right, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to our changing position in orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that plx (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the number of stars per unit plx range. So we're looking for N(>plx) or the number in a certain plx interval. Let me think in terms of distance. Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if plx increases, the distance d decreases.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is uniform. So in a shell at distance d with thickness dd, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So for a given range of d, the number of stars is proportional to d² dd.

But we want to relate this to plx. Let's substitute d = 1/plx. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, but since plx is decreasing as d increases, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

The number of stars per unit volume in space is n. So the number in a shell between d and d+dd is n * 4πd² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in:

Number of stars, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd).

But how does dd relate to plx? Since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/d²) d plx. Let me write that as dd = (-1/(d²)) d plx. Because d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx², so 1/d² = plx². So substituting:

dd = - plx² d plx.

Wait, maybe I should express dd in terms of plx. Let's take the derivative d d = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So dd/d plx = d/d plx (1/plx) )= -1/(plx²). So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Now substituting back into dN, which is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

So,

dN = n *4π (1/plx²) * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ]

Wait, but since we're considering d plx positive (as plx increases, d is decreasing), perhaps I should take the absolute value, so the negative goes away.

So,

dN = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx )

= n *4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with plx. So, for each unit increase in plx, the number per unit range goes down as 1/plx^4. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of plx as a function of plx. So, for a given plx, how many stars are there in a small range d plx around that plx.

From the above, dN is proportional to 1/plx^4 times d plx. So the number per unit plx (dN/d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density as a function of plx is ~ 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another approach: parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So the number of stars in a certain range of parallax would depend on the volume at that distance. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. But since r is 1/plx, r = 1/plx → dr = -1/(plx)^2 d plx.

So for a given dr, the number of stars is proportional to r² dr = (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 d plx) ) → so number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Yes, that seems right. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant throughout space. The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Thus, the number of stars in this shell is \( dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Since parallax is related to distance by \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = 1/\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dd.
\]

Next, we relate \( dd \) to \( d\text{plx} \). Taking the derivative \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), we substitute this into the expression for \( dN \):

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
