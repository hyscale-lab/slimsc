Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. The problem gives me some information about substances A1 to A5, and I need to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, fluorine's oxidation state is 31.96% in A2. Or maybe that's the percentage composition by mass? Wait, oF usually stands for oxidation state, but sometimes it could be other things. Oh, wait, in the context of fluorine, perhaps it's the weight percent. Because oxidation state would be a number, not a percentage. Oh wait, wait. If it's the molar ratio, then 31.96% might be the fractional part. Alternatively, perhaps it's the weight percentage of fluorine in A2. Let me think.

Suppose A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Wait, but since fluorine is a diatomic molecule, the reaction would produce F2 gas. So perhaps A1 is a compound that releases F2 upon decomposition.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is known to be a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a fluorine compound that behaves similarly. 

Substance A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So Y is being reacted with fluorine to form A3. Since Y is an element, maybe it's something like YF3 or YF5, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So A5 is probably a salt that breaks down into some ions when water is present. 

I think I need to figure out what Y is. Let's think about elements that form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. There are several elements that do this, like oxygen, but more likely it's an element that commonly forms multiple fluorides. Let me think: Chlorine, but that's a halogen. Maybe something else. Wait, perhaps Y is Cl, but let me think.

Wait, but I know that some elements form multiple fluorides. For example, sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. So maybe Y is sulfur (S). Or perhaps Y is chlorine, but chlorine typically forms ClF3, ClF5, etc. Wait, but fluorine tends to form binary compounds with elements where it can have high oxidation states.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1. Let's think about what compounds of fluorine decompose upon heating. One possibility is that A1 is a polymeric form of a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one and fluorine. For example, perhaps A1 is ClF3, which decomposes into ClF and F2. But wait, what's the decomposition of ClF3? Let me recall: ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2. So the reaction is 4 ClF3 → 3 ClF + F2. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up with another compound.

Alternatively, another possibility is that A1 could be a more complex fluoride, like perhaps a polyatomic ion. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but A1 oxidizes Xenon. Xenon is in group 18, and is typically unreactive, but under certain conditions, like strong oxidizing agents, it can form compounds. So, perhaps A1 is something like XeF2, but wait, XeF2 is a compound of Xenon with fluorine, but that's when Xenon is oxidized. Wait, but A1 is a compound of Y and F. So Y is another element.

Wait, let me step back. Let me think about the possible binary compounds of Y with fluorine. There are five of them. So Y must be an element that forms five different binary fluorides. Hmm. Which elements form five different fluorides?

Sulfur, for example, forms SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three. Chlorine can form ClF3 and ClF5, but that's two. Wait, maybe I'm forgetting others. Alternatively, maybe Y is phosphorus, which forms PF3, PF5, maybe others. But I'm not sure if phosphorus has five fluorides. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let me assume that A1 is a higher fluoride of Y, which upon decomposition yields a lower fluoride and F2. For example, let's say A1 is YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2. Or perhaps YF3 decomposes into YF and F2. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps A1 is ClF3. Then, ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2. But what's the oxidation state of Cl in ClF3? Cl has a +3 oxidation state. In ClF, Cl is +1. So during decomposition, ClF3 → ClF + F2. So the F in ClF3 is -1 each (since Cl is +3, 3*(-1) + Cl = 0 → Cl is +3). After decomposition, in ClF, F is -1, so each F is -1, and Cl is +1.

Wait, but the problem states that in A2, the oF is 31.96%. Wait, oF could be the oxidation state of fluorine. So if in A2, fluorine's oxidation state is 31.96%, that's approximately +1. Because 31.96% is roughly +1, since +1 is 1, and the atomic weight of F is about 19. So 1/19 is about 5.26%, which doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps oF refers to the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2.

Wait, the problem says: "ɷF=31,96%". So maybe that's the weight percent of fluorine in A2. So, for example, if A2 is ClF, which is ClF. The molar mass of Cl is about 35.5, F is 19. So total is 54.5 g/mol. Fluorine's weight percent is (19)/(54.5) *100 ≈ 34.88%, which is close to 31.96%. Hmm, but 31.96 is lower than that. Maybe another compound.

Wait, perhaps A2 is YF. Let's say Y is Cl. Then YF is ClF. The molar mass is 35.5 + 19 = 54.5 g/mol. F is 19/(54.5) *100 ≈34.88%. Close to 31.96 but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe Y is S. Let's say A2 is SF. The molar mass of SF would be 32.07 + 19 = 51.07. F's weight is 19/51.07 ≈ 37.2%, which is higher than 31.96. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's ClF3. Let me check: ClF3's molar mass is 35.5 + 3*19 = 35.5 +57=92.5 g/mol. The weight percent of F is (57)/(92.5)*100 ≈61.6% which is higher. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine and A2 is ClF. But that gives around 34.88% which is higher than 31.96. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is another element. Let's think: what if Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen doesn't form five binary fluorides, as far as I know. Alternatively, Y could be phosphorus. Let me see: phosphorus fluorides include PF3, PF5, maybe others. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about the decomposition product. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower one. Let me think of a reaction: for example, 2 A1 → 2 A2 + F2. Let's say A1 is YF5. Then, perhaps it decomposes into 2 YF3 + F2. Let me check the molar masses. YF5 would have a molecular weight of Y + 5*19. A2, YF3, would have Y + 3*19. So the fluorine percentage in A2 is (3*19)/(Y +3*19) *100 = 31.96%. Let's set up the equation: (57)/(Y +57) * 100 = 31.96. Solving for Y:

(57)/(Y +57) = 0.3196
Y +57 = 57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178.2
So Y ≈ 178.2 -57 = 121.2. Wait, that's impossible because Y is an element, and the atomic weight can't be that high. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the decomposition wrong. Let's say A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF and F2. So the reaction would be 2 YF3 → 2 YF + F2. Now, in A2, which is YF, the fluorine percentage would be (19)/(Y +19) *100 =31.96%.

So (19)/(Y +19) = 0.3196
Multiply both sides by denominator: 19 = 0.3196*(Y +19)
19 = 0.3196 Y + 0.3196*19
Calculate 0.3196*19: approx 6.0724
So 19 = 0.3196 Y +6.0724
Subtract 6.0724: 19 -6.0724 = 12.9276 = 0.3196 Y
So Y = 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈40.5.

Hmm, that's close to 40, which is the atomic weight of Ca, but that's a metal. Alternatively, maybe Y is S (32.07), but 40.5 is around Ca or perhaps something else. Wait, but 40.5 is close to Zr's atomic weight? No, Zr is around 91. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the decomposition of A1 is different. Let's think of another possibility. Suppose A1 is ClF3. How does ClF3 decompose? I think it decomposes into ClF and F2. So:

4 ClF3 → 3 ClF + F2

In this reaction, each ClF3 (molar mass 35.5 + 3*19 = 35.5 +57=92.5) produces ClF (molar mass 35.5 +19=54.5) and F2 (38).

Now, in ClF, the fluorine percentage is (19)/(54.5) *100 ≈34.88%, which is close to the given 31.96%, but not exactly. Maybe the problem uses approximate values, so perhaps A2 is ClF.

If Y is Cl, then the five binary fluorides would be ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe ClF7? Wait, ClF7 isn't a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: what about Y being Sulfur (S)? The known fluorides include SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three. Maybe others: perhaps S2F2? Hmm, I'm not sure if that's considered a binary compound. Alternatively, maybe other structures, but I'm not sure if that makes five. Hmm.

Wait, another element: perhaps Y is carbon? No, carbon forms only a few fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps Y is nitrogen? Maybe, but I'm not sure about five fluorides.

Wait, perhaps Y is another halogen, like bromine. But bromine typically forms BrF3, BrF5, etc. Let me think. So five compounds: maybe BrF, BrF3, BrF5, and others. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, and others. Let me see: PF3, PF5, maybe others like P2F7, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen, but oxygen doesn't form many fluorides. Wait, but O does form OF2 and possibly others. Not five, though.

Wait, let's think about the fluorine compounds that are strong oxidizing agents. Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizer, but the compounds: ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, as is F2 itself. So perhaps A1 is ClF3, which upon decomposition gives ClF and F2.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (which is Cl?) with fluorine. So Cl reacting with F2 would form ClF3? Or ClF5. But wait, ClF3 is formed by Cl2 + F2 under certain conditions. Alternatively, ClF5 is formed when Cl reacts with excess fluorine.

But wait, the problem says A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so Y is Cl. Then, the fluorination of Cl would form various chlorides, like ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc.

Then, when Y (Cl) is added to A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, it forms A5. The solution is hot and concentrated. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A4 is ClF, and adding Cl would form... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF3. Adding Cl in a 1:1 ratio: ClF3 + Cl → Cl2F3? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to think about each step again.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2. A1 oxidizes Xenon, which suggests a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine (F2) is a strong oxidizing agent, but here it's a compound of Y and F.

So perhaps A1 is ClF3, which is a strong oxidizing agent.

When ClF3 decomposes, it forms ClF and F2. So A2 is ClF.

The fluorine content in A2 (ClF) is (19)/(35.45 +19) *100 ≈ (19)/(54.45) *100 ≈34.88%. But the problem states 31.96%, which is a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, maybe A2 is ClF3? No, because that would mean A1 is something else decomposing into ClF3 and F2. That doesn't fit because ClF3 is a higher fluoride than ClF. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let's think about Y being Sulfur. Then, if A1 is SF6, which decomposes into SF4 and F2? Not sure if that happens. Alternatively, perhaps SF6 is stable and doesn't decompose easily.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A1 is a polymeric form of a fluoride, like a higher fluoride that decomposes into a lower one. For example, perhaps YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me calculate the fluorine percentage in YF3.

If A2 is YF3, and its fluorine percentage is 31.96%, then:

(3*19)/(Y + 3*19) = 0.3196

So 57/(Y +57) = 0.3196

Multiply both sides: 57 = 0.3196*(Y +57)

57 = 0.3196Y + 0.3196*57

Calculate 0.3196 *57 ≈18.1752

So 57 -18.1752 ≈ 38.8248 = 0.3196 Y → Y ≈ 38.8248 /0.3196 ≈121.5.

But that's not possible because Y is an element with an atomic weight around that? No, 121 is way too high. The heaviest elements are around 250, but 121 is around Tin (Sn is ~118.71). So Y would be Sn? Wait, but Sn forms how many fluorides? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is Pb or something else. But this approach might be leading me astray.

Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the fluorination of Y to get A3. If Y is Cl, then A3 could be ClF3 or ClF5. But when Cl is added to a solution of A4, which is a fluorinated compound, perhaps A4 is ClF3 or another compound.

Wait, another angle: The decomposition of A5 in water produces two substances. So A5 is likely a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base. For example, NaClO3 decomposes into NaCl and NaClO4 upon heating, but that's not relevant here. Wait, but in water, perhaps it's a fluorinated salt. For example, if A5 is YF, and in water it decomposes into Y and HF. But that would be two substances, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is YF3, which in water might hydrolyze into Y(OH)3 and HF. So, if Y is Al, AlF3 hydrolyzes into Al(OH)3 and HF. But the problem states that A5 is formed by adding Y in 1:1 ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4.

Wait, but what is A4? If A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y (like Al) in 1:1 molar ratio, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF5. When you add Y to YF5, perhaps it forms YF3 and some other compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me think about A4. The solution is colorless and concentrated. Concentrated solutions of some fluorides are colorless. For example, concentrated H2SO4 is colorless but becomes dark when diluted. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of ClF3, which is a yellowish liquid, but maybe under certain conditions it's colorless. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF. ClF is a gas, but in solution, perhaps it's a different story. Wait, but ClF is a diatomic gas, so maybe in solution it's something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible compounds step by step.

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's assume A1 is ClF3. Decomposes into 3 ClF and F2? Because the reaction is 4 ClF3 → 3 ClF + F2.

2. So A2 is ClF. Its fluorine percentage is (19)/(35.45 + 19) *100 ≈34.88%. But the problem says 31.96%, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the percentage is of fluorine in A2, which is ClF. So 19/(35.45 +19) = 19/54.45 ≈0.3488 → 34.88%. Not matching the 31.96% given. Hmm. Maybe Y is another element.

Let me try another approach. Let's say A1 is SF6. SF6 is a colorless gas, not bright red. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's ClF5, which is a dark red liquid. Wait, that could fit the bright-red description. ClF5 is a red liquid that decomposes into ClF3 and F2 upon heating.

So let's suppose A1 is ClF5. The decomposition reaction would be ClF5 → ClF3 + F2. Let's balance it: 2 ClF5 → 2 ClF3 + F2. Let me check the molar masses.

ClF5: Cl (35.45) + 5F (95) → 130.45 g/mol.

In A2, which would be ClF3 (molar mass 35.45 + 3*19 = 35.45+57=92.45 g/mol), the fluorine percentage is (57)/(92.45)*100 ≈61.68%. That's higher than 31.96%, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, not matching. So perhaps A1 is not ClF5.

Another possibility: maybe A1 is ClF. ClF is a diatomic gas, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, maybe I should think about the five binary fluorides of Y. Let's assume Y is Cl. The known binary fluorides are ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? Wait, ClF7 is not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some.

Alternatively, Y could be another element. Let's think about Y being O. O forms OF2, but that's not five compounds. Alternatively, Y is N. N forms NF3, maybe others. Not enough.

Wait, another angle: the initial problem says that when Y is added to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y metal in 1:1 ratio would cause a reaction. For example, if Y is Al, then AlF3 + Al → Al2F3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, and adding Y would form YF3 and release F2. But that seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF, and adding Y would cause a displacement reaction. But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the problem mentions that A3 can interact with xenon. So A3 is a compound that reacts with Xenon. Xenon can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. But since A3 is a compound of Y and F, perhaps A3 is something like ClF3 which can oxidize Xenon.

Wait, but if Y is Cl, then A3 is ClF3. ClF3 is a strong oxidizer and could react with Xenon under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps A3 is ClF, which is a weaker oxidizer but can still interact with Xenon.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out the molecular weight of A4 based on the options provided.

The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Assuming Y is Cl, let's think about possible compounds.

If A4 is ClF3, its molecular weight is 35.45 +3*19= 35.45+57=92.45 g/mol, which is way below the options given. So that can't be.

If A4 is ClF5, molecular weight is 35.45 +5*19=35.45+95=130.45, which would fall in option D (110-130). But I'm not sure if ClF5 is the compound.

Wait, but earlier I thought A1 might be ClF5. Let me think again. ClF5 is a red-brown liquid. Does it decompose into ClF3 and F2? Let me think about the reaction:

ClF5 → ClF3 + F2

Wait, let me balance that. Maybe 2 ClF5 → 2 ClF3 + F2.

So for each mole of ClF5, you get 2 moles of ClF3 and 1 mole of F2.

In this case, A2 would be ClF3, which has a molecular weight of 35.45 + 57=92.45. The fluorine percentage is (57)/(92.45)*100 ≈61.68%, which doesn't match the given 31.96%.

Hmm, that approach doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is not Cl.

Let me think of another element. How about Y is Br? Bromine forms BrF3 and BrF5, but I'm not sure about five binary fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element that forms multiple fluorides. Let me think of Y as Sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6. Are there others? Maybe S2F2? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Y as S. So let's say A1 is SF6. SF6 is a gas, colorless. But the problem says A1 is bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is SOF2? I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is I. Iodine forms IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. That's four. Hmm, but the problem states five binary compounds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a metal like Al. Al forms AlF3, which is a common fluoride. But I'm not sure about other fluorides.

Wait, maybe Y is a transition metal. Let me think: perhaps Y is Mn, which can form MnF2, MnF3, MnF4, etc. But I'm not certain about the number of fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a noble gas, but that doesn't make sense because noble gases form few compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a non-metal like S, which forms multiple fluorides.

Let me try to think differently. The decomposition of A1 produces A2 and F2. If A2 has 31.96% fluorine by weight, then:

Assume A2 is YF.

Molar mass of YF is Y + 19.

Fluorine percentage: (19)/(Y+19) *100 =31.96.

So,

19/(Y+19) = 0.3196 → Y+19 = 19 /0.3196 ≈60 → Y ≈60-19=41.

So Y ≈41. Which element has an atomic weight around 41? Titanium (Ti) is about 47.867, but that's higher. Maybe it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps Y is Scandium (Sc, ~45) or something else. But 41 is close to Sc's atomic weight of about 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, if Y is around 40.5, which is close to Zr (zirconium is around 91, so no). Alternatively, perhaps it's Y= Ti (47.87). Then, YF would have a fluorine percentage of 19/(47.87+19)=19/66.87≈28.4%. That's lower than 31.96, but perhaps it's close enough.

Wait, but maybe I should consider another scenario where A2 is YF2. Then, fluorine percentage would be (2*19)/(Y +38) *100 =31.96.

So:

38/(Y+38) = 0.3196 → Y +38 = 38/0.3196 ≈118.8 → Y≈118.8-38=80.8. Which is near the atomic weight of mercury (Hg, about 200.59), but that's too high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, correction: (2*19) is 38, so 38/(Y+38) =0.3196 → Y+38 = 38/0.3196 ≈118.8 → Y≈80.8. No, that's not possible. So perhaps A2 isn't YF2.

Alternatively, maybe A2 is YF3. Then, (3*19)/(Y+57) =0.3196 → 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57 = 57/0.3196≈178 → Y≈178-57=121. Again, that's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the percentages are not calculated correctly, or perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps Y is a diatomic element, like O2 or N2, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with a higher atomic mass.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility that Y is Iron (Fe). Then, let's see: if Y is Fe, then FeF, FeF3, etc. But I'm not sure about their stability or the number of fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a heavier element. Let me think of Y as I. So, let's calculate for Y=I (126.9 g/mol).

If A2 is IF, then (19)/(126.9+19) *100 =19/145.9 ≈12.99%, which is lower than 31.96%. Not matching.

Alternatively, A2 is IF3: (3*19)/(126.9 +3*19) =57/(126.9 +57) =57/183.9≈31.02%. Close to 31.96%, but not exact. Hmm, perhaps that's the case. So Y could be I (Iodine), and A2 is IF3.

But I'm not sure if I is the correct element. Also, the problem states that there are five binary fluorides of Y, so Iodine forms IF, IF3, IF5, and perhaps others. Let me think: I can form IF, IF3, IF5, and maybe IF7. That's four? Or five? I'm not certain, but let's say I is Y.

So if Y is I, then A2 is IF3, which has a fluorine percentage of about 31%, which fits the given 31.96%. So that could be it.

Now, A1 is a binary compound of I and F that decomposes into IF3 and F2. What's A1? Perhaps IF5. Let me think: IF5 decomposes upon heating into IF3 and F2.

The reaction would be: 2 IF5 → 2 IF3 + F2.

In that case, A1 is IF5, A2 is IF3. So the fluorine percentage in IF3 is (3*19)/(126.9 +3*19) =57/(126.9 +57) =57/183.9 ≈31.02%, which is close to the given 31.96%. So perhaps it's a rounded figure.

Now, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (I) with fluorine. So fluorinating I would form IF, IF3, IF5, etc. So A3 could be IF5.

A3 can also interact with Xenon. So perhaps IF5 is a strong oxidizing agent and can oxidize Xenon.

Then, when Y (I) is added in a 1:1 ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. A4 is likely a solution of a iodine fluoride. Let's say A4 is a solution of IF3. When you add I in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps a substitution occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a different compound.

But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of IF, and adding I in 1:1 ratio forms I2 and F^- ions, but that's just a guess.

A5 is the product, which decomposes in water into two substances. So perhaps A5 is IF, which in water would hydrolyze into HF and I. Or maybe it's a different compound.

But the main point is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

If A4 is a solution of IF5, then the molecular weight of IF5 is 126.9 +5*19 =126.9+95=221.9 g/mol. So that falls into option B (220-240).

Alternatively, if A4 is a solution of IF3, its molecular weight is 126.9 +3*19=126.9+57=183.9, which falls into option C (160-180).

Wait, but according to the earlier decomposition, A1 is IF5, which decomposes into IF3 and F2. So A2 is IF3, which has a molecular weight of 183.9. That's in option C (160-180).

But the question is about A4. So if A4 is a solution of IF5, then its molecular weight is about 222, which is in option B. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think: when Y is added to A4's solution, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs. For example, if A4 is a higher fluoride, adding Y (the element) might produce a lower fluoride and release F2.

Assuming Y is I, A4 could be a solution of IF3. Then, adding I in 1:1 ratio might produce something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of IClF4 or another compound, but I'm not familiar with that.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A5 into two substances in water. Let's say A5 is IF, which in water would produce I and HF. So, A5 is IF, which is a diatomic molecule. Its molecular weight is 126.9 +19=145.9 g/mol. So that falls into option D (110-130).

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, if A5 is I2F7, but I don't think that's a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

I'm a bit stuck, but based on the earlier calculations, if Y is I and A4 is IF5, then its molecular weight is about 222, which falls into option B (220-240).

So, perhaps the correct option is B.

The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4 based on the given information about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Assumptions**:
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2 at 293 K.
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine and can also interact with xenon.
   - A4 is a hot, colorless, concentrated solution. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio, A5 is formed.
   - A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Element Y**:
   - Y must form five binary fluorides. This suggests Y is iodine (I), which forms IF, IF3, IF5, and possibly other fluorides.
   - A1 is likely IF5, a red-brown liquid that decomposes into IF3 and F2 upon heating:  
     \[
     2 \, \text{IF}_5 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{IF}_3 + \text{F}_2
     \]
   - A2 is IF3, as its fluorine percentage by mass is approximately 31.96%:  
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of IF}_3 = 126.9 + 3 \times 19 = 183.9 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]

3. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is a hot, colorless, concentrated solution. Based on the decomposition reaction, A4 is likely a solution of IF5.
   - The molecular weight of IF5 is:  
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of IF}_5 = 126.9 + 5 \times 19 = 221.9 \, \text{g/mol}.
     \]

4. **Matching the Molecular Weight Range**:
   - The molecular weight of A4 (IF5) is approximately 221.9 g/mol, which falls within the range **220-240**.

Thus, the molecular weight of A4 falls in the range **220-240**.
