Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions (Ca²+) in this solution.

Wait, formation constant, right. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. And the Kf is 5e10, which is a pretty large number, indicating that the complex is very stable.

But wait, the question is asking about the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Since the K is so large, the complex should dissociate very little, meaning that the free Ca²+ concentration should be really low.

So, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but how does this relate to the dissociation? Oh, right, the dissociation would have an equilibrium based on Kf. The dissociation constant Kd is 1/Kf. Because when you reverse the formation equation, the K becomes 1 over the original K.

So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in solution, the total EDTA comes from both the complex and any free EDTA. But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is the only source of EDTA? Or is the EDTA already in solution as a separate component?

Hmm, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that the initial concentration is all in the form of the complex. So initially, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are zero. But when it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me model this. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 − x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is so small, x will be very tiny compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x (assuming that all the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex)

Wait, but wait a second. If EDTA is present in solution, and it's a ligand, but the problem says it's a stoichiometric complex. So perhaps the molar ratio is 1:1, meaning that each mole of CaEDTA²− gives one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

So the Kd expression is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA²−] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ) ≈ (x²)/0.02 = 2e-11.

Wait, because Kd is 1e-10? Wait wait, no. Kf is 5e10, so Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So set up the equation:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, so 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is equal to sqrt(4e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5). So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is approx 6.32e-7. That would make x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's go through the steps again.

Given [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M.

The Kd is 2e-11.

The equation: x² = Kd * [CaEDTA²−]

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Yes, so the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( K_d \) is very small, dissociation is minimal). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) ions formed from dissociation. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

The Kd is 2e-11.

The equation: x² = Kd * [CaEDTA²−]

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

Yes, so the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That's option C.
