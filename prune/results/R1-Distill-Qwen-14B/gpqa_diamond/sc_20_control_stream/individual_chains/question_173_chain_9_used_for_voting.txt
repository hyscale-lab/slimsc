Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right? Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, I remember that's the one. The problem states that an electron is traveling at a certain speed, and there's an uncertainty in its position. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy.

Let me read the question again. The electron's speed is v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in space (Δx) is 0.1 nm. So, Δx is 0.1 nanometers. I think I should convert that to meters because the standard units are in meters. Oh right, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. But wait, sometimes people approximate it as just Planck's constant because the 2π factor is small compared to the units involved. The formula is Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes it's taken as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. So for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take ΔxΔp = ħ/2.

But wait, maybe I should use the more precise form when doing calculations. Hmm, but let me think, the question is giving me speed v, not momentum. So perhaps I should express the momentum in terms of velocity and mass.

The momentum p is mass times velocity, m*v. But wait, when using the uncertainty principle, we're dealing with Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. So, Δp = m * Δv, but wait, no, because the electron has a definite velocity v, but the uncertainty in momentum comes from the uncertainty in velocity? Or is it because of the uncertainty in position leading to an uncertainty in momentum?

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the electron's position is uncertain, by Δx, which leads to an uncertainty in momentum, Δp, via the uncertainty principle. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum is when equality holds.

Wait, but let's get the units right. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So, using that, I can compute Δp.

So Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx). Let's plug in the numbers.

Δx is 1e-10 m. So 2Δx is 2e-10 m. So Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10) = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives the speed v as 2e8 m/s. So is the uncertainty in velocity (Δv) small compared to v, or is it just that the momentum is m*v, but the uncertainty comes from position?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Uncertainty Principle relates Δx and Δp, not Δv. So for an object moving at some velocity v, the momentum is p = m*v. If there's an uncertainty in position, Δx, it leads to an uncertainty in momentum, Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx). Because Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). So the minimum uncertainty is when Δp is ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, but when the speed is known exactly, then the momentum p is exactly m*v. But if there's an uncertainty in position, that implies an uncertainty in the momentum. That's the basic idea, right? So in this problem, maybe the electron's momentum is m*v, but the uncertainty in momentum is Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Then, the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum.

But wait, the question is about the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. So I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy. Because electrons have kinetic energy based on their momentum. So the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So if p is uncertain by Δp, then the uncertainty in E would be related to that.

Alternatively, using the uncertainty principle for energy and time, but wait no, the problem doesn't give a time uncertainty. So I probably need to use the position-momentum uncertainty and relate it to energy.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². But if the momentum is p = mv, then E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be found using the uncertainty in p. So ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m), because if E = p²/(2m), then ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m) assuming Δp is small compared to p.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think about the differentiation approach. Since E = p²/(2m), the differential dE = (2p)/(2m) dp = (p/m) dp. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) Δp. But p is m v, so (m v)/(m) ) = v. So ΔE ≈ v Δp.

But that would be if Δp is small compared to p. So using that, ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So let me compute Δp again. Since Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). So Δp = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) = approx 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Then ΔE ≈ v * Δp. v is 2e8 m/s. So 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, but that's about 1e-16 J. So looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J, which would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

ΔE = v * Δp = 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = (2 *5.27) * 1e-17 = 10.54e-17 → ~1.05e-16 J.

So about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But wait, let me think again. Another way, sometimes the uncertainty in energy and time is considered, but since we're not given time, perhaps that's not the way to go. Alternatively, the energy uncertainty could come from the momentum uncertainty. Hmm, another approach: The energy is K.E. = (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). Because if E = p²/(2m), then dE = (2p dp)/(2m) ) = (p dp)/m.

Wait, but substituting p = m v, this becomes (m v dp)/m = v dp. So same as before, ΔE ≈ v Δp. So same result as before.

So the calculation seems correct. So the answer would be option D: ~1e-16 J.

But wait, another way to compute it: using ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). Let's see what that gives.

Δp = 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

(5.27e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 * 1e-50 = approx 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49 kg² m²/s².

Then divide by 2m. The mass of the electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. So 2m = 1.822e-30 kg.

So ΔE ≈ 2.777e-49 / 1.822e-30 = approx 1.524e-19 J.

Wait, that's a different number. Now I'm confused. So which approach is correct?

Wait, which approach should I take? The first approach (ΔE ≈ v Δp) gives 1e-16 J, the second approach (ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m)) gives 1.5e-19 J. Hmm, these are vastly different. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think more carefully. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates Δx and Δp, but the uncertainty in energy would relate to Δp through the kinetic energy expression.

Wait, the kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m). So if p is uncertain by Δp, then the uncertainty in E is approximately ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m). Because if E is a function of p, E(p) = p²/(2m), then the uncertainty in E is the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative of E with respect to p is dE/dp = (2p)/(2m) = p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, that's another approach. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Since p = m v, then p/m = v. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

Which brings us back to the first calculation, giving 1e-16 J.

But why the discrepancy in the two methods? Oh wait, because when you calculate using the differential (ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp), it's an approximation for small Δp. But when I computed using (Δp)^2/(2m), that's a different approach. So perhaps I was wrong to use that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the momentum uncertainty and relate that to the energy uncertainty via the derivative.

So, since E = p²/(2m), then the uncertainty in E is ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = (p/m) * Δp. As p = m v, this becomes ΔE ≈ v Δp.

So that's the way to go, leading to ΔE ≈ 1e-16 J.

So that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for v * Δp.

v is 2e8 m/s.

Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Multiplying them: 2e8 * 5.27e-25 = 2 *5.27 = 10.54, and 1e8 * 1e-25 = 1e-17. So 10.54e-17 = 1.054e-16 J. So approximately 1e-16 J.

So the answer should be D.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For the minimum uncertainty, we take \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), so:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the electron is given by \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated using the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) and the relationship:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]

The mass of the electron is \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate \( (\Delta p)^2 \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.777 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Now divide by \( 2m \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.524 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.
