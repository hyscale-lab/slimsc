Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I need to use the theory of relativity, probably special relativity. The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy formula, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, sometimes they refer to kinetic energy as the energy, but I'm not sure here. The question asks for the energy, so I should clarify that. Oh right, RHIC accelerators typically refer to the kinetic energy, but wait, no, for high-energy particles, sometimes it's the total energy (gamma * m c²) that's considered the energy. Hmm, I need to be careful.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that's 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6. So the atomic mass would be approximately that of 6 nucleons.

But wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So I need to calculate its total energy. The formula for total energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate gamma. Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 0.28 is sqrt(0.0784), so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is about 1, yeah. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 1.0072992928 GeV/c². Wait, actually, protons are about 938 MeV/c², but I think for these calculations, I should use the precise value.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Or wait, maybe it's easier to use the average or just the mass of the nucleus.

Alternatively, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01410201388 g/mol. Wait, but I need the mass in terms of GeV/c².

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let's see, the atomic mass is in grams per mole, but I'm thinking in terms of energy. The conversion is 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So Li-6's atomic mass is about 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that. 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, and 0.014102 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.01315. So total is about 5.60215 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually a bit less than 6 u because of binding energy. But since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps the approximation is acceptable, but wait, the exact calculation might be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass energy is given by the sum of the masses of the nucleons. For Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron slightly more. Let's compute that.

So 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 MeV = 2814.816 MeV. 3 neutrons: each is about 939.565 MeV. So 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. Total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. Convert to GeV: 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum of individual nucleon masses. However, this is higher than the actual mass of the nucleus because in reality, the binding energy (nuclear mass defect) causes the nucleus to be less massive than the sum. But in the case of high-energy physics, sometimes when calculating the total energy, they use the sum, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the sum of the masses, because otherwise, we'd have to look up the exact mass of Li-6, which I don't remember.

But wait, the problem statement says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons: total 6 nucleons. So perhaps the rest mass is the sum of their individual masses.

So, using that, the rest mass energy is 6 nucleons times approximately 938 MeV each? No, wait, neutrons are slightly more massive than protons.

Wait, protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons about 939.565 MeV/c². So for each:

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Adding them: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.6335 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy.

Gamma is 3.5714, so 5.6335 * 3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857.

0.6335 * 3.5714 ≈ let's see, 0.6 *3.5714= 2.14284, 0.0335 *3.5714≈0.1198. So together, about 2.2626.

So total is approximately 17.857 + 2.2626 ≈ 20.1196 GeV.

But wait, let me be more accurate.

Compute 5.6335 * 3.57142857.

5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.6335 * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 0.6 * 3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.03 * 3.57142857 = 0.107142857.

0.0035 *3.57142857= 0.0125.

Adding these: 2.142857142 + 0.107142857= 2.25, plus 0.0125 is 2.2625.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.2625 = 20.11964285 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma was a bit rough.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me compute it.

0.0784 is equal to 78.4 * 1e-3. The square of 0.28 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... So that's accurate.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, so more accurately, 5.633511 GeV * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5.633511 * 3.57142857.

Compute 5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857:

Compute 0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.003511 *3.5714= 0.01252.

So 0.107142857 + 0.01252 = 0.119662.

So 2.142857142 + 0.119662 = 2.262519.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.262519 = 20.11966 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.1196 is about 20.12 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Because I used the sum of individual nucleon masses, but the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less due to binding energy. So the rest mass energy is lower than 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.014102 * 931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.014102 *931.5 ≈ 13.15.

Total is 5589+13.15=5602.15 MeV=5.60215 GeV.

Wait, so the rest mass energy is about 5.60215 GeV, not 5.6335 GeV. Because I was adding the masses of individual nucleons, which overestimates the actual mass because of the binding energy.

So that's a mistake. I should use the actual atomic mass of Li-6 in u converted to GeV.

So correct rest mass energy is 5.60215 GeV.

Now, compute 5.60215 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute that:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60215 *3.57142857= ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00215 *3.57142857≈0.00768.

So 2.142857142 + 0.00768 ≈2.1505.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.1505=19.0076 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.008 GeV. But that's not matching any options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1u = 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.014102 u *931.494 = ?

Compute 6.014102 *931.494.

Let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.014102 *931.494 ≈approx 0.014102 *900=12.6918 plus 0.014102*31.494≈0.444, so total about 13.1358.

So total is 5588.964 +13.1358=5602.1 MeV=5.6021 GeV.

So rest mass energy is 5.6021 GeV.

So now, compute 5.6021 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

Then, 0.6021 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021 *3.57142857=0.007500000 (approx).

Wait, 0.0021 *3.57142857 = 0.0075.

So 2.142857142 +0.0075=2.150357142.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.150357142 =20.0075 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV, which is about 20.0075. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, as before. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.6021 *3.57142857 precisely.

Let me perform the multiplication more accurately.

5.6021 *3.57142857.

Let me write it out:

First, break down 3.57142857 into 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

But that might not help. Alternatively, compute 5.6021 *3.57142857.

Compute 5.6021 *3 =16.8063.

5.6021 *0.5=2.80105.

5.6021 *0.07142857 ≈5.6021 * (1/14) = approx 0.40015.

Adding these: 16.8063 +2.80105=19.60735, plus 0.40015=20.0075 GeV.

So total energy is about 20.0075 GeV. So approximately 20.008 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that exactly.

6.014102 *931.5 = ?

Compute:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014102 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.004102 *931.5= approx 3.814.

So 9.315 +3.814=13.129.

So total is 5589 +13.129 =5602.129 MeV =5.602129 GeV.

So rest mass energy is 5.602129 GeV.

Now, 5.602129 *3.57142857 = ?

Compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.602129 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857= 2.142857142.

0.002129 *3.57142857= approx 0.002129 *3.57142857.

Let me compute that: 0.002 *3.57142857 is 0.007142857. 0.000129 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.0004607.

So total is approximately 0.007142857 + 0.0004607≈0.007603557.

So 0.6 part gives 2.142857142, 0.002129 part gives 0.007603557.

Sum: 2.142857142 + 0.007603557 ≈2.1504607.

Total energy: 17.85714285 +2.1504607=20.0076 GeV.

So about 20.0076 GeV. So approximately 20.008 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.008. The closest is option C, 20.132, but that's about 0.124 higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass calculation?

Wait a second, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is not just the sum, but perhaps I should calculate the exact mass of Li-6, which includes the binding energy.

Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the standard atomic weight of ^6Li is approximately 6.014102 u.

So 6.014102 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute it accurately.

6.014102 *931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.014102 *931.494 = compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494, 0.004102 *931.494= approx 3.814.

So 9.31494 +3.814=13.12894.

So total is 5588.964 +13.12894=5602.09294 MeV =5.60209294 GeV.

So 5.602093 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.57142857) precisely.

5.602093 *3.57142857.

Let me compute using more precise steps:

First, 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.602093 *3.57142857.

Let's compute:

0.602093 =0.6 +0.002093.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.002093 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.002 *3.57142857=0.007142857.

0.000093 *3.57142857= approx 0.00033146.

So total is 0.007142857 +0.00033146=0.007474317.

So 0.6 part gives 2.142857142, 0.002093 part gives 0.007474317.

Sum: 2.142857142 +0.007474317=2.150331459.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.150331459=20.007474 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, the options don't have 20.0075. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 higher. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Because perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" — RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per ion. Or is it the total energy?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. In accelerators, sometimes they specify energy as the kinetic energy, sometimes as the total energy.

Let me recall. For example, the LHC specifies the proton's energy as 6.5 TeV, which is the total energy, not just the kinetic. But RHIC's energy is given in terms of the beam energy, which is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, let me think. In high-energy physics, the kinetic energy (K) is often a significant fraction of the total energy (E), especially at lower speeds. But at speeds close to c, the kinetic energy is a substantial part of the total energy.

Wait, but the formula for kinetic energy in relativity is E_k = (gamma - 1) * m c².

So if the question is asking for the total energy, it's gamma * m c². If it's asking for the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1) * m c².

So if the problem says "energy", perhaps it refers to the kinetic energy. Because often, when you hear about the energy of a collider, it refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles.

So let me compute the kinetic energy.

E_k = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma-1=2.57142857.

m c² is 5.602093 GeV.

So E_k =2.57142857 *5.602093.

Compute that:

2 *5.602093=11.204186.

0.57142857 *5.602093.

Compute 0.5 *5.602093=2.8010465.

0.07142857 *5.602093≈approximately 0.40015.

So 2.8010465 +0.40015=3.2011965.

So total E_k=11.204186 +3.2011965=14.4053825 GeV.

So approximately 14.405 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them are near 14 GeV.

Wait, that's a problem. So the options are all around 18-23 GeV.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

But if that's the case, why is the calculated total energy about 20 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and exact multiplication to get more precise.

Wait, let me recompute the rest mass energy precisely.

Li-6 mass:6.014102 u.

1u=931.494063 MeV/c².

So 6.014102 *931.494063 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494063=5588.964378.

0.014102 *931.494063.

Compute 0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063.

0.004102 *931.494063.

0.004 *931.494063=3.725976252.

0.000102 *931.494063≈0.0950243.

So 3.725976252 +0.0950243≈3.821.

So 9.31494063 +3.821=13.13594063.

So total is 5588.964378 +13.13594063=5602.1003186 MeV=5.6021003186 GeV.

So m c² is 5.6021003186 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

Total energy E =5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Compute 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me do this in a more precise way.

Breaking down 3.5714285714 into 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714.

So:

5.6021003186 *3 =16.8063009558.

5.6021003186 *0.5=2.8010501593.

5.6021003186 *0.0714285714.

Compute 5.6021003186 * (1/14) = approx 0.40015.

So adding them up: 16.8063009558 +2.8010501593=19.6073511151 +0.40015=20.0075011151 GeV.

Wait, so about 20.0075 GeV.

Wait, but option C is 20.132, which is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Or perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

That's correct.

So the math seems correct. So why is the option C 20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, if I use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (3 protons and 3 neutrons), what would I get?

Each proton is 938.272 MeV, each neutron about 939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272) =2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565)=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy would be 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈0.01252.

So 0.107142857 +0.01252=0.11966.

So 2.142857142 +0.11966=2.262517.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262517=20.119659 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). But why? Because the actual mass is lower than the sum of the nucleon masses. So if I use the actual mass, E is about 20.0075 GeV, but if I use the sum, it's 20.1197.

But the problem states that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So I should use the accurate mass, which is 6.014102 u.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, which gives option C.

But that's contradictory because the actual rest mass is lower. Hmm, perhaps I should check the exact rest mass.

Wait, the exact rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.014102 u, which is 5.602100 GeV.

So that's correct.

But why is the calculation giving me 20.0075 GeV, but the option is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy as the sum of the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. Wait, no, I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but that would give 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v=0.96c. So beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy per nucleon instead of the nucleus. But that complicates things, and the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy per nucleon and multiply by 6. But that would give a different approach.

Wait, the nucleus has 6 nucleons. So if each nucleon has energy E, the total is 6E.

But no, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus as a whole is moving, not individual nucleons.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy per nucleon, but when multiplied by 6, it gives the total energy.

Wait, but the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma * m_nucleus * c².

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the masses of the nucleons, leading to option C.

But I'm not sure why the problem would expect that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma and exact rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again.

Wait, beta=0.96, so beta²=0.9216.

Gamma squared is 1/(1-beta²) =1/(0.0784)=12.75510204.

So gamma is sqrt(12.75510204)=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the rest mass in terms of the proton mass.

Wait, the actual rest mass of Li-6 might be approximated as m = 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass (since neutrons are about the same mass as protons).

But m_p is about 938.272 MeV/c², so 6 *938.272=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

So using this value, m c²=5.629632 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.629632.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.029632= approx 0.10565.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.10565=2.2485.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2485=20.1056 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.1056 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132), but not exactly.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is needed with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would require using more precise values for gamma and rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of Li-6 is 5.6021003186 GeV, and the exact gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this with more precise steps.

5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

= (5 + 0.6021003186) * (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714)

But perhaps a better approach is to multiply them as decimals.

Alternatively, compute 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me use a calculator approach.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can note that 5.6021003186 ≈5.6021 and 3.5714285714≈3.57142857.

Multiply 5.6021 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6021 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021 *3.57142857=0.0075.

So 2.142857142 +0.0075=2.150357142.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.150357142=20.0075 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

But the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me check the exact value of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact isotopic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102212 u.

So 6.014102212 u *931.494063 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494063=5588.964378.

0.014102212 *931.494063.

Compute 0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063.

0.004102212 *931.494063.

Compute 0.004 *931.494063=3.725976252.

0.000102212 *931.494063≈approx 0.09523.

So sum is 3.725976252 +0.09523=3.821206252.

So 9.31494063 +3.821206252=13.13614688.

So total mass energy is 5588.964378 +13.13614688=5602.100525 MeV=5.602100525 GeV.

So m c²=5.602100525 GeV.

Multiply by gamma=3.5714285714.

5.602100525 *3.5714285714.

Compute 5 *3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.602100525 *3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.002100525 *3.5714285714≈0.007485.

So sum is 2.1428571428 +0.007485=2.1503421428.

Total E=17.857142857 +2.1503421428=20.007485 GeV.

So about 20.0075 GeV.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, which gives around 20.12 GeV, which is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the sum of the masses, perhaps without considering the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think: the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates heavy ions to high energies. The energy in such colliders is usually expressed as the kinetic energy per nucleon or the total energy. But if I assume that the question is asking for the total energy, and the rest mass is based on individual nucleon masses, then the answer is around 20.12 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the rest mass, and I should proceed with the sum of the nucleon masses.

In conclusion, the correct calculation using the accurate rest mass gives about 20.0075 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is when using the sum of the nucleon masses. Since the question provides option C as 20.132, I think that's the intended answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is moving at \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a mass number \( A = 6 \). The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.014102 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.014102 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5602.1005 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using the total energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6021 = 2.150 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these:

\[
E = 17.857 + 2.150 = 20.007 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Address discrepancies with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \), but the closest option provided is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \) (Option C). This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem, such as using the sum of individual nucleon masses instead of the exact nuclear mass. If the sum of nucleon masses is used, the result aligns more closely with Option C.

### Conclusion
Given the options and the reasoning above, the intended answer is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I need to use the theory of relativity, probably special relativity. The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy formula, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, sometimes they refer to kinetic energy as the energy, but I'm not sure here. The question asks for the energy, so I should clarify that. Oh right, RHIC accelerators typically refer to the kinetic energy, but wait, no, for high-energy particles, sometimes it's the total energy (gamma * m c²) that's considered the energy. Hmm, I need to be careful.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that's 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6. So the atomic mass would be approximately that of 6 nucleons.

But wait, the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. So I need to calculate its total energy. The formula for total energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, calculate gamma. Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 0.28 is sqrt(0.0784), so 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 is about 1, yeah. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 1.0072992928 GeV/c². Wait, actually, protons are about 938 MeV/c², but I think for these calculations, I should use the precise value.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Or wait, maybe it's easier to use the average or just the mass of the nucleus.

Alternatively, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.01410201388 g/mol. Wait, but I need the mass in terms of GeV/c².

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let's see, the atomic mass is in grams per mole, but I'm thinking in terms of energy. The conversion is 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u = 0.9315 GeV/c².

So Li-6's atomic mass is about 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Let me compute that. 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, and 0.014102 * 0.9315 is approximately 0.01315. So total is about 5.60215 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is actually a bit less than 6 u because of binding energy. But since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps the approximation is acceptable, but wait, the exact calculation might be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass energy is given by the sum of the masses of the nucleons. For Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron slightly more. Let's compute that.

So 3 protons: 3 * 938.272 MeV = 2814.816 MeV. 3 neutrons: each is about 939.565 MeV. So 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. Total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. Convert to GeV: 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, that's the sum of individual nucleon masses. However, this is higher than the actual mass of the nucleus because in reality, the binding energy (nuclear mass defect) causes the nucleus to be less massive than the sum. But in the case of high-energy physics, sometimes when calculating the total energy, they use the sum, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the sum of the masses, because otherwise, we'd have to look up the exact mass of Li-6, which I don't remember.

But wait, the problem statement says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons: total 6 nucleons. So perhaps the rest mass is the sum of their individual masses.

So, using that, the rest mass energy is 6 nucleons times approximately 938 MeV each? No, wait, neutrons are slightly more massive than protons.

Wait, protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons about 939.565 MeV/c². So for each:

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Adding them: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.6335 GeV.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by this rest mass energy.

Gamma is 3.5714, so 5.6335 * 3.5714 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857.

0.6335 * 3.5714 ≈ let's see, 0.6 *3.5714= 2.14284, 0.0335 *3.5714≈0.1198. So together, about 2.2626.

So total is approximately 17.857 + 2.2626 ≈ 20.1196 GeV.

But wait, let me be more accurate.

Compute 5.6335 * 3.57142857.

5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.6335 * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 0.6 * 3.57142857 = 2.142857142.

0.03 * 3.57142857 = 0.107142857.

0.0035 *3.57142857= 0.0125.

Adding these: 2.142857142 + 0.107142857= 2.25, plus 0.0125 is 2.2625.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.2625 = 20.11964285 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximation of gamma was a bit rough.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

What's sqrt(0.0784)? Let me compute it.

0.0784 is equal to 78.4 * 1e-3. The square of 0.28 is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857... So that's accurate.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Wait, so more accurately, 5.633511 GeV * 3.57142857 = ?

Let me compute 5.633511 * 3.57142857.

Compute 5 * 3.57142857 = 17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857:

Compute 0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.003511 *3.5714= 0.01252.

So 0.107142857 + 0.01252 = 0.119662.

So 2.142857142 + 0.119662 = 2.262519.

So total is 17.85714285 + 2.262519 = 20.11966 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 20.1196 is about 20.12 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Because I used the sum of individual nucleon masses, but the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less due to binding energy. So the rest mass energy is lower than 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.014102 * 931.5 = ?

6 *931.5=5589.

0.014102 *931.5 ≈ 13.15.

Total is 5589+13.15=5602.15 MeV=5.60215 GeV.

Wait, so the rest mass energy is about 5.60215 GeV, not 5.6335 GeV. Because I was adding the masses of individual nucleons, which overestimates the actual mass because of the binding energy.

So that's a mistake. I should use the actual atomic mass of Li-6 in u converted to GeV.

So correct rest mass energy is 5.60215 GeV.

Now, compute 5.60215 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute that:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.60215 *3.57142857= ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.00215 *3.57142857≈0.00768.

So 2.142857142 + 0.00768 ≈2.1505.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.1505=19.0076 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.008 GeV. But that's not matching any options. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1u = 931.494 MeV/c². So 6.014102 u *931.494 = ?

Compute 6.014102 *931.494.

Let me compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.014102 *931.494 ≈approx 0.014102 *900=12.6918 plus 0.014102*31.494≈0.444, so total about 13.1358.

So total is 5588.964 +13.1358=5602.1 MeV=5.6021 GeV.

So rest mass energy is 5.6021 GeV.

So now, compute 5.6021 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

Then, 0.6021 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021 *3.57142857=0.007500000 (approx).

Wait, 0.0021 *3.57142857 = 0.0075.

So 2.142857142 +0.0075=2.150357142.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.150357142 =20.0075 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV, which is about 20.0075. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, as before. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 5.6021 *3.57142857 precisely.

Let me perform the multiplication more accurately.

5.6021 *3.57142857.

Let me write it out:

First, break down 3.57142857 into 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

But that might not help. Alternatively, compute 5.6021 *3.57142857.

Compute 5.6021 *3 =16.8063.

5.6021 *0.5=2.80105.

5.6021 *0.07142857 ≈5.6021 * (1/14) = approx 0.40015.

Adding these: 16.8063 +2.80105=19.60735, plus 0.40015=20.0075 GeV.

So total energy is about 20.0075 GeV. So approximately 20.008 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. So 6.014102 u *931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that exactly.

6.014102 *931.5 = ?

Compute:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.014102 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.004102 *931.5= approx 3.814.

So 9.315 +3.814=13.129.

So total is 5589 +13.129 =5602.129 MeV =5.602129 GeV.

So rest mass energy is 5.602129 GeV.

Now, 5.602129 *3.57142857 = ?

Compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.602129 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857= 2.142857142.

0.002129 *3.57142857= approx 0.002129 *3.57142857.

Let me compute that: 0.002 *3.57142857 is 0.007142857. 0.000129 *3.57142857≈ approx 0.0004607.

So total is approximately 0.007142857 + 0.0004607≈0.007603557.

So 0.6 part gives 2.142857142, 0.002129 part gives 0.007603557.

Sum: 2.142857142 + 0.007603557 ≈2.1504607.

Total energy: 17.85714285 +2.1504607=20.0076 GeV.

So about 20.0076 GeV. So approximately 20.008 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.008. The closest is option C, 20.132, but that's about 0.124 higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass calculation?

Wait a second, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is not just the sum, but perhaps I should calculate the exact mass of Li-6, which includes the binding energy.

Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.014102 u. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the standard atomic weight of ^6Li is approximately 6.014102 u.

So 6.014102 u * 931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute it accurately.

6.014102 *931.494.

Compute 6 *931.494=5588.964.

0.014102 *931.494 = compute 0.01 *931.494=9.31494, 0.004102 *931.494= approx 3.814.

So 9.31494 +3.814=13.12894.

So total is 5588.964 +13.12894=5602.09294 MeV =5.60209294 GeV.

So 5.602093 GeV.

Now, multiply by gamma (3.57142857) precisely.

5.602093 *3.57142857.

Let me compute using more precise steps:

First, 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.602093 *3.57142857.

Let's compute:

0.602093 =0.6 +0.002093.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.002093 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.002 *3.57142857=0.007142857.

0.000093 *3.57142857= approx 0.00033146.

So total is 0.007142857 +0.00033146=0.007474317.

So 0.6 part gives 2.142857142, 0.002093 part gives 0.007474317.

Sum: 2.142857142 +0.007474317=2.150331459.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.150331459=20.007474 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

Hmm, the options don't have 20.0075. The closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.12 higher. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should consider relativistic kinetic energy instead of total energy. Because perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" — RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per ion. Or is it the total energy?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. In accelerators, sometimes they specify energy as the kinetic energy, sometimes as the total energy.

Let me recall. For example, the LHC specifies the proton's energy as 6.5 TeV, which is the total energy, not just the kinetic. But RHIC's energy is given in terms of the beam energy, which is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, let me think. In high-energy physics, the kinetic energy (K) is often a significant fraction of the total energy (E), especially at lower speeds. But at speeds close to c, the kinetic energy is a substantial part of the total energy.

Wait, but the formula for kinetic energy in relativity is E_k = (gamma - 1) * m c².

So if the question is asking for the total energy, it's gamma * m c². If it's asking for the kinetic energy, it's (gamma -1) * m c².

So if the problem says "energy", perhaps it refers to the kinetic energy. Because often, when you hear about the energy of a collider, it refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the particles.

So let me compute the kinetic energy.

E_k = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So gamma-1=2.57142857.

m c² is 5.602093 GeV.

So E_k =2.57142857 *5.602093.

Compute that:

2 *5.602093=11.204186.

0.57142857 *5.602093.

Compute 0.5 *5.602093=2.8010465.

0.07142857 *5.602093≈approximately 0.40015.

So 2.8010465 +0.40015=3.2011965.

So total E_k=11.204186 +3.2011965=14.4053825 GeV.

So approximately 14.405 GeV.

But looking at the options, none of them are near 14 GeV.

Wait, that's a problem. So the options are all around 18-23 GeV.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic.

But if that's the case, why is the calculated total energy about 20 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and exact multiplication to get more precise.

Wait, let me recompute the rest mass energy precisely.

Li-6 mass:6.014102 u.

1u=931.494063 MeV/c².

So 6.014102 *931.494063 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494063=5588.964378.

0.014102 *931.494063.

Compute 0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063.

0.004102 *931.494063.

0.004 *931.494063=3.725976252.

0.000102 *931.494063≈0.0950243.

So 3.725976252 +0.0950243≈3.821.

So 9.31494063 +3.821=13.13594063.

So total is 5588.964378 +13.13594063=5602.1003186 MeV=5.6021003186 GeV.

So m c² is 5.6021003186 GeV.

Gamma is 3.5714285714.

Total energy E =5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Compute 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me do this in a more precise way.

Breaking down 3.5714285714 into 3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714.

So:

5.6021003186 *3 =16.8063009558.

5.6021003186 *0.5=2.8010501593.

5.6021003186 *0.0714285714.

Compute 5.6021003186 * (1/14) = approx 0.40015.

So adding them up: 16.8063009558 +2.8010501593=19.6073511151 +0.40015=20.0075011151 GeV.

Wait, so about 20.0075 GeV.

Wait, but option C is 20.132, which is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Or perhaps I messed up the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

(0.96)^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

That's correct.

So the math seems correct. So why is the option C 20.132 GeV?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, if I use the sum of the individual nucleon masses (3 protons and 3 neutrons), what would I get?

Each proton is 938.272 MeV, each neutron about 939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272) =2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.565)=2818.695 MeV.

Total: 5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Total energy would be 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Compute:

5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.633511 *3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033511 *3.57142857.

0.03 *3.57142857=0.107142857.

0.003511 *3.57142857≈0.01252.

So 0.107142857 +0.01252=0.11966.

So 2.142857142 +0.11966=2.262517.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.262517=20.119659 GeV.

So about 20.1197 GeV.

Which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). But why? Because the actual mass is lower than the sum of the nucleon masses. So if I use the actual mass, E is about 20.0075 GeV, but if I use the sum, it's 20.1197.

But the problem states that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So I should use the accurate mass, which is 6.014102 u.

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, which gives option C.

But that's contradictory because the actual rest mass is lower. Hmm, perhaps I should check the exact rest mass.

Wait, the exact rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is 6.014102 u, which is 5.602100 GeV.

So that's correct.

But why is the calculation giving me 20.0075 GeV, but the option is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy as the sum of the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy multiplied by gamma. Wait, no, I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the kinetic energy, but that would give 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v=0.96c. So beta=0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy per nucleon instead of the nucleus. But that complicates things, and the question says the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy per nucleon and multiply by 6. But that would give a different approach.

Wait, the nucleus has 6 nucleons. So if each nucleon has energy E, the total is 6E.

But no, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus as a whole is moving, not individual nucleons.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy per nucleon, but when multiplied by 6, it gives the total energy.

Wait, but the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma * m_nucleus * c².

So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the masses of the nucleons, leading to option C.

But I'm not sure why the problem would expect that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma and exact rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again.

Wait, beta=0.96, so beta²=0.9216.

Gamma squared is 1/(1-beta²) =1/(0.0784)=12.75510204.

So gamma is sqrt(12.75510204)=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approximation for the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the rest mass in terms of the proton mass.

Wait, the actual rest mass of Li-6 might be approximated as m = 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass (since neutrons are about the same mass as protons).

But m_p is about 938.272 MeV/c², so 6 *938.272=5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

So using this value, m c²=5.629632 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.629632.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.029632= approx 0.10565.

So sum is 2.142857142 +0.10565=2.2485.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2485=20.1056 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.1056 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132), but not exactly.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is needed with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would require using more precise values for gamma and rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of Li-6 is 5.6021003186 GeV, and the exact gamma is 3.5714285714.

So 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me compute this with more precise steps.

5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

= (5 + 0.6021003186) * (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714285714)

But perhaps a better approach is to multiply them as decimals.

Alternatively, compute 5.6021003186 *3.5714285714.

Let me use a calculator approach.

But without a calculator, perhaps I can note that 5.6021003186 ≈5.6021 and 3.5714285714≈3.57142857.

Multiply 5.6021 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.6021 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0021 *3.57142857=0.0075.

So 2.142857142 +0.0075=2.150357142.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.150357142=20.0075 GeV.

So approximately 20.0075 GeV.

But the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me check the exact value of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact isotopic mass of Li-6 is 6.014102212 u.

So 6.014102212 u *931.494063 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.494063=5588.964378.

0.014102212 *931.494063.

Compute 0.01 *931.494063=9.31494063.

0.004102212 *931.494063.

Compute 0.004 *931.494063=3.725976252.

0.000102212 *931.494063≈approx 0.09523.

So sum is 3.725976252 +0.09523=3.821206252.

So 9.31494063 +3.821206252=13.13614688.

So total mass energy is 5588.964378 +13.13614688=5602.100525 MeV=5.602100525 GeV.

So m c²=5.602100525 GeV.

Multiply by gamma=3.5714285714.

5.602100525 *3.5714285714.

Compute 5 *3.5714285714=17.857142857.

0.602100525 *3.5714285714.

Compute 0.6 *3.5714285714=2.1428571428.

0.002100525 *3.5714285714≈0.007485.

So sum is 2.1428571428 +0.007485=2.1503421428.

Total E=17.857142857 +2.1503421428=20.007485 GeV.

So about 20.0075 GeV.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, which gives around 20.12 GeV, which is closest to option C, 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the sum of the masses, perhaps without considering the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think: the question is about the energy of the RHIC, which accelerates heavy ions to high energies. The energy in such colliders is usually expressed as the kinetic energy per nucleon or the total energy. But if I assume that the question is asking for the total energy, and the rest mass is based on individual nucleon masses, then the answer is around 20.12 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the rest mass, and I should proceed with the sum of the nucleon masses.

In conclusion, the correct calculation using the accurate rest mass gives about 20.0075 GeV, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is when using the sum of the nucleon masses. Since the question provides option C as 20.132, I think that's the intended answer.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is moving at \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has a mass number \( A = 6 \). The rest mass of Li-6 is approximately \( 6.014102 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m c^2 = 6.014102 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5602.1005 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using the total energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.6021 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.6021 = 2.150 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Adding these:

\[
E = 17.857 + 2.150 = 20.007 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Address discrepancies with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.007 \, \text{GeV} \), but the closest option provided is \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \) (Option C). This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem, such as using the sum of individual nucleon masses instead of the exact nuclear mass. If the sum of nucleon masses is used, the result aligns more closely with Option C.

### Conclusion
Given the options and the reasoning above, the intended answer is:

**Answer: C**
